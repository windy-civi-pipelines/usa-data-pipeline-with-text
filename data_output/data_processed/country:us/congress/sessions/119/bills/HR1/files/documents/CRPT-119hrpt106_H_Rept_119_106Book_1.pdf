INTRODUCTION BY THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET
This legislation is the principal vehicle to advance President
Trump’s America First agenda. It delivers tax relief for Americans,
reforms entitlement programs to ensure they are serving the most
vulnerable, keeps our nation safe, and rolls back burdensome, ex-
pansive government regulations.
The gross federal debt is currently $36.2 trillion—121 percent of
GDP. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
(CBO), it is projected to increase to $59.2 trillion in 2035—134.8
percent of GDP. The fiscal year 2025 deficit is projected to be $1.9
trillion and CBO projects that by 2035 the annual deficit will have
grown to $2.5 trillion.
As the Nation’s debt and deficits have grown so has interest
spending. Interest spending this year is estimated to be $952 bil-
lion or 3.2 percent of GDP and exceeds what we spend each year
on our military. CBO estimates that over the decade interest
spending will total $13.8 trillion and consume up to forty percent
of all individual income taxes. These interest payments provide no
benefits and finance no government service or operations. Instead,
they divert resources from true needs.
Spending is also estimated to explode, from $7 trillion annually
in 2025 to $10.6 trillion in 2035. As a share of the economy, future
spending is estimated to average 24.9 percent over the next thirty
years, well above the historic average of 21.1 percent. Revenues, in
contrast, increase as a percentage of GDP, growing from the histor-
ical average of 17.3 percent to an average of 18.6 percent over the
next three decades. Excessive spending, not insufficient revenue,
explains the surge in annual deficits.
The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025,
H. Con. Res. 14, provided the framework to implement President
Trump’s America First agenda and reduce spending by at least
$1.5 trillion over fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
Pursuant to section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,
the Committee on the Budget binds together the submissions from
the 11 instructed authorizing committees, without substantive revi-
sion, and reports the reconciliation bill to the House of Representa-
tives.
This reconciliation bill contains the legislative recommendations
marked up by the 11 authorizing committees of the House of Rep-
resentatives pursuant to the reconciliation instructions included in
H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fis-
cal Year 2025. These legislative recommendations were transmitted
to the Committee on the Budget. CBO has confirmed that ten of
the eleven submissions satisfied the instructions for the House au-
thorizing committees instructed in H. Con. Res. 14. Although the
House Committee on Armed Services exceeded its instruction, the
legislative recommendations transmitted by the House Committee

on Armed Services comply with the instruction given to the Senate
Committee on Armed Services in H. Con. Res. 14.
This reconciliation bill addresses unchecked, automatic manda-
tory spending and tackles the fraud, waste, and unnecessary
spending that will saddle our children with a debt they never voted
for. This bill encompasses the single largest package of mandatory
savings ever advanced by Congress. The policies in the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act accomplish these reforms in a fiscally responsible
package that will make our country stronger, safer, and more sol-
vent.

BRIEF EXPLANATION
The provisions passed by the Committee reduce the deficit within
the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture, as instructed by
H. Con. Res. 14, establishing the congressional budget for the
United States Government for Fiscal Year 2025 and setting forth
the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2026 through
2034, as passed by the House of Representatives on February 18,
2025.
PURPOSE AND NEED
The House Concurrent Resolution, H. Con. Res. 14, included
budget reconciliation instructions directing the Committee on Agri-
culture to report changes in laws within its jurisdiction that result
in decreases to the deficit of not less than $230,000,000,000 for fis-
cal years 2025 through 2034. The Committee on Agriculture re-
ported provisions out of Committee that meet those instructions by
making much needed and overdue reforms to the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and providing the resources
necessary to shore up the farm safety net and invest in other crit-
ical functions.
Though intended to supplement the food budget for low-income
individuals, due to a lack of effective oversight by Congress, over-
reach by the executive branch and States in administration of the
program, and a weakening of statutory provisions intended to pro-
mote work, SNAP has ballooned in cost and is not effectively serv-
ing those who truly need the benefit. Since 2019, SNAP rolls have
increased by 17 percent, from 36 million in 2019 to 42 million
today, meanwhile the overall cost of the program has grown by 83
percent, ballooning from $60 billion to $110 billion annually. The
Congressional Budget Office projects Federal outlays on SNAP to
exceed $115 billion by 2035. This is an unsustainable trajectory
that threatens the longterm integrity and health of the SNAP pro-
gram.
Because the SNAP benefit is 100 percent funded by the Federal
government, there is minimal incentive for States to control costs,
enhance efficiencies, and improve outcomes for recipients. Instead,
we have seen States discourage work and expand benefits for those
the program was not intended to serve.
Despite a time limit and work requirement enshrined in law for
Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) on SNAP, only
28 percent of these individuals have earned income from work.
USDA and States have intentionally limited enforcement of the
SNAP work requirement for ABAWDs through waivers, leaving 40
percent of these work-ready individuals today under a waiver of
the ABAWD work requirement, remaining on the SNAP rolls long
after the three-month time limit.
Moreover, the statutory gross monthly income limit is set at 130
percent of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) for SNAP eligibility. The
statute also specifies certain asset limits. Nonetheless, 44 States
have opted into some form of Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility

(BBCE), a loophole in the law that the Obama Administration ex-
ploited to allow States to increase SNAP eligibility up to 200 per-
cent of the FPL and waive asset limits entirely simply because an
individual is receiving a brochure from another welfare program.
This loophole violates the income and asset limits set in the law
by Congress.
Increasing SNAP caseloads have consequences for those this pro-
gram was intended to serve. States, who administer the program,
collectively make close to $13 billion per year in erroneous pay-
ments, both overpayments and underpayments, to participants in
the SNAP program. Error rates for individual States range from
over 60 percent to less than 5 percent, with a national average
error rate of 11.68 percent, which has nearly doubled since 2019.
Moreover, the majority of SNAP State agencies are out of compli-
ance with processing applications on time. Federal law is clear:
States must process SNAP applications within 30 days for most
households, and seven days for those who are elderly or disabled.
This failure by the States means families in need are waiting too
long for assistance.
The provisions reported out of the Committee on Agriculture
achieve significant savings for taxpayers through common sense re-
forms to SNAP including preventing the executive branch from uni-
laterally increasing SNAP benefits without Congressional author-
ity, ensuring that able-bodied adults who can work do work, lim-
iting the ability of States to take advantage of loopholes in the law
that allow them to inflate SNAP benefits regardless of true need,
and encouraging States to administer the SNAP program more effi-
ciently and effectively.
Since the enactment of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018
(PL 115–334, 2018 Farm Bill) total production costs for producers
have increased by over 30 percent. This, coupled with steep and
rapid declines in commodity prices from recent highs, has resulted
in negative projected returns for all major row crops. Some com-
modities are on their third consecutive year of negative returns,
eroding farmers’ balance sheets and driving a 55 percent year-over-
year increase in Chapter 12 (farm) bankruptcies. These conditions
in the farm economy are what the Title I commodity policy provi-
sions were intended to help mitigate. However, due to inflation, the
effective support provided by the current policies is almost neg-
ligible. The combination of worsening economic conditions, con-
cerning increases in farmer debt, and lack of a sufficient safety net,
compelled Congress in December of 2024 via the American Relief
Act, 2025 (PL 118–158) to provide $10 billion in emergency ad hoc
assistance to row crop producers and over $20 billion to com-
pensate farmers impacted by natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.
While this assistance was critical for many producers to service
debt and secure operating loans for crop year 2025, relying on cost-
ly and unbudgeted aid is not a sustainable trajectory for the tax-
payer or for producers who need a more reliable and predictable
safety net to make long-term business decisions.
To mitigate the need for future unbudgeted assistance—which
has grown to $130 billion since 2018—the Committee included pro-
visions to make targeted and strategic enhancements to the farm
safety net. These improvements focus on Title I commodity policy,

designed to assist farmers during periods of low prices, as well as
crop insurance, where average coverage levels have stagnated since
2000, when the last significant reforms were made.
The Committee also sought to address other key priorities in its
jurisdiction such as: increasing investment in trade promotion ac-
tivities, which assist the export dependent agriculture sector with
finding foreign markets for U.S. food, feed, and fuel; enhancing
livestock biosecurity programming to prepare for, prevent, and re-
spond to animal disease outbreaks which could devastate livestock
and poultry industries; investing in public research infrastructure
to spur innovation and aid the U.S. in regaining global dominance
in new agricultural technologies; and provide a continuation of
funding for other policies that are vital to improving rural pros-
perity and economic development.
SECTION BY SECTION
SUBTITLE A—NUTRITION
Sec. 10001. Thrifty Food Plan.
Section 10001 amends section 3(u) of the Food and Nutrition Act
of 2008 to provide a cost neutrality provision that would prevent
the Secretary from increasing the cost of the thrifty food plan based
on a reevaluation or update of market baskets, which under this
section may not occur more frequently than every 5 years. This sec-
tion also requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register
with an opportunity for comment a notice prior to any update of
the thrifty food plan market baskets. Under section 3(u)(4), the
Secretary would be required to adjust the cost of the thrifty food
plan to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index.
Sec. 10002. Able Bodied Adults Without Dependents Work Require-
ments.
Subsection (a) of section 10002 amends the exceptions listed for
able bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD) in Section 6(0)(3)
of the Food and Nutrition Act to the SNAP work requirement. Spe-
cifically, this section would increase the age with which ABAWDs
must continue working to qualify for SNAP to 64 (up from 54 cur-
rently); it changes the generic, functional definition of ‘‘dependent
child’’ for ABAWD purposes from under 18 years of age to under
7; and it carves out an exception to the work requirements for a
person responsible for a child 7 years of age or older who is mar-
ried and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP
work requirements.
Subsection (b) of section 10002 keeps in place the October 1,
2030 sunset provision currently in law for the ABAWD exception
for: homeless individuals; veterans; and individuals who are 24
years of age or younger and who were in foster care under the re-
sponsibility of a State on the date of attaining 18 years of age or
such higher age as the State has elected under section 475(8)(B)(iii)
of the Social Security Act.
Sec. 10003. Able Bodied Adults Without Dependents Waivers.
Paragraph (1) of section 10003 amends Section 6(o)(4)(A) of the
Food and Nutrition Act—which addresses State waiver requests to

the work requirement for ABAWDs—by requiring county or county-
equivalents to have unemployment rates of over 10% to be eligible
for waivers, such waivers being valid for not more than 12 consecu-
tive months. Currently, the Secretary has wide discretion to issue
such waivers indefinitely across entire States if the Secretary de-
termines the area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.
Paragraph (2) of section 10003 amends Section 6(o)(6)(F) to lower
the maximum number of exempt ABAWDs not living in a waived
county or county-equivalent from the SNAP work requirement from
8 percent of such individuals in the State to 1 percent.
Sec. 10004. Availability of Standard Utility Allowances Based on
Receipt of Energy Assistance.
Subsection (a) of section 10004 amends Section 5(e)(6)(C)(iv)(I) of
the Food and Nutrition Act to limit the use of payments of $20 or
more from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981
(or similar energy assistance program) to automatically qualify for
the standard utility allowance in determining SNAP allotments to
only households with elderly or disabled members. Currently, all
households qualify.
Subsection (b)(l) of section 10004 amends Section 5(k)(4) of the
Food and Nutrition Act to limit the exclusion from income for the
purposes of determining SNAP allotments, payments made pursu-
ant to State law to provide energy assistance to a household to only
households with an elderly or disabled member. Subsection (b)(2)
amends Section 5(k)(4) of the Food and Nutrition Act to limit the
inclusion of expenses paid on behalf of a household under a State
law to provide energy assistance as ‘‘out-of-pocket’’ expenses to be
considered in the excess shelter deduction for purposes of deter-
mining SNAP allotments to only households with an elderly or dis-
abled member. Currently, all households enjoy those benefits.
Sec. 10005. Restrictions on Internet Expenses.
Section 10005 amends Section 5(e)(6) of the Food and Nutrition
Act by adding at the end a new subparagraph (E) that explicitly
forbids the use of household internet costs from being used in com-
puting the excess shelter expense deduction in determining the size
of household SNAP allotments.
Sec. 10006. Matching Funds Requirement.
Subsection (a) of section 10006 amends Section 4(a) of the Food
and Nutrition Act by adding a new paragraph (2). Paragraph (2)(A)
would require all States to contribute 5 percent of the cost of SNAP
allotments beginning in fiscal year 2028. Paragraph (2)(8) increases
the percentage that States must contribute based on each respec-
tive State’s SNAP error rate. States with error rates of between 6
and 8 percent must contribute 15 percent; States with error rates
of between 8 and 10 percent must contribute 20 percent; and States
with error rates equal to or greater than 10 percent must con-
tribute 25 percent.
Subsection (b) of section 10006 is a rule of construction meant to
add further clarity that in no event may the federal government
pay towards SNAP allotments an amount greater than the ‘‘Fed-

section (a)).
Sec. 10007. Administrative Cost Sharing.
Section 10007 amends Section 16(a) of the Food and Nutrition
Act by reducing the federal share of the cost of administering
SNAP from 50 percent to 25 percent, thereby increasing the State
share of administrative costs from 50 percent to 75 percent.
Sec. 10008. General Work Requirement Age.
Paragraph (I) of section 10008 amends Section 6(d)(1) of the Food
and Nutrition Act by changing the general SNAP work require-
ment age from over 15 and under 60, to over 17 and under 65.
Paragraph (2) amends Section 6(d)(2) by increasing the age of a
child for which a parent will be exempted from the general SNAP
work requirements from under the age of 6 to under the age of 7.
Sec. 10009. National Accuracy Clearinghouse.
Section 10009 amends Section 11(x)(2) of the Food and Nutrition
Act by adding at the end a new subparagraph (D) that would re-
quire state agencies to use indications of multiple issuances of
SNAP benefits to prevent multiple issuances of other federal and
State assistance program benefits.
Sec. 10010. Quality Control Zero Tolerance.
Section 10010 amends Section 16(c)(l)(A)(ii) of the Food and Nu-
trition Act by reducing the tolerance level for errors in SNAP from
$37 in 2014 dollars (adjusted annually to account for inflation) to
$0.
Sec. 10011. National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Pro-
gram Repealer.
Section 10011 repeals Section 28 of the Food and Nutrition Act:
The National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program.
Sec. 10012. Alien SNAP Eligibility.
Section 10012 amends Section 6(f) of the Food and Nutrition Act
to limit SNAP benefits to only individuals who reside in the United
States and are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United
States.
Sec. 10013. Emergency Food Assistance.
Section 10013 amends Section 203D(d)(5) of the Emergency Food
Assistance Act of 1983 to extend mandatory funding for each fiscal
year through 2031 to carry out federal projects aimed at reducing
food waste, providing food to individuals in need, and building rela-
tionships between agricultural production, processing, and distribu-
tion.

crop year, the reference price for all covered commodities above
shall equal the reference price in the previous crop year multiplied
by 1.005 and cannot exceed 115 percent of the reference price for
such covered commodity.
Section 10101(b) amends section 1112 of the Agricultural Act of
2014 to maintain all current base acres while providing a 1-time
allocation of new base for not more than an additional 30,000,000
base acres for producers who currently do not have base or whose
average planted and prevented plant acres exceed the current base
acres on the farm. Additionally, section 10101(b) requires a pro-
rated reduction by the Secretary if the total number of eligible
acres allocated to base acres across all farms in the U.S. would ex-
ceed 30,000,000 acres beginning in crop year 2026.
Section 10101(c) amends section 1115 of the Agricultural Act of
2014. The subsection requires producers to make an election to ob-
tain PLC or ARC coverage on a covered-commodity-by-covered-com-
modity basis through crop year 2031.
Section 10101(d) amends section 1116 of the Agricultural Act of
2014 to extend PLC through crop year 2031.
Section 10101(e) amends section 1117 of the Agricultural Act of
2014 to extend ARC through crop year 2031. The subsection also
increases the agricultural risk coverage guarantee to 90 percent of
the benchmark revenue for crop years 2025 through 2031. It fur-
ther increases the payment rate calculation to include 12.5 percent
of the benchmark revenue in crop years 2025 through 2031.
Section 10101(f) amends section 1001 of the Food Security Act of
1985 to define the term ‘‘qualified pass through entity’’ to include
partnerships, S-Corps, LLCs, joint ventures, and general partner-
ships. The subsection requires the Secretary to treat such entities
in the same manner as current law treats general partnerships and
joint ventures for the purposes of applying payment limitations.
Section 10101(g) amends section 1001 of the Food Security Act
of 1985 to increase the payment limitation for Title I payments
from $125,000 to $155,000, adjusted annually to account for infla-
tion based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of
Labor.
Section 10101(h) amends section 1001D(b) of the Food Security
Act of 1985 to provide an exception to the AGI means test for pur-
poses of determining eligibility for disaster and conservation pro-
grams if the person or entity derives more than 75 percent of their
average gross income from farming, ranching, and silviculture ac-
tivities. Farming, ranching, and silviculture activities include agri-
tourism, direct-to-consumer marketing of agricultural products, the
sale of agricultural equipment owned by an operation.
Section 10101(i) amends section 1202 of the Agricultural Act of
2014 to include, for crop years 2026 through 2031, modest in-
creases in loan rates for most loan commodities, while providing for
a more substantial increase in loan rates for commodities that did
not receive an increase in the Agricultural Improvement Act of
2018. Section 10101(i) also establishes a special rule for the effec-
tive price for PLC where the loan rate shall be equal to $0.30 per
pound for seed cotton and $3.30 per bushel for corn.

Section 10101(i) further amends section 1204(g) of the Agricul-
tural Act of 2014 to require the Secretary to make cotton storage
payments for upland cotton and extra-long staple cotton in the
same manner as provided in 2006 for upland cotton. The payment
rate shall be equal to the lesser of the submitted tariff rate for the
current marketing year and the maximum storage payment rate of
$4.90 for California and Arizona and $3.00 in all other states. The
subsection also enhances flexibility for loan redemption of upland
cotton and modernizes loan provisions for extra-long staple cotton.
Section 10101(j) amends section 1204 of the Agricultural Act of
2014 by establishing the repayment rate of a marketing assistance
loan for upland cotton to be the lowest prevailing world market
price during the 30-day period beginning on the date on which such
loan was repaid was used. Section 10101(j) also provides for a re-
fund of a marketing loan for upland cotton that is repaid by a pro-
ducer. Section 10101(j) further updates the formula for the pre-
vailing world market price for upland cotton to provide that, for
any period which price quotations for Middling (M) one and three-
thirty-second inch cotton are available, is based on the average of
the 3 lowest-priced growths that are quoted. Lastly, section
10101(j) establishes the repayment rate of a marketing assistance
loan for extra long staple cotton to be the lesser of the loan rate
established for the commodity or the prevailing world market price.
The prevailing world market price for extra long staple cotton shall
be adjusted to U.S. quality and location, as well as include the av-
erage costs to market the commodity taking into account transpor-
tation costs on the date the loan was repaid.
Section 10101(k) amends section 1207(c) of the Agricultural Act
of 2014. The subsection increases the Economic Adjustment Assist-
ance for Textile Mills payment rate from $0.03/lb. to $0.05/lb. of up-
land cotton used by the mill, beginning August 1, 2025.
Section 10101(l) provides various sugar program updates. Sub-
section (1)(1) amends section 156 of the Federal Agriculture Im-
provement and Reform Act of 1996 to increase, for crop years 2025
through 2031, the loan rate for sugarcane to $0.24 per pound. The
subsection further increases the loan rate for sugar beets to 136.55
percent of the loan rate for raw sugar.
Subsection (1)(2) amends section 167 of the Federal Agriculture
Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to increase for the 2025 crop
year and each subsequent crop year the storage payments to $0.34
per hundredweight per month for refined sugar and $0.27 per hun-
dredweight per month for raw cane sugar.
Subsection (1)(3) amends Section 359b(a)(1) of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act of 1938 to require the Secretary to provide sugar
estimates for flexible marketing allotments for sugar through crop
year 2031. The subsection also amends Section 359c(g)(2) of the Ag-
ricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to require the Secretary to give
priority to sugar beet processors that have sugar available, if the
Secretary makes an upward adjustment in an allotment.
Subsection (1)(4) amends section 359k of Agricultural Adjust-

Subsection (1)(5) amends section 359k(b)(1) of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act of 1938 to clarify that the Secretary has the au-
thority to take action to increase the supply of sugar before April
1st only if it is for the sole purpose of responding directly to an
emergency shortage of sugar in the United States market that is
caused by a war, flood, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or
other similar event.
Subsection (1)(6) amends Section 359l(a) of the Agricultural Ad-
justment Act of 1938 to extend the period of effectiveness for flexi-
ble marketing allotments for sugar through the 2031 crop year.
Section 10101(m) provides various dairy policy updates. Section

ernize their technology.
Subsection (p) amends section 1501 of the Agricultural Act of
2014 to provide various livestock safety net updates. Subsection
(p)(1) establishes a payment rate for predation losses at 100 per-
cent of the market value of the animal for losses caused by a feder-
ally protected species.
Subsection (p)(1) also establishes a payment rate for losses due
to adverse weather or disease at 75 percent of the market value of
the animal. The market value for both payment rates is determined
by the Secretary, who may consider the ability of eligible producers
to document regional price premiums for affected livestock that ex-
ceed the national average market price for those livestock. The
paragraph further establishes a supplemental payment for the loss
of unborn livestock incurred since January 1, 2024.
Subsection (p)(2) provides that an eligible livestock producer that

disaster program; or 2 monthly payments if for any of the 7 of the
8 consecutive weeks during the normal grazing period for the coun-
ty.
Subsection (p)(3) establishes that eligible producers on a farm of
farm-raised fish, including fish grown as food for human consump-
tion, shall be eligible to receive payments to aid in the reduction
of losses due to piscivorous birds. The payment rate for payments
shall be not less than $600 per acre of farm-raised fish.
Subsection (p)(4) decreases the threshold for producers to qualify
for the program to a tree mortality rate that exceeds normal mor-
tality. Additionally, the reimbursement rate increases from 50 per-
cent to 65 percent of the cost of pruning, removal, and other costs
incurred by an eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower to salvage
existing trees or, in the case of tree mortality, to prepare the land
to replant trees.
Subsection (q) provides that in determining honeybee colony
losses eligible for emergency assistance for livestock, honey bees,
and farm-raised fish under section 1501(d) of the Agricultural Act
of 2014, the Secretary shall utilize a normal mortality rate of 15
percent. Subsection (r) amends section 502(b) of the Federal Crop
Insurance Act to establish, among other criteria, that a beginning
farmer or rancher, and a veteran farmer or rancher, are farmers
or ranchers that have operated a farm or ranch for not more than
10 years.
Additionally, subsection (r) amends 508(e)(8) of the Federal Crop
Insurance Act to increase the crop insurance policy premium to
varying percentage points greater than premium assistance other-
wise available, depending on the reinsurance year that a beginning
farmer or rancher is in for an applicable policy or plan of insur-
ance.
Subsection (r)(2) amends Section 508(e)(2)(H)(i) of the Federal
Crop Insurance Act to provide that in the case of supplemental cov-
erage options, the amount shall be equal to the sum of 80 percent
of the additional premium associated with the coverage and the
premium calculated for the coverage to cover operating and admin-
istrative expenses.
Subsection (s) amends section 508(c)(4) of the Federal Crop In-
surance Act to enhance the coverage level for Whole Farm Revenue
Protection and certain area wide coverage options, as well as in-
creases the premium cost share the Corporation pays for the sup-
plemental coverage option.
Subsection (t) amends Section 508(e)(2) of the Federal Crop In-
surance Act to provide additional premium support in the cata-
strophic risk protection provided by the Corporation, with varying
degrees of support depending on the level of additional coverage of
the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at not greater
than 100 percent of the expected market price, or a comparable
coverage for a policy or plan of insurance that is not based on indi-
vidual yield.

and for each reinsurance year thereafter, in addition to the terms
and conditions of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement, to cover
additional expenses for loss adjustment procedures, the Corpora-
tion shall pay an additional administrative and operating expense
subsidy to approved insurance providers for eligible contracts, with
the payment to an approved insurance provider to 6 percent of the
net book premium.
Subsection (u) also establishes a reimbursement level for admin-
istrative and operating expenses with respect to specialty crop con-
tacts to be equal to or greater than the percent that is the greater
of 17 percent of the premium used to define loss ratio and the per-
cent of the premium used to define loss ratio that is otherwise ap-
plicable for the reinsurance year under the terms of the Standard
Reinsurance Agreement in effect for the reinsurance year.
Subsection (u) further requires the Corporation, beginning with
the 2026 reinsurance year and for each reinsurance year there-
after, to increase the total administrative and operating expense
reimbursements otherwise required under the Standard Reinsur-
ance Agreement in effect for the reinsurance year in order to ac-
count for inflation in a manner that is consistent with the increases
provided with respect to the 2011 through 2015 reinsurance years.
Subsection (v) amends section 515(1)(2) of the Federal Crop In-

DISSENTING VIEWS
May 16, 2025
We write to express our dismay over the partisan reconciliation
bill that was advanced out of the House Agriculture Committee on
a party-line vote the evening of May 14, 2025. The policies included
in the bill are backward and put our country on the wrong track.
Taking food assistance away from millions of American children,
seniors, veterans and people with disabilities to fund tax breaks for
the wealthy and large corporations will have long-term costs on the
country, both in terms of increasing the deficit and with regard to
diminishing opportunities for our nation’s children.
Furthermore, picking apart the farm bill—including some farm
policy in reconciliation while leaving the majority of the farm bill
behind—jeopardizes this year’s and future farm bills. The risk to
farm country cannot be overstated: successful farm bills rely on the
farm bill coalition to pass the House, the Senate and be signed into
law. This coalition is as broad and diverse as the farm bill itself
and splintering it without any consideration for future generations
of farmers does a great disservice to the farm families we represent
as members of the Agriculture Committee.
Dismantling Title IV of the farm bill with a $300 billion cut to
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) hurts ev-
eryone, particularly at a time when the cost of living is squeezing
every American and too many are just one paycheck away from dis-
aster. Seniors living on fixed incomes, parents struggling to afford
groceries for their children, people with disabilities and their care-
takers will all suffer when their food is taken away. We should
work together to make basic needs programs like SNAP work bet-
ter, not worse, for all Americans so they remain available when
people fall on hard times. These historic cuts to food assistance will
also hurt the farm and food economy, because when the people our
farmers feed cannot afford food, the farmers that grow our food sell
less. As currently written, these cuts will extract at least $30 bil-
lion from the farm economy.
This negative chain reaction will hurt hardworking people be-
yond farmers’ fields as well. Grocers, truckers, packaging and pro-
duction plant workers will lose income and jobs due to a drop in
food demand. As many as 27,000 retailers, largely in rural coun-
ties, are at the highest risk of shutting their doors due to the eco-
nomic impact of these cuts to critical food assistance for vulnerable
Americans.1
Hunger is a human condition, and cutting anti-hunger, basic
needs programs comes with a human cost. The specific policies
used to effectuate these cuts are so far-reaching and extreme that

no family currently receiving food assistance will be spared. Take,
for example, the estimated $155 billion cost shift to states proposed
in this bill.
Increasing the current administrative cost-shift for states to 75
percent and creating an unfunded mandate that attempts to force
states to pay for SNAP benefits will create a death spiral for fed-
eral food assistance in America. These new burdens will amount to
hundreds of millions—or billions—in demands on state budgets
that they will be simply unable to meet. State governments, par-
ticularly those with high poverty rates or smaller tax bases, which
are often more rural states, will have limited options to cover these
federally-mandated budget shortfalls: take food assistance away
from residents, raise taxes or slash other programs and services,
like funding for their departments of agriculture, veterans services,
programs for treating addiction, and even public schools or librar-
ies. The bill also alters how SNAP payment error rates are cal-
culated, which will cause state error rates to balloon, and their re-
quired cost-shift to increase significantly as a result, exacerbating
an already impossible scenario. The Majority’s bill creates systemic
rot within food assistance programs by defunding them, rather
than making them work better.
Furthermore, the bill adds more burdensome paperwork require-
ments that will take away food assistance from seniors and fami-
lies with children. Expanding these requirements to adults up to
age 64 means more seniors struggling to find work after losing
their jobs will not only lose work, but also their food assistance.
They arbitrarily reclassify which children are deemed ‘‘dependents’’
for the purposes of determining who receives SNAP benefits, re-
sulting in families with children losing their ability to purchase
healthy food. Current law uses standards that are instinctively rea-
sonable for most Americans. People under the age of 18 are consid-
ered dependent on their parents. Yet this bill decides that children
older than six are not dependent on their parents for food. This
does not reduce waste, fraud and abuse or improve program effi-
ciency—but it does take food away from an estimated 3 million peo-
ple to fund tax breaks for large corporations.
Of the many harmful policies included in this bill, another tar-
gets the Thrifty Food Plan. Essentially, the Majority requires that
food assistance only be adjusted for inflation, ignoring changing di-
etary guidelines, nutrition recommendations, causing benefits to
deteriorate over time. As time passes, SNAP benefits would become
impotent and ineffectual. The 2021 Thrifty Food Plan update, the
first of its kind in nearly 50 years, lifted 2.9 million people out of
poverty and had even stronger impacts in many rural states like
Alabama, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, due to the insufficiency of
benefits after waiting nearly five decades to do a true update.2 This
policy wages a war of attrition against SNAP, whittling away at its
purchasing power until whatever food assistance our nation’s hun-
gry children and seniors receive is too meager to fulfill the pro-
gram’s core function: helping vulnerable Americans meet their
basic need for food.

The Nutrition Title of the farm bill should be debated and im-
proved as part of the farm bill—a piece of legislation that failed to
reach the House floor for a vote last Congress due to a lack of sup-
port for a $30 billion cut to SNAP. This all-out assault on the title’s
food assistance programs in a partisan reconciliation process is a
flashing red light indicating that present and future farm bills are
in danger.
This bill leaves the majority of the farm bill behind. The last
farm bill marked up in the House Agriculture Committee was 800
pages long. This reconciliation bill is 97 pages short. It decimates
Title IV and, while it breaks off bits and pieces of other farm bill
titles, it falls woefully short of meeting the standard of being a seri-
ous piece of legislation that would uplift rural communities and
provide America’s farmers, ranchers, foresters and producers with
the long-term stability and regulatory certainty they need.
This bill includes nothing for rural development or the farm cred-
it system. It does nothing to provide U.S.-grown food commodities
with market opportunities through U.S. food aid programs. Nothing
in this bill helps address the wildfire crisis or improve forest
health; in fact, this bill takes us backward by including harmful re-
scissions to popular forest conservation programs. There is nothing
in this bill to help our energy independence by fostering renewable
fuels markets for farmers. Instead, the Majority cuts a full, five-
year farm bill off at the knees, extracting over $300 billion from
farm bill programs to fund tax breaks for the already rich.
This bill could have helped family farmers, the families they feed
and rural communities. The Majority had other priorities in mind.
The Majority’s reconciliation bill pits certain commodities against
others, and anti-hunger groups against farm groups. The Majority
could have brought everyone together—instead, they chose to ad-
vance a bill that further divides our country by favoring the
‘‘haves’’ at the expense of the ‘‘have-nots.’’ Bringing everyone back
to the table and rebuilding trust will take time. Rushing reckless
cuts to food assistance programs and busting up the farm bill coali-
tion demonstrates that the Majority prefers to spend its time on
other things. Rural communities and family farms will perish as a
result.
This is not the first time Democrats have warned our Republican
colleagues that the long-term consequences of these policies would
hurt struggling farmers, hardworking parents and children. We
have said it publicly and privately, numerous times. The Majority
has not listened. Instead, they chose to advance their partisan rec-
onciliation bill on May 14, 2025.
Democrats voted against the reconciliation bill in Committee. We
will vote against the larger bill, which, in addition to taking food
away from children and seniors, takes health care away from peo-
ple through $625 billion in Medicaid cuts, when it comes to the
House floor for a vote. We hope that between our markup and the
floor vote, a handful of brave Republicans will stand up and say,
‘‘Enough is enough,’’ and decide to work with Democrats to improve
basic needs programs instead of destroying them and, ultimately,
work with us in a bipartisan fashion on a full, five-year farm bill.
That is the only way that farmers and the rural communities in
which they live, Americans working throughout the food supply

COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the House of Represent-
atives, the committee adopts as its own the cost estimate prepared
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the House of
Representatives, the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional
Budget Office and submitted pursuant to section 402 of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 is as follows:
The legislation would:
• Appropriate $150 billion, primarily for military activities
of the Department of Defense (DoD)
• Modify authorities for privatizing military housing
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Expending funds appropriated for DoD’s military activities
Areas of significant uncertainty include:
• Anticipating the rate at which DoD and other agencies can
obligate the provided funds, which would affect the rate of out-
lays and amounts that could eventually be sequestered
• Estimating the number of new agreements for housing pri-
vatization
Legislation summary: H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution
on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, instructed the House Com-
mittee on Armed Services to recommend legislative changes that
would increase deficits up to a specified amount over the 2025–
2034 period. As part of the reconciliation process, the House Com-
mittee on Armed Services approved legislation on April 29, 2025,
that would increase deficits.
Estimated Federal cost: In CBO’s estimation, the reconciliation
recommendations of the House Committee on Armed Services

would increase deficits by $144.0 billion over the 2025–2034 period.
The estimated budgetary effects of the legislation are shown in
Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within budget functions
050 (national defense) and 700 (veterans benefits and services).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legis-
lation will be enacted in summer 2025. CBO’s estimates are rel-
ative to its January 2025 baseline and cover the period from 2025
through 2034. Outlays of appropriated amounts were estimated
using historical obligation and spending rates for similar programs.
Direct spending: Enacting this legislation would increase direct
spending by $144.0 billion over the 2025–2034 period. (see Table 2).
Almost all of that amount would result from specified direct appro-
priations for defense activities ($142.8 billion in outlays), with addi-
tional estimated amounts related to changes to military housing
privatization authorities ($1.2 billion in outlays).
Appropriated amounts: The legislation would appropriate $150.3
billion for 2025. Of that amount, almost all would be for the De-
partment of Defense (DoD), with the remainder for nuclear weap-
ons activities of the Department of Energy ($3.2 billion) and the
Armed Forces Retirement Home ($6 million). CBO expects that
amounts appropriated by this legislation would be subject to se-
questration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit
Control Act of 1985. CBO estimates that a portion of any unobli-
gated balances from those appropriations would be canceled in
2027, 2028, and 2029, which would reduce the budget authority
provided by this legislation. After adjusting for the effects of se-
questration, CBO estimates that, on net, specified budget authority
would total about $146.3 billion and outlays from that budget au-
thority would total $142.8 billion over the 2025–2034 period. The
following sections would appropriate specific amounts for the fol-
lowing purposes:
• Section 20002 would appropriate $33.8 billion for shipbuilding
programs, increasing outlays by $31.8 billion;
• Section 20003 would appropriate $24.7 billion for air and mis-
sile defense activities, increasing outlays by $23.5 billion;
• Section 20004 would provide $20.7 billion for the acquisition of
munitions and sustainment of the defense industrial base, increas-
ing outlays by $19.5 billion;
• Section 20005 would appropriate $13.5 billion to expedite the
delivery of low-cost weapons and capabilities, increasing outlays by
$13.0 billion;
• Section 20006 would appropriate $0.4 billion to improve the
audit readiness of DoD’s financial statements and for cybersecurity
programs, increasing outlays by $0.4 billion;
• Section 20007 would provide $7.3 billion for air superiority pro-
grams, increasing outlays by $6.8 billion;
• Section 20008 would provide $12.9 billion for improvements to
nuclear forces (of which $3.2 billion would be for the Department
of Energy), increasing outlays by $12.6 billion;
• Section 20009 would appropriate $11.1 billion to improve the
capabilities of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, increasing outlays
by $10.5 billion;
• Section 20010 would appropriate $11.5 billion to improve mili-
tary readiness, increasing outlays by $10.9 billion;
• Section 20011 would appropriate $5.0 billion for border secu-
rity activities, increasing outlays by $4.9 billion;
• Section 20012 would appropriate $2.0 billion for military intel-
ligence programs, increasing outlays by $1.9 billion;

• Section 20013 would appropriate $10 million for oversight ac-
tivities by the DoD Inspector General, increasing outlays by $9 mil-
lion; and
• Section 20001 would increase budget authority by $8.5 billion.
Of that amount, $7.3 billion would be specifically appropriated for
efforts to improve the quality of life for members of the armed
forces, increasing outlays by $6.9 billion.1 The remaining budget
authority and outlays in section 20001 would arise from changes to
housing privatization authorities, described in the next section.
Estimated Amounts: Section 20001 would modify authorities re-
lated to the privatization of military housing that CBO estimates
would increase direct spending by $1.2 billion over the 2025–2034
period.
To finance housing privatization projects, DoD typically enters
into long-term contracts with private-sector developers to renovate,
construct, operate, and maintain military housing. Those devel-
opers leverage DoD contributions, along with expected future Basic
Allowance for Housing (BAH) payments for military personnel, to
borrow additional capital to complete the projects.
CBO considers acquiring housing for military personnel in that
manner to be a governmental activity, and that amounts expended
by such public-private ventures should be recorded in the federal
budget as outlays at the time they occur. When proposed legislation
would affect transactions involving third-party financing of govern-
mental activities, CBO’s cost estimate for the legislation shows
budget authority for the full cost of the project at the time the
project is initiated. Outlays are shown over the construction period
for each project. In cost estimates, CBO classifies those cash flows
as direct spending.
Subsection 20001(b) would increase, through 2029, the limit on
the amount of funding that DoD can contribute to privatization
projects. Measured by the total capital costs of a project, the section
would raise DoD’s authorized contribution threshold from 33.3 per-
cent to 60 percent. CBO expects that providing additional funding
would facilitate DoD privatization projects that are not financially
viable under current law.
CBO estimates that extra funding would allow DoD to initiate
one additional privatized housing project by 2029. Based on the
cost of previous projects, CBO estimates that the new project would
cost $500 million. To account for the uncertainty regarding the tim-
ing of that project, CBO evenly distributed the estimated budget
authority over the 2026–2029 period. Thus, after accounting for the
time needed to complete the construction of the project, CBO esti-
mates that increasing the funding limit would increase direct
spending by $450 million over the 2025–2034 period.
Subsection 20001(c) would authorize DoD to pay higher rates of
BAH through 2029 to unaccompanied service members living in
military housing (such as barracks) provided under the Military
Housing Privatization Initiative. CBO expects that the increased
payments would facilitate DoD privatization projects that are not
financially viable under the current amounts for that allowance.
1The amounts appropriated by section 20001 include $6 million for the Armed Forces Retire-
ment Home, which falls under budget function 700 (veterans benefits and services).

CBO estimates that in each year from 2027 through 2029, DoD
would initiate one project for unaccompanied housing as a result of
the higher rates. Based on the cost of previous projects and adjust-
ing for inflation, CBO estimates that, on average, projects would
cost $270 million each. Accounting for the time necessary to com-
plete each project, CBO estimates that enacting the higher BAH
would increase direct spending by $780 million over the 2025–2034
period.
Uncertainty: Unobligated balances of appropriations provided by
this legislation would be subject to sequestration procedures. The
amount sequestered would depend on how quickly the agencies can
obligate the provided amounts. If obligation rates differ from CBO’s
estimates, the amount of balances canceled through sequestration
could be greater or less than estimated here.
In addition, the cost and number of the military housing privat-
ization projects arising from the temporary authorities in section
20001 could differ from CBO’s estimates.
Pay-As-You-Go Considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays that are subject to those pay-as-you-go proce-
dures are shown in Table 1.
Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits: CBO
estimates that enacting the legislation would not increase net di-
rect spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive
10-year periods beginning in 2035.
Mandates: The legislation contains no intergovernmental or pri-
vate-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act.
Estimate Prepared By: Federal Costs: Caroline Dorminey (for
Procurement); William Ma (for Operation and Maintenance, De-
fense Outlays); Christopher Mann (for Military Construction, Fam-
ily Housing); Aldo Prosperi (for National Defense Stockpile, Re-
search and Development); David Rafferty (for Military Retirement);
Dawn Sauter Regan (for Military and Civilian Personnel); Matt
Schmit (for Military Health System). Mandates: Brandon Lever.
Estimate Reviewed By: David Newman, Chief, Defense, Inter-
national Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs Cost Estimates Unit; Kath-
leen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; Chris-
tina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; H. Sam-
uel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; Chad Chirico,
Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate Approved By: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

DISSENTING VIEWS
There is clear bipartisan support among the members of this
committee for defense investments that support modernization,
readiness, innovation, and the quality of life of our service mem-
bers and their families. The ideal process for considering these in-
vestments is the normal authorization and appropriations process.
For over six decades, this committee has worked within this proc-
ess and proven again and again its ability to tackle the hardest and
most controversial issues of the day—and illustrated the value of
working across the aisle to solve the national security problems
that matter to the American people. Unfortunately, by rubber
stamping this proposed legislation and endorsing this folly, the
committee has roundly rejected its normal tradition of forceful and
bipartisan oversight.
There’s no question that the Department of Defense has require-
ments and that we as a country face threats and challenges from
around the world. We clearly need to meet those threats and chal-
lenges, and we need to do so in ways that promote efficiency and
effectiveness and allow for greater innovation. Unfortunately, it is
equally true that gifting the Pentagon an additional $150 billion
with few to no guardrails, on top of the nearly $900 billion in de-
fense authorizations and appropriations already passed, and with-
out receiving the President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2026 or even
the execution instructions for the Fiscal Year 2025 Continuing Res-
olution, defies basic common sense. Paying for it with a combina-
tion of debt borne by future generations and devastating cuts that
can only come from critical programs like Medicaid, the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program, and student loan and grant
programs at the Department of Education is unacceptable. Turning
around and giving this giant blank check to a Pentagon reeling
from the chaos inflicted by Secretary of Defense Hegseth, the irra-
tional and destructive actions of Elon Musk and his so-called De-
partment of Government Efficiency, and a President consumed only
with loyalty, is beyond foolish.
This committee has yet to receive even the most basic trans-
parency information from the Pentagon and the Trump Adminis-
tration about important matters within its jurisdiction, including
leaks of classified information and the chaos inflicted on the De-
partment of Defense and its employees by DOGE’s opaque and mis-
guided efforts. Rather than use this opportunity to fulfill our re-
sponsibilities, most of our Republican colleagues didn’t show up
during consideration of this legislation. None—except for the Chair-
man—spoke or engaged in the process in any meaningful way.
This legislation represents a failure of our responsibility as Mem-
bers of the committee entrusted with the immense responsibility of
careful and considered oversight of the Department of Defense. I
remain committed to working across the aisle to pass a responsible

budget and defense authorization that meet our national security
requirements, but we can and must do this without exploding the
deficit and debt while giving trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy and

with vanity and culture wars than with actual management and
leadership.

DISSENTING VIEWS
This reconciliation bill allocates an additional $150 billion to the
Department of Defense, supplementing the $849.9 billion already
authorized under the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act (NDAA). While I strongly support investing in our military
and national security, that investment must not come at the ex-
pense of hardworking American families. While there are portions
of this bill that I would support as submitted through the normal
process, I cannot support providing reconciliation funds by taking
food from school-aged children. Because of this, I am strongly op-
posed to the passage of the proposed reconciliation package.
Cutting essential programs like Medicare, SNAP, and Head
Start—which millions rely on—to fund wasteful defense initiatives
is reckless and short-sighted. These cuts will have devastating con-
sequences for our most vulnerable communities, undermining the
very foundations of economic security and opportunity that Ameri-
cans depend on. We must pursue a balanced approach to national
defense—one that strengthens our military while protecting critical
social safety nets.
In addition to the fundamental flaws, this legislation funds a lit-
any of wasteful programs, further exacerbating fiscal irrespon-
sibility in defense spending. The Sentinel program has spiraled
into an 81% cost overrun, reaching $140.9 billion, with no clear
strategic necessity. Meanwhile, Congress is allocating $2 billion for
the Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM–N)—a
system that is redundant to existing capabilities and, when com-
bined with Sentinel, heightens the risk of nuclear escalation with
our adversaries.
The excessive funding for the Golden Dome proposal is equally
troubling, raising serious concerns about effectiveness, cost, and
oversight. Despite the Department of Defense’s failure to provide
Congress with a plan or cost estimate, my Republican colleagues
are pushing for a $25 billion investment in a program with highly
questionable technical feasibility. Deploying space-based intercep-
tors under this initiative will fuel global instability, increasing ten-
sions with rival nations and further militarizing the space domain.
Rather than racing toward failure, we should be carefully evalu-
ating the strategic value, and risk, of these programs.
President Trump’s use of military aircraft for immigration en-
forcement is deeply alarming, potentially unconstitutional, and a
wasteful misuse of our military resources. Despite my formal re-
quests for the Department of Defense to halt these unjustified oper-
ations, the responses I have received have been insufficient in ad-
dressing my concerns. These military deportation flights transport
fewer migrants yet cost three times more than ICE’s civilian air-
craft. Allocating an additional $5 billion to the Department of De-

fense for ‘‘repatriation’’ efforts, as this legislation does, is unneces-
sary and fiscally irresponsible.
Legislation involving such massive expenditures must go through
Congress’s normal authorization and appropriations process. This
is especially critical when funding decisions threaten essential pro-
grams like healthcare and food assistance. The American people
deserve rigorous debate to ensure Congress responsibly balances
national security priorities with the needs of our citizens. Instead,
not only was this bill rushed through without debate, but many of
my Republican colleagues failed to show up.
We cannot continue to waste billions on ineffective programs and
political legacy projects while ignoring the real needs of the Amer-
ican people.
Sincerely,
JOHN GARAMENDI,
Member of Congress.

imbursement percentage of a non-completing student
cohort shall be determined based on the most recent

‘‘(C) NON-REPAYMENT LOAN BALANCE.—
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—For each award year, the Sec-
retary shall determine the non-repayment loan bal-
ance for such award year for each student cohort of an
institution of higher education by calculating the sum
of—
‘‘(I) for loans in such cohort, the difference be-
tween the total amount of payments due from all
borrowers on such loans during such year and the
total amount of payments made by all such bor-
rowers on such loans during such year; plus
‘‘(II) the total amount of interest waived, paid,
or otherwise not charged by the Secretary during
such year under the income-based repayment plan
described in section 455(q); plus
‘‘(III) the total amount of principal and interest
forgiven, cancelled, waived, discharged, repaid, or
otherwise reduced by the Secretary under any act
during such year that is not included in subclause
(II) and was not discharged or forgiven under sec-
tion 437(a), 428J, or section 455(m).

calculating the non-repayment loan balance of student
cohorts under this paragraph, the Secretary shall—
‘‘(I) for each qualifying student loan in a student
cohort that is included in another student cohort
because the student who borrowed such loan com-
pleted two or more programs of study during the
same award year, the sum of the amounts de-
scribed in subclauses (I) through (III) of clause (i)
for such qualifying student loan shall be divided
equally among each of the student cohorts in

standing principal balance of the consolida-

centage of the sum of the amounts described
in subclauses (I) through (III) of clause (i) for
the consolidation loan for such year that is
equal to the percentage of the consolidation
loan determined under item (aa).
‘‘(D) TOTAL PRICE.—With respect to a student who re-
ceived Federal financial assistance under this title and
who completes a program of study, the term ‘total price’
means the total amount, before Federal financial assist-
ance under this title was applied, a student was required
to pay to complete the program of study. A student’s total
price shall be calculated by the Secretary as the difference
between—
‘‘(i) the total amount of tuition and fees that were
charged to such student before the application of any
Federal financial assistance provided under this title;
minus
‘‘(ii) the total amount of grants and scholarships de-
scribed in section 480(i) awarded to such student from
non-Federal sources for such program of study.
‘‘(4) NOTIFICATION AND REMITTANCE.—Beginning with the
first award year for which reimbursements are required under
this subsection, and for each succeeding award year, the Sec-
retary shall—
‘‘(A) notify each institution of higher education of the
amounts and due dates of each annual reimbursement cal-
culated under paragraph (3) for each student cohort of the
institution within 30 days of calculating such amounts;

retary, in addition to such reimbursement, interest on such
reimbursement payment, at a rate that is the average rate
applicable to the loans in such student cohort.

fails to remit to the Secretary a reimbursement for a stu-
dent cohort as required under this subsection, plus interest
owed in under subparagraph (A), within 12 months of re-
ceiving notification from the Secretary in accordance with

LOANS FOR A PROGRAM OF STUDY.—The Secretary shall, upon
the request of an institution that voluntarily ceases to make
Federal Direct loans to students enrolled in a specific program
of study, reduce the amount of the annual reimbursement
owed by the institution for each student cohort associated with
such program by 50 percent if the institution assures the Sec-
retary that the institution will not make Federal Direct loans
to any student enrolled in such program of study (or any sub-
stantially similar program of study, as determined by the Sec-
retary) for a period of not less than 10 award years, beginning
with the first award year that begins after the date on which
the Secretary reduces such reimbursement.
‘‘(7) RESERVATION OF FUNDS FOR PROMISE GRANTS.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, the Secretary shall reserve

COMMITTEE VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Between federal, state, and local government support, taxpayers
are spending over a quarter of a trillion dollars annually on post-
secondary education. The Department of Education (ED or Depart-
ment) alone disburses roughly $100 billion in federal student aid
annually, essentially making it the largest consumer bank in the
United States. Investments of this magnitude should result in posi-
tive returns for students and taxpayers, yet that’s not the case. For
example, half of the $300 billion in Pell Grants ED will disburse
over the next decade will be to students who never graduate.1 Over
half of recent college graduates work in jobs that only require a
high school diploma.2 Unsurprisingly, students, families, and tax-
payers are questioning whether postsecondary education is worth
the cost.3
Rising Costs
In the two decades prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, published
tuition and fees increased an astounding 164 percent, nearly three
times faster than the rate of inflation. Such increases far outpace
the costs of medical services, child care, housing, and nearly every
other good or service in the economy.4 Since there has been no com-
mensurate increases in household income, paying for college has
become an increasingly difficult endeavor, with the share of Ameri-
cans’ expenditures put towards postsecondary education nearly
doubling between 1989 and 2019.5 Even after accounting for grants
and scholarships, the typical low-income family is still expected to
pay roughly a third of its household income for the annual cost of
an in-state public education.6
Rising costs are not to the result of inadequate government sup-
port, as taxpayer funding for postsecondary education is higher
today than at any point in the nation’s history. In fact, if tuition
revenue per student had simply risen at the rate of inflation over
the last two decades, expansions in financial aid would have re-
duced the average in-state public college student’s tuition bill to
zero.7 Rather, the overwhelming evidence suggests that colleges
have exploited the availability of generous government support to
charge outrageous prices for low-value degrees and fund wasteful
spending on campus. For example, a 2017 study by the New York
Federal Reserve found that colleges raise tuition by 60 cents for
each $1 increase in federal loan subsidies.8 Other studies have
found that the PLUS loan program, which provides effectively un-
limited federal loans to parents of undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents, has inflationary impacts on tuition as well; according to a

dollar for dollar.9 Simply put, colleges ‘‘capture’’ financial aid in the
form of higher prices, and those higher prices result in more tax-
payer spending on financial aid to try to fill the gap, only for that
financial aid to be captured, and so on and so forth.
Declining Returns
Rising costs would not be a problem if the benefits of postsec-
ondary education rose at the same rate. However, both graduation
rates and the college wage premium have been stagnant for two
decades.10 As a result of rising costs and stagnant outcomes, the
return on investment for postsecondary education has inevitably
declined. Research shows that a quarter of bachelor’s degree pro-
grams and 40 percent of master’s degree programs leave students
worse off than if they had not enrolled in college in the first
place.11 Moreover, far too many students do not graduate at all; ac-
cording to data from the Department, 40 percent of students never
complete their degree.12
Importantly, students aren’t the only party that suffers when en-
rolling in postsecondary education that doesn’t pay off; taxpayers
suffer as well. Students face higher unemployment rates, rely on
government safety net programs, and ultimately fail to repay their
loans—all of which impacts taxpayers. Despite ‘‘oversight’’ of post-
secondary education from states, accreditors, and ED, hundreds of
thousands of students will borrow for programs that leave them
worse off than if they had never enrolled in school in the first
place. Currently, federal student loans have essentially zero under-
writing when it comes to the cost and quality of the education stu-
dents are pursuing, and colleges, which receive all these dollars up-
front, have no incentive to change it. In turn, taxpayers are ex-
pected to recoup just 80 cents for every dollar lent to students and
parents, resulting in over a quarter-trillion dollars in losses over
the next decade alone.13
A Broken System
The repeated patching of this broken system has built up a hor-
rific Frankenstein that is increasingly problematic, politically con-
tentious, and difficult to fix. In the absence of congressional action,
the Biden-Harris administration attempted to spend $1 trillion in
taxpayer money on student loan bailouts while doing nothing to ad-
dress the underlying issues of student debt and college costs.14 As
a result, students are expected to borrow more and default at
greater rates than those taking out loans during the height of the
COVID–19 pandemic.15 Just one third of borrowers are actually
making payments on their loans as required, with the tens of mil-

lions of others being either delinquent, in default, or in limbo as
a result of this Democrat-created crisis.16
STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS
Through budget reconciliation, Republicans have an opportunity
to provide real, lasting solutions to the issues plaguing postsec-
ondary education while saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of
dollars in the process through policies focused on streamlining loan
repayment, simplifying student loan options, and strengthening ac-
countability to ensure that students and taxpayers get a return on
their investment in postsecondary education.
Streamlining Student Loan Repayment
Under current law, there are over 50 ways for borrowers to meet
their repayment obligations. This tangled web of repayment options
makes it difficult for schools and loan servicers to communicate op-
tions to borrowers, including those who stand to benefit the most
from certain borrower safety net options like income-driven repay-
ment (IDR) plans but often never enroll in such plans because they
are unable to navigate them effectively.17 Moreover, struggling bor-
rowers also are deterred from making payments under IDR in
many cases because their payments too often fail to cover their in-
terest, let alone reduce their balance by a meaningful amount,
leaving taxpayers to foot the bill when the borrower ultimately de-
faults. To reduce complexity and protect borrowers and taxpayers
from unaffordable debt, House Republicans are proposing to pare
back the maze of options and curb excess loan forgiveness windfalls
provided to those who don’t need them.
Repayment Plans
There are currently several different repayment plan options;
however, the most utilized plans fall into two categories: (1) fixed
repayment plans; and (2) IDR plans, which allow borrowers to
make payments based on their income rather than their debt and
provide forgiveness typically after 20 to 25 years even for payments
of $0. In 2023, the Biden administration created a new IDR plan—
dubbed the SAVE plan—that dramatically lowered monthly pay-
ments for all borrowers and decreased time to forgiveness for all
borrowers to as little as 10 years. Simply put, the SAVE repayment
plan effectively turned the student loan program into a backdoor
mechanism for providing ‘‘free’’ college. Importantly, several states
filed lawsuits seeking to block its implementation. Federal courts
have signaled that they not only see the ‘‘SAVE’’ plan as illegal but
also that other existing plans created by ED using the same statu-
tory authority are illegal as well, threatening to throw the entire
student loan repayment system into chaos and leaving the current
administration with few options.
In order to prevent this Democrat-created crisis from occurring
today or recurring in the future, the House reconciliation proposal
streamlines repayment options for current and new borrowers. Bor-

rowers enrolled in the IDR plans that are subject to the injunction
currently in place by the courts will be moved into the existing in-
come-based repayment plan that is authorized in the Higher Edu-
cation Act and will also have available to them all fixed repayment
options authorized in law as well as the new repayment assistance
plan described below. These reforms will ensure that current bor-
rowers maintain access to safety net programs in light of the pend-
ing court decision and will prevent any further disruptions for bor-
rowers going forward. For new borrowers, the proposal pairs down
repayment options to just two: a fixed ‘‘mortgage’’ style plan and
a ‘‘repayment assistance plan’’ that provides targeted relief to bor-
rowers in need by preventing ballooning balances, reducing pay-
ments for those with children, and eliminating marriage penalties
that exist under current plans. Taken together, the repayment re-
forms will vastly simplify student loan repayment to benefit both
borrowers and taxpayers.
Simplifying Student Loan Options
Overwhelming evidence suggests that colleges have exploited the
availability of generous taxpayer-backed loans to raise prices rath-
er than improve access and affordability. Recognizing this, House
Republicans are proposing reforms to streamline loan options to in-
crease simplicity and affordability for students and families, as well
as curtail the extent to which schools force students to borrow ex-
cessive amounts of debt that they will never be able to repay.
These reforms include sunsetting Grad PLUS Loans—which allow
graduate students to effectively borrow unlimited sums—as well as
subsidized loans provided to undergraduates. In doing so, the pro-
posal also replaces the outdated and arbitrary annual loan limits
currently in place under the Stafford program with flexible annual
loan limits that vary by students’ program of study, while also add-
ing reasonable aggregate limits. The House proposal also reins in
the predatory Parent PLUS program which, like Grad PLUS, has
no borrowing limits, by requiring that students maximize their bor-
rowing first before PLUS loans are made available to their parents,
as well as by placing a reasonable $50,000 aggregate cap on bor-
rowing per parent.
Accountability for Students and Taxpayers
While the reforms to loan limits and student loan repayment will
go a long way towards curtailing excessive government spending,
those reforms alone will not address the fact that hundreds of bil-
lions of taxpayer dollars flow to low-value institutions and pro-
grams each year, leaving both students and taxpayers worse for in-
vesting in them. Under the current system, thousands of students
enroll in programs that leave them financially worse off than if
they had never gone to college in the first place. The existence of
schools and programs like this, which give students a negative re-
turn on their investment, is the consequence of a lack of account-
ability for college costs and student outcomes.18 The House pro-
posal will ensure accountability for students, institutions, and ED

when it comes to the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars all
three parties benefit from.
Skin in the Game
The centerpiece of the House Republican proposal to lower the
cost of postsecondary education for students, families, and tax-
payers is the bipartisan notion that all institutions should have a
stake in their students’ success. To address the absence in under-
writing and accountability for taxpayer dollars, House Republicans
are proposing to hold colleges accountable for the outcomes of their
graduates, including through charging them a fee for the taxpayer
losses on the loans they disburse to students, as well as rewarding
schools for enrolling and graduating low-income students in high-
value programs with flexible block grant funding. Importantly, this
proposed new system will be phased in over the next decade, with
the first risk-sharing payments occurring no earlier than three
years after enactment. Further, with a sector neutral account-
ability system in place, the proposal peels back outdated and
flawed metrics like the 90/10 rule that artificially increase tuition
and punish institutions for enrolling low-income students in high-
quality programs, as well as other rules that are selectively applied
based on the tax status of the college. Taken together, the Com-
mittee Print’s institutional accountability provisions will change
the incentives for institutions, lower college costs, and yield finan-
cial returns for students, schools, and taxpayers alike.
Other Reforms
The House proposal also improves accountability for taxpayer
dollars with respect to students and the Department. To the
former, recognizing that half of Pell Grant recipients fail to grad-
uate, the proposal changes the definition of full-time student with
respect to the Pell Grant, requiring that students take the appro-
priate number of courses to allow them to graduate on-time in
order to receive their full award. The proposal also aligns Pell
Grant eligibility with the federal student loan program, requiring
that students must be enrolled at least half time (though calculated
over the entire year rather than semester) in order to receive their
Pell Grant. Importantly, the proposal uses the savings recovered
from these Pell eligibility changes to help shore up Pell Grant
funding over the next decade, which has an expected shortfall of
$87 billion by the end of fiscal year 2034. These reforms, along
with the supplemental funding, close nearly 80 percent of the
shortfall through 2034, and fully funds the Pell Grant program into
Fiscal Year 2027. Lastly, the Committee Print aligns postsecondary
education and the workforce by opening up Pell Grant eligibility to
high-quality, short-term credential programs, including non-tradi-
tional providers that operate outside of the accreditation system
but demonstrate strong outcomes.
With respect to the Department, the proposal repeals regulations
providing backdoor loan forgiveness put forth under President
Biden and ensures that no future Secretary has the opportunity to
transfer trillions of dollars of debt from those who borrowed to
hardworking taxpayers who did not.

COMMITTEE PRINT SUMMARY
There is bipartisan agreement that student loan debt is too high,
completion rates are too low, and far too many students are left
worse off after paying for postsecondary education than if they had
never enrolled in the first place. For too long, policymakers have
relied on patchwork ‘‘solutions’’ that exacerbate these problems
without addressing their root cause: the inflated cost of obtaining
a college degree. Fortunately, Committee Republicans are stepping
up to fix the underlying problem permanently through the Com-
mittee Print, which provides a comprehensive solution that will
lower college costs for students and families in the following ways:
• Strengthening accountability for students and taxpayers. It
is time to ensure accountability for the hundreds of billions of
taxpayer funds that flow to postsecondary education. Colleges
should have a stake in their students’ success and be respon-
sible for reimbursing taxpayers for a portion of their losses if
students don’t see financial value from enrolling in an institu-
tion and can’t repay.
» Students, families, and the federal government pay
tens, sometimes hundreds, of thousands of dollars in tui-
tion while many degrees offer students no additional value
but leave graduates with debt. Too many are left worse off
than if they never enrolled in the first place.
» The Committee Print requires colleges to have skin in
the game by paying a portion of their students’ unpaid
loans based on how much of a return on investment the
degree provided. Institutions that continue to saddle their
students with debt eventually face increasing penalties
and risk loss of access to federal student aid.
» The Committee Print reins in executive overreach by
preventing any future attempts at loan ‘‘forgiveness’’ and
repeals a range of burdensome and costly Biden-era regu-
lations.
» Additionally, Pell Grant reforms ensure Pell funds go
towards families and students in need while promoting
completion. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to
receive Pell. The Committee Print also closes loopholes
that allowed wealthy families with foreign income or large
amounts of assets to still receive Pell Grants. The Com-
mittee Print reinvests budgetary savings back into Pell to
keep the program sustainable.
• Streamlining student loan options. The reforms included in
the Committee Print protect taxpayers and increase simplicity
and affordability so students don’t borrow excessive debt they
can never repay. It is time to reform the loan program so that
students, institutions, and taxpayers can all benefit.
» For undergraduate students, the Committee Print has
a maximum cap of $50,000. For graduate students, it sun-
sets the harmful GradPLUS loans that allowed for un-
capped lending for programs that had little to no return on
investment. For the loans remaining for graduate stu-
dents, the Committee Print now implements maximum ag-

213
gregate student loan caps of $100,000 for graduate stu-
dents and $150,000 for professional students.
» The Committee Print sets annual limits of both un-
dergraduate and graduate loans to the median cost of the
program of study across the nation. This will put down-
ward pressure on program costs. Thus, the lifetime aggre-
gate limit for every student is $200,000.
» The Committee Print also puts a total cap of $50,000
on the predatory Parent PLUS loans and requires students
to borrow the maximum amount they can before their par-
ent takes out a loan on their behalf.
• Simplifying the student loan repayment. The student loan
repayment process has become bloated and too complex. The
Committee Print simplifies the loan repayment system to help
troubled borrowers repay loans without saddling taxpayers
with the burden of paying back the loans of wealthy borrowers.
» The Committee Print repeals President Biden’s im-
properly named ‘‘SAVE’’ repayment plan that would have
cost taxpayers $220 billion because it enabled little to no
actual repayment of loans.
» The Committee Print then streamlines the litany of
other repayment plans into two plans: a fixed repayment
plan (like a house mortgage) and an income-driven repay-
ment (IDR) plan to help lower-income borrowers in need.
» The Committee Print’s new IDR plan scales payments
up with income, includes a minimum monthly payment,
and prevents balances from always ballooning. This en-
sures that all borrowers, even those struggling, can make
payments.
» Current borrowers in limbo will be given clarity and
placed into one of the existing statutory income-based re-
payment plans. They then have the option to switch into
the new plan if they choose.

a formula that rewards colleges for strong earnings outcomes,
low tuition, and enrolling and graduating low-income students;
sets the maximum amount an institution can receive annually
at $5,000 per federal student aid recipient.
» Use of Funds. Provides flexibility to use funds to meet the
maximum price guarantee required under the program, as well
as other initiatives to improve college affordability, college ac-
cess, and student successes in ways that best suit the needs of
the institution and its students; requires institutions to report
and evaluate how funds are used and disseminate best prac-
tices based on those evaluations.
» Maximum Price Guarantee. Requires that, as a condition
of receiving PROMISE grants, institutions must provide pro-
spective students a guaranteed maximum total price for a
given program of study based on income and financial need
categories established by the Secretary; requires such guar-
antee to be for a minimum period of enrollment (up to six
years or the institution’s median time to completion, whichever
is less).

eral Pell Grant under subparagraph (A) who has (or whose
spouse or parent, as applicable based on whose informa-
tion is used under such subparagraph, has) foreign income
that would, if added to adjusted gross income, result in the
student no longer being eligible for such total maximum
Federal Pell Grant, shall not be provided a Federal Pell
Grant until the student aid administrator evaluates the
student’s FAFSA and makes a determination regarding
whether it is appropriate to make an adjustment under
section 479A(b)(1)(B)(v) to account for such foreign income
when determining the student’s eligibility for such total
maximum Federal Pell Grant.
(E) With respect to a student who is not eligible for the
total maximum Federal Pell Grant under subparagraph
(A) or a minimum Federal Pell Grant under subparagraph
(C), the Secretary shall subtract from the student or par-

twice the amount of the total maximum Federal Pell Grant
for such academic year.
ø(2)¿ (2)(A) LESS THAN FULL-TIME ENROLLMENT.—In any case
where a student is enrolled in an eligible program of an insti-
tution of higher education on less than a full-time basis (in-
cluding a student who attends an institution of higher edu-
cation on less than a half-time basis) during any academic
year, the amount of the Federal Pell Grant to which that stu-
dent is entitled shall be reduced in direct proportion to the de-
gree to which that student is not so enrolled on a full-time
basis, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, as pro-
vided in a schedule of reductions published by the Secretary
computed in accordance with this subpart. Such schedule of re-
ductions shall be published in the Federal Register in accord-
ance with section 482. Such reduced Federal Pell Grant for a
student enrolled on a less than full-time basis shall also apply
proportionally to students who are otherwise eligible to receive
the minimum Federal Pell Grant, if enrolled full-time.
(B) LESS THAN HALF-TIME ENROLLMENT.—Notwithstanding
subparagraph (A), a student who first receives a Federal Pell
Grant on or after July 1, 2025, shall not be eligible for an
award under this subsection for any academic year beginning
after such date in which the student is enrolled in an eligible
program of an institution of higher education on less than a
half-time basis. The Secretary shall update the schedule of re-
ductions described in subparagraph (A) in accordance with this
subparagraph, including for students receiving the minimum
Federal Pell Grant.
(3) AWARD MAY NOT EXCEED COST OF ATTENDANCE.—No Fed-
eral Pell Grant under this subpart shall exceed the cost of at-
tendance (as defined in section 472) at the institution at which
that student is in attendance. If, with respect to any student,
it is determined that the amount of a Federal Pell Grant for
that student exceeds the cost of attendance for that year, the
amount of the Federal Pell Grant shall be reduced until the
Federal Pell Grant does not exceed the cost of attendance at
such institution.
(4) STUDY ABROAD.—Notwithstanding any other provision of
this subpart, the Secretary shall allow the amount of the Fed-
eral Pell Grant to be exceeded for students participating in a
program of study abroad approved for credit by the institution
at which the student is enrolled when the reasonable costs of
such program are greater than the cost of attendance at the
student’s home institution, except that the amount of such
Federal Pell Grant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the max-
imum amount of a Federal Pell Grant for which a student is
eligible under paragraph (1) or (2) during such award year. If
the preceding sentence applies, the financial aid administrator
at the home institution may use the cost of the study abroad
program, rather than the home institution’s cost, to determine
the cost of attendance of the student.

undergraduate, a Federal Pell Grant in the amount for
which that student is eligible.
(B) ALTERNATIVE DISBURSEMENT.—Nothing in this sec-
tion shall be interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from
paying directly to students, in advance of the beginning of

same award year that are not otherwise fully covered by
the student’s Federal Pell Grant.
(B) In the case of a student receiving more than one
Federal Pell Grant in a single award year under subpara-
graph (A), the total amount of Federal Pell Grants award-
ed to such student for the award year may exceed the total
maximum Federal Pell Grant available for an award year.

termining a student’s duration limit under subsection
(d)(5).
(D) In any case where an eligible student is receiving a
Federal Pell Grant for a payment period that spans 2
award years, the Secretary shall allow the eligible institu-

signed, as it determines is most beneficial to students.

tled to have paid on his or her behalf for that period under any
State or private loan insurance program.
(iii) The holder of a loan with respect to which payments are
required to be made under this section shall be deemed to have

the applicable interest rate under this part, and
(iii) the Secretary determines that subsection (d) does
not make such statutory limitation inapplicable and that
such statutory limitation threatens to impede the carrying

and which is made during the period beginning on the 60th
day after the date of enactment of the Higher Education

mine the amount of the payment which he must make with re-
spect to that loan.

or to make a decision based on such evaluation and counseling
with respect to the dollar amount of any such loan.

essary to resume enrollment at the borrower’s next available

quire a borrower to repay a loan in less than 5 years un-
less the borrower, during the 6 months immediately pre-
ceding the start of the repayment period, specifically re-
quests that repayment be made over of a shorter period.

repayment amount paid over a fixed period of time,
not to exceed 10 years;

period of time, not to exceed 10 years;

mined in accordance with paragraph (1)(L)(i); and

ment plan that enables a borrower who has a partial
financial hardship to make a lower monthly payment

described in this clause shall not be available to a bor-
rower for a loan under section 428B made on behalf of
a dependent student or for a consolidation loan under

made on behalf of a dependent student.
(B) LENDER SELECTION OF OPTION IF BORROWER DOES

graph (A), the lender shall provide the borrower with a re-
payment plan described in subparagraph (A)(i).
(c) GUARANTY AGREEMENTS FOR REIMBURSING LOSSES.—
(1) AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS.—(A) The Sec-
retary may enter into a guaranty agreement with any guar-
anty agency, whereby the Secretary shall undertake to reim-
burse it, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary
may establish, with respect to losses (resulting from the de-
fault of the student borrower) on the unpaid balance of the
principal and accrued interest of any insured loan. The guar-
anty agency shall, be deemed to have a contractual right
against the United States, during the life of such loan, to re-
ceive reimbursement according to the provisions of this sub-
section. Upon receipt of an accurate and complete request by
a guaranty agency for reimbursement with respect to such
losses, the Secretary shall pay promptly and without adminis-
trative delay. Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this
paragraph and in paragraph (7), the amount to be paid a guar-
anty agency as reimbursement under this subsection shall be
equal to 100 percent of the amount expended by it in discharge
of its insurance obligation incurred under its loan insurance
program. A guaranty agency shall file a claim for reimburse-
ment with respect to losses under this subsection within 30
days after the guaranty agency discharges its insurance obliga-
tion on the loan.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)—
(i) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reimburse-
ment payments by the Secretary under this subsection ex-
ceeds 5 percent of the loans which are insured by such
guaranty agency under such program and which were in
repayment at the end of the preceding fiscal year, the
amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection
for such excess shall be equal to 85 percent of the amount
of such excess; and
(ii) if, for any fiscal year, the amount of such reimburse-
ment payments exceeds 9 percent of such loans, the
amount to be paid as reimbursement under this subsection
for such excess shall be equal to 75 percent of the amount
of such excess.
(C) For the purpose of this subsection, the amount of loans
of a guaranty agency which are in repayment shall be the
original principal amount of loans made by a lender which are
insured by such a guaranty agency reduced by—
(i) the amount the insurer has been required to pay to
discharge its insurance obligations under this part;
(ii) the original principal amount of loans insured by it
which have been fully repaid; and
(iii) the original principal amount insured on those loans
for which payment of the first installment of principal has

tion or such first installment need not be paid pursuant to
subsection (b)(1)(M) of this section.
(D) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in
the case of a loan made pursuant to a lender-of-last-resort pro-
gram, the Secretary shall apply the provisions of—
(i) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by sub-
stituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for ‘‘95 percent’’;
(ii) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for
‘‘85 percent’’; and
(iii) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’
for ‘‘75 percent’’.
(E) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in
the case of an outstanding loan transferred to a guaranty agen-
cy from another guaranty agency pursuant to a plan approved
by the Secretary in response to the insolvency of the latter
such guarantee agency, the Secretary shall apply the provision
of—
(i) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by sub-
stituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for ‘‘95 percent’’;
(ii) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting ‘‘90 percent’’ for
‘‘85 percent’’; and
(iii) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting ‘‘80 percent’’ for
‘‘75 percent’’.
(F)(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in
the case of exempt claims, the Secretary shall apply the provi-
sions of—
(I) the fourth sentence of subparagraph (A) by sub-
stituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for ‘‘95 percent’’;
(II) subparagraph (B)(i) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’ for
‘‘85 percent’’; and
(III) subparagraph (B)(ii) by substituting ‘‘100 percent’’
for ‘‘75 percent’’.
(ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this subparagraph, the term
‘‘exempt claims’’ means claims with respect to loans for which
it is determined that the borrower (or the student on whose be-
half a parent has borrowed), without the lender’s or the insti-
tution’s knowledge at the time the loan was made, provided
false or erroneous information or took actions that caused the
borrower or the student to be ineligible for all or a portion of
the loan or for interest benefits thereon.
(G) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the
Secretary shall exclude a loan made pursuant to a lender-of-
last-resort program when making reimbursement payment cal-
culations under subparagraphs (B) and (C).
(2) CONTENTS OF GUARANTY AGREEMENTS.—The guaranty
agreement—
(A) shall set forth such administrative and fiscal proce-
dures as may be necessary to protect the United States
from the risk of unreasonable loss thereunder, to ensure
proper and efficient administration of the loan insurance
program, and to assure that due diligence will be exercised
in the collection of loans insured under the program, in-

by the guaranty agency, length of the borrower’s edu-
cational program, or the borrower’s academic year in

(iv) the lender shall contact the borrower not less
often than once every 180 days during the period of

propriate supporting documentation related to the re-
quest, and
(ii) during such period interest shall accrue but not

maining after the guaranty agency with which the Secretary
has an agreement under this subsection has deducted from
such payments—
(i) a percentage amount equal to the complement of the
reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the
guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan;
and
(ii) an amount equal to 24 percent of such payments
for use in accordance with section 422B, except that—

charge under subclause (I) equal to 8.5 percent of the
outstanding principal and interest of such defaulted
loan; and

the entire amount charged under clause (i)(I) with respect
to each defaulted loan that is paid off with excess consoli-
dation proceeds.
(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B), the term ‘‘excess con-
solidation proceeds’’ means, with respect to any guaranty agen-
cy for any Federal fiscal year beginning on or after October 1,
2009, the proceeds of consolidation of defaulted loans under
this title that exceed 45 percent of the agency’s total collections
on defaulted loans in such Federal fiscal year.

ANCE.—(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(C), the amount to

anty agency begins to actively carry on a student loan in-
surance program which is subject to a guaranty agreement

ceeding fiscal years,

agency in discharge of its insurance obligation insured under

(C) The Secretary shall continuously monitor the operations
of those guaranty agencies to which the provisions of subpara-
graph (A) or (B) are applicable and revoke the application of
such subparagraph to any such guaranty agency which the
Secretary determines has not exercised reasonable prudence in
the administration of such program.
(8) ASSIGNMENT TO PROTECT FEDERAL FISCAL INTEREST.—If
the Secretary determines that the protection of the Federal fis-
cal interest so requires, a guaranty agency shall assign to the
Secretary any loan of which it is the holder and for which the
Secretary has made a payment pursuant to paragraph (1) of
this subsection.
(9) GUARANTY AGENCY RESERVE LEVEL.—(A) Each guaranty
agency which has entered into an agreement with the Sec-
retary pursuant to this subsection shall maintain in the agen-
cy’s Federal Student Loan Reserve Fund established under sec-
tion 422A a current minimum reserve level of at least 0.25 per-
cent of the total attributable amount of all outstanding loans
guaranteed by such agency. For purposes of this paragraph,
such total attributable amount does not include amounts of
outstanding loans transferred to the guaranty agency from an-
other guaranty agency pursuant to a plan of the Secretary in
response to the insolvency of the latter such guaranty agency.

tion from each guaranty agency having an agreement under
this subsection to enable the Secretary to evaluate the finan-
cial solvency of each such agency. The information collected
shall include the level of such agency’s current reserves, cash
disbursements and accounts receivable.
(C) If (i) any guaranty agency falls below the required min-
imum reserve level in any 2 consecutive years, (ii) any guar-
anty agency’s Federal reimbursement payments are reduced to
85 percent pursuant to paragraph (1)(B)(i), or (iii) the Sec-
retary determines that the administrative or financial condi-
tion of a guaranty agency jeopardizes such agency’s continued
ability to perform its responsibilities under its guaranty agree-
ment, then the Secretary shall require the guaranty agency to
submit and implement a management plan acceptable to the
Secretary within 45 working days of any such event.
(D)(i) If the Secretary is not seeking to terminate the guar-
anty agency’s agreement under subparagraph (E), or assuming
the guaranty agency’s functions under subparagraph (F), a
management plan described in subparagraph (C) shall include
the means by which the guaranty agency will improve its fi-
nancial and administrative condition to the required level
within 18 months.
(ii) If the Secretary is seeking to terminate the guaranty
agency’s agreement under subparagraph (E), or assuming the
guaranty agency’s functions under subparagraph (F), a man-

nancial condition;

essary to protect the Federal fiscal interest; or
(v) the Secretary determines that such action is nec-
essary to ensure the continued availability of loans to stu-

is terminated pursuant to subparagraph (E), then the Sec-
retary shall assume responsibility for all functions of the guar-
anty agency under the loan insurance program of such agency.

(i) permit the transfer of guarantees to another guaranty
agency;
(ii) revoke the reinsurance agreement of the guaranty
agency at a specified date, so as to require the merger,
consolidation, or termination of the guaranty agency;
(iii) transfer guarantees to the Department of Education
for the purpose of payment of such claims and process
such claims using the claims standards of the guaranty
agency, if such standards are determined by the Secretary

return, to the guaranty agency or the Secretary, of any
funds or assets provided by the guaranty agency, under
contract or otherwise, to any person or organization; or

sistent with the terms or purposes of this section; and
(iii) no provision of State law shall apply to the actions
of the Secretary in terminating the operations of a guar-
anty agency.

retary’s liability for any outstanding liabilities of a guaranty
agency (other than outstanding student loan guarantees under
this part), the functions of which the Secretary has assumed,
shall not exceed the fair market value of the reserves of the
guaranty agency, minus any necessary liquidation or other ad-
ministrative costs.
(I) The Secretary shall not take any action under subpara-
graph (E) or (F) without giving the guaranty agency notice and

cal year, shall submit to the authorizing committees a report

institution or an agency or instrumentality of the State (here-
after in this subsection referred to as the ‘‘lender’’) for the pur-
pose of authorizing disbursements of the proceeds of a loan to
a student. Such agreement shall provide that the lender will
pay the proceeds of such loans into an escrow account to be ad-
ministered by the escrow agent in accordance with the provi-
sions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such agreement may

ing into an agreement under paragraph (1) of this subsection

Federal Government or obligations which are insured or
guaranteed by the Federal Government;
(D) retain interest or other earnings on such investment;
and

dent ceases to carry at an eligible institution at least one-
half of the normal full-time academic workload as deter-
mined by the institution.
(j) LENDERS-OF-LAST-RESORT.—
(1) GENERAL REQUIREMENT.—In each State, the guaranty
agency or an eligible lender in the State described in section
435(d)(1)(D) of this Act shall, before July 1, 2010, make loans
directly, or through an agreement with an eligible lender or
lenders, to eligible students and parents who are otherwise un-
able to obtain loans under this part (except for consolidation
loans under section 428C) or who attend an institution of high-

borrower than the maximum interest rates, origination or de-
fault fees, or other terms and conditions applicable to that type
of loan under this part. The guaranty agency shall consider the
request of any eligible lender, as defined under section
435(d)(1)(A) of this Act, to serve as the lender-of-last-resort
pursuant to this subsection.
(2) RULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES.—The guaranty agen-
cy shall develop rules and operating procedures for the lender-
of-last-resort program designed to ensure that—
(A) the program establishes operating hours and meth-
ods of application designed to facilitate application by stu-
dents and ensure a response within 60 days after the stu-
dent’s original complete application is filed under this sub-
section;
(B) consistent with standards established by the Sec-
retary, students applying for loans under this subsection
shall not be subject to additional eligibility requirements
or requests for additional information beyond what is re-
quired under this title in order to receive a loan under this
part from an eligible lender, nor, in the case of students
and parents applying for loans under this subsection be-
cause of an inability to otherwise obtain loans under this
part (except for consolidation loans under section 428C), be
required to receive more than two rejections from eligible
lenders in order to obtain a loan under this subsection;
(C) information about the availability of loans under the
program is made available to institutions of higher edu-
cation in the State; and
(D) appropriate steps are taken to ensure that borrowers
receiving loans under the program are appropriately coun-
seled on their loan obligation.
(3) ADVANCES TO GUARANTY AGENCIES FOR LENDER-OF-LAST-
RESORT SERVICES.—(A) In order to ensure the availability of
loan capital, the Secretary is authorized to provide a guaranty
agency designated for a State with additional advance funds in
accordance with subparagraph (C) and section 422(c)(7), with
such restrictions on the use of such funds as are determined
appropriate by the Secretary, in order to ensure that the guar-
anty agency will make loans as the lender-of-last-resort. Such
agency shall make such loans in accordance with this sub-
section and the requirements of the Secretary.
(B) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, a guar-
anty agency serving as a lender-of-last-resort under this para-
graph shall be paid a fee, established by the Secretary, for
making such loans in lieu of interest and special allowance
subsidies, and shall be required to assign such loans to the
Secretary on demand. Upon such assignment, the portion of
the advance represented by the loans assigned shall be consid-
ered repaid by such guaranty agency.
(C) The Secretary shall exercise the authority described in
subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that eligible
borrowers are seeking and are unable to obtain loans under

graph (4), and that the guaranty agency designated for that
State has the capability to provide lender-of-last-resort loans in
a timely manner, in accordance with the guaranty agency’s ob-
ligations under paragraph (1), but cannot do so without ad-
vances provided by the Secretary under this paragraph. If the
Secretary makes the determinations described in the preceding
sentence and determines that it would be cost-effective to do
so, the Secretary may provide advances under this paragraph
to such guaranty agency. If the Secretary determines that such
guaranty agency does not have such capability, or will not pro-
vide such loans in a timely fashion, the Secretary may provide
such advances to enable another guaranty agency, that the
Secretary determines to have such capability, to make lender-
of-last-resort loans to eligible borrowers in that State who are
experiencing loan access problems or to eligible borrowers who
attend an institution in the State that is designated under
paragraph (4).
(4) INSTITUTION-WIDE STUDENT QUALIFICATION.—Upon the re-
quest of an institution of higher education and pursuant to
standards developed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall des-
ignate such institution for participation in the lender-of-last-re-
sort program under this paragraph. If the Secretary designates
an institution under this paragraph, the guaranty agency des-
ignated for the State in which the institution is located shall
make loans, in the same manner as such loans are made under
paragraph (1), to students and parent borrowers of the des-
ignated institution, regardless of whether the students or par-
ent borrowers are otherwise unable to obtain loans under this
part (other than a consolidation loan under section 428C).
(5) STANDARDS DEVELOPED BY THE SECRETARY.—In devel-
oping standards with respect to paragraph (4), the Secretary
may require—
(A) an institution of higher education to demonstrate
that, despite due diligence on the part of the institution,
the institution has been unable to secure the commitment
of eligible lenders willing to make loans under this part to
a significant number of students attending the institution;
(B) that, prior to making a request under such para-
graph for designation for participation in the lender-of-
last-resort program, an institution of higher education
shall demonstrate that the institution has met a minimum
threshold, as determined by the Secretary, for the number
or percentage of students at such institution who have re-
ceived rejections from eligible lenders for loans under this
part; and
(C) any other standards and guidelines the Secretary de-
termines to be appropriate.

under paragraph (4) to designate institutions of higher edu-
cation for participation in the program under this subsection

enactment of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans
Act of 2008.
(8) PROHIBITION ON INDUCEMENTS AND MARKETING.—Each
guaranty agency or eligible lender that serves as a lender-of-
last-resort under this subsection—

contained in subsection (b)(3) and the requirements of sec-
tion 435(d)(5); and
(B) shall not advertise, market, or otherwise promote
loans under this subsection, except that nothing in this
paragraph shall prohibit a guaranty agency from fulfilling

(C) NON-REPAYMENT LOAN BALANCE.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—For each award year, the Secretary
shall determine the non-repayment loan balance for
such award year for each student cohort of an institu-
tion of higher education by calculating the sum of—
(I) for loans in such cohort, the difference be-
tween the total amount of payments due from all
borrowers on such loans during such year and the
total amount of payments made by all such bor-
rowers on such loans during such year; plus
(II) the total amount of interest waived, paid, or
otherwise not charged by the Secretary during
such year under the income-based repayment plan
described in section 455(q); plus
(III) the total amount of principal and interest
forgiven, cancelled, waived, discharged, repaid, or
otherwise reduced by the Secretary under any act
during such year that is not included in subclause
(II) and was not discharged or forgiven under sec-
tion 437(a), 428J, or section 455(m).
(ii) SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.—For the purpose of
calculating the non-repayment loan balance of student
cohorts under this paragraph, the Secretary shall—
(I) for each qualifying student loan in a student
cohort that is included in another student cohort
because the student who borrowed such loan com-
pleted two or more programs of study during the
same award year, the sum of the amounts de-
scribed in subclauses (I) through (III) of clause (i)
for such qualifying student loan shall be divided
equally among each of the student cohorts in
which such loan is included; and
(II) for each consolidation loan in a student co-
hort—
(aa) determine the percentage of the out-
standing principal balance of the consolida-
tion loan attributable to such student cohort—

cluded in such cohort, in the case of a
loan consolidated before inclusion in such
cohort; or
(BB) at the time of consolidation, in the
case of a loan consolidated after inclusion
in such cohort; and

pletes a program of study, the term ‘‘total price’’ means the
total amount, before Federal financial assistance under this
title was applied, a student was required to pay to complete
the program of study. A student’s total price shall be cal-
culated by the Secretary as the difference between—
(i) the total amount of tuition and fees that were
charged to such student before the application of any
Federal financial assistance provided under this title;

addition to such reimbursement, interest on such reim-
bursement payment, at a rate that is the average rate appli-
cable to the loans in such student cohort.
(B) TWELVE-MONTH DELINQUENCY.—If an institution fails
to remit to the Secretary a reimbursement for a student co-
hort as required under this subsection, plus interest owed
in under subparagraph (A), within 12 months of receiving

the request of an institution that voluntarily ceases to make
Federal Direct loans to students enrolled in a specific program
of study, reduce the amount of the annual reimbursement owed
by the institution for each student cohort associated with such
program by 50 percent if the institution assures the Secretary
that the institution will not make Federal Direct loans to any
student enrolled in such program of study (or any substantially
similar program of study, as determined by the Secretary) for
a period of not less than 10 award years, beginning with the
first award year that begins after the date on which the Sec-
retary reduces such reimbursement.
(7) RESERVATION OF FUNDS FOR PROMISE GRANTS.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, the Secretary shall reserve
the funds remitted to the Secretary as reimbursements in ac-

Returns and return information (as defined in section 6103 of

priate repayment schedule.

ø(5) CALCULATION OF BALANCE DUE.—The balance due on a

regulations limiting the amount of interest that may be cap-
italized on such loan, and the timing of any such capitalization.
ø(6) NOTIFICATION TO BORROWERS.—The Secretary shall es-
tablish procedures under which a borrower of a loan made

cumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or
the borrower’s spouse, warrant an adjustment in the bor-
rower’s loan repayment, the borrower may contact the Sec-
retary, who shall determine whether such adjustment is appro-
priate, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary.

(e) FORBEARANCE.—(1) The Secretary shall ensure that, as docu-
mented in accordance with paragraph (2), an institution of higher

ify for forbearance for other reasons; or
(C) the borrower is eligible for interest payments to be made

(f) SPECIAL REPAYMENT RULE AUTHORITY.—(1) Subject to such re-
strictions as the Secretary may prescribe to protect the interest of
the United States, in order to encourage repayment of loans made
under this part which are in default, the Secretary may, in the
agreement entered into under this part, authorize an institution of
higher education to compromise on the repayment of such de-
faulted loans in accordance with paragraph (2). The Federal share
of the compromise repayment shall bear the same relation to the
institution’s share of such compromise repayment as the Federal
capital contribution to the institution’s loan fund under this part
bears to the institution’s capital contribution to such fund.
(2) No compromise repayment of a defaulted loan as authorized
by paragraph (1) may be made unless the student borrower pays—
(A) 90 percent of the loan under this part;
(B) the interest due on such loan; and
(C) any collection fees due on such loan;
in a lump sum payment.
(g) DISCHARGE.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—If a student borrower who received a loan
made under this part on or after January 1, 1986, is unable
to complete the program in which such student is enrolled due
to the closure of the institution, then the Secretary shall dis-
charge the borrower’s liability on the loan (including the inter-
est and collection fees) and shall subsequently pursue any
claim available to such borrower against the institution and
the institution’s affiliates and principals, or settle the loan obli-
gation pursuant to the financial responsibility standards de-
scribed in section 498(c).
(2) ASSIGNMENT.—A borrower whose loan has been dis-
charged pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to have
assigned to the United States the right to a loan refund in an
amount that does not exceed the amount discharged against
the institution and the institution’s affiliates and principals.
(3) ELIGIBILITY FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE.—The period
during which a student was unable to complete a course of
study due to the closing of the institution shall not be consid-
ered for purposes of calculating the student’s period of eligi-
bility for additional assistance under this title.
(4) SPECIAL RULE.—A borrower whose loan has been dis-
charged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded, be-
cause of that discharge, from receiving additional grant, loan,
or work assistance under this title for which the borrower
would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on the dis-
charged loan). The amount discharged under this subsection
shall be treated as an amount canceled under section 465(a).
(5) REPORTING.—The Secretary or institution, as the case
may be, shall report to consumer reporting agencies with re-
spect to loans that have been discharged pursuant to this sub-
section.
(h) REHABILITATION OF LOANS.—

loan, as determined by the institution, or by the Secretary
in the case of a loan held by the Secretary, the loan shall
be considered rehabilitated, and the institution that made
that loan (or the Secretary, in the case of a loan held by
the Secretary) shall request that any consumer reporting
agency to which the default was reported remove the de-
fault from the borrower’s credit history.
(B) COMPARABLE CONDITIONS.—As long as the borrower
continues to make scheduled repayments on a loan reha-
bilitated under this paragraph, the rehabilitated loan shall
be subject to the same terms and conditions, and qualify
for the same benefits and privileges, as other loans made
under this part.
(C) ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE.—The borrower of a rehabili-
tated loan shall not be precluded by section 484 from re-
ceiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under
this title (for which the borrower is otherwise eligible) on
the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such rehabilita-
tion.
(D) LIMITATIONS.—A borrower only øonce¿ twice may ob-
tain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to rehabili-
tating a loan under this part.
(2) RESTORATION OF ELIGIBILITY.—If the borrower of a loan
made under this part who has defaulted on that loan makes
6 ontime, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on
such loan, the borrower’s eligibility for grant, loan, or work as-
sistance under this title shall be restored to the extent that the
borrower is otherwise eligible. A borrower only once may ob-
tain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to restored eligi-
bility.
(i) INCENTIVE REPAYMENT PROGRAM.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Each institution of higher education may
establish, with the approval of the Secretary, an incentive re-
payment program designed to reduce default and to replenish
student loan funds established under this part. Each such in-
centive repayment program may—
(A) offer a reduction of the interest rate on a loan on
which the borrower has made 48 consecutive, monthly re-
payments, but in no event may the rate be reduced by
more than 1 percent;
(B) provide for a discount on the balance owed on a loan
on which the borrower pays the principal and interest in
full prior to the end of the applicable repayment period,
but in no event may the discount exceed 5 percent of the
unpaid principal balance due on the loan at the time the
early repayment is made; and
(C) include such other incentive repayment options as
the institution determines will carry out the objectives of
this subsection.
(2) LIMITATION.—No incentive repayment option under an in-
centive repayment program authorized by this subsection may
be paid for with Federal funds, including any Federal funds
from the student loan fund, or with institutional funds from
the student loan fund.

to conduct such verification.

penalty, or other regulatory action against an institution of higher
education with respect to any error in the institution’s determina-

based on citizenship or immigration status—
(1) if the institution has provided such eligibility based on a
verification of satisfactory immigration status by the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service,
(2) because the institution, under subsection (g)(4)(A)(i), was
required to provide a reasonable opportunity to submit docu-
mentation, or

required to wait for the response of the Immigration and Natu-

unsatisfactory immigration status, the individual is not eligible
for the loan,

under the loan, but such guaranty shall not be voided or otherwise
nullified with respect to such payments made before the date the
entity receives the notice.

ment period or period of enrollment.

bursement (as required in regulations prescribed by the

then the institution shall note that the institution enrolled too
few of such students to so disclose or report with confidence
and confidentiality.

ble institution shall designate an employee or group of employees
who shall be available on a full-time basis to assist students or po-
tential students in obtaining information as specified in subsection
(a). The Secretary may, by regulation, waive the requirement that
an employee or employees be available on a full-time basis for car-
rying out responsibilities required under this section whenever an
institution in which the total enrollment, or the portion of the en-
rollment participating in programs under this title at that institu-
tion, is too small to necessitate such employee or employees being
available on a full-time basis. No such waiver may include permis-
sion to exempt any such institution from designating a specific in-
dividual or a group of individuals to carry out the provisions of this
section.
(d) DEPARTMENTAL PUBLICATION OF DESCRIPTIONS OF ASSISTANCE
PROGRAMS.—(1) The Secretary shall make available to eligible in-
stitutions, eligible lenders, and secondary schools descriptions of
Federal student assistance programs including the rights and re-
sponsibilities of student and institutional participants, in order to
(A) assist students in gaining information through institutional
sources, and (B) assist institutions in carrying out the provisions
of this section, so that individual and institutional participants will
be fully aware of their rights and responsibilities under such pro-
grams. In particular, such information shall include information to
enable students and prospective students to assess the debt burden
and monthly and total repayment obligations that will be incurred
as a result of receiving loans of varying amounts under this title.
Such information shall also include information on the various pay-
ment options available for student loans, including income-sen-
sitive and income-based repayment plans for loans made, insured,

partmental publications.
(3) The Secretary, to the extent practicable, shall update the De-
partment’s Internet site to include direct links to databases that
contain information on public and private financial assistance pro-
grams. The Secretary shall only provide direct links to databases
that can be accessed without charge and shall make reasonable ef-
forts to verify that the databases included in a direct link are not
providing fraudulent information. The Secretary shall prominently
display adjacent to any such direct link a disclaimer indicating that
a direct link to a database does not constitute an endorsement or
recommendation of the database, the provider of the database, or
any services or products of such provider. The Secretary shall pro-
vide additional direct links to information resources from which
students may obtain information about fraudulent and deceptive
practices in the provision of services related to student financial
aid.
(4) The Secretary shall widely publicize the location of the infor-
mation described in paragraph (1) among the public, eligible insti-
tutions, and eligible lenders, and promote the use of such informa-

paragraph (1). If the institution is a member of a national colle-
giate athletic association that compiles graduation rate data on be-
half of the association’s member institutions that the Secretary de-
termines is substantially comparable to the information described
in paragraph (1), the distribution of the compilation of such data
to all secondary schools in the United States shall fulfill the re-
sponsibility of the institution to provide information to a prospec-
tive student athlete’s guidance counselor and coach.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, institutions may—
(A) exclude from the reporting requirements under para-
graphs (1) and (2) the completion or graduation rates of
students and student athletes who leave school to serve in
the Armed Forces, on official church missions, or with a
recognized foreign aid service of the Federal Government;
or
(B) in cases where the students described in subpara-
graph (A) represent 20 percent or more of the certificate-
or degree-seeking, full-time, undergraduate students at the
institution, calculate the completion or graduation rates of
such students by excluding from the calculations described
in paragraph (1) the time period during which such stu-
dents were not enrolled due to their service in the Armed
Forces, on official church missions, or with a recognized
foreign aid service of the Federal Government.
(4) Each institution of higher education described in paragraph
(1) may provide supplemental information to students and the Sec-
retary showing the completion or graduation rate when such com-
pletion or graduation rate includes students transferring into and
out of such institution.
(5) The Secretary, using the reports submitted under this sub-
section, shall compile and publish a report containing the informa-
tion required under paragraph (1) broken down by—
(A) individual institutions of higher education; and
(B) athletic conferences recognized by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association and the National Association of Intercolle-
giate Athletics.
(6) The Secretary shall waive the requirements of this subsection
for any institution of higher education that is a member of an ath-
letic association or athletic conference that has voluntarily pub-
lished completion or graduation rate data or has agreed to publish
data that, in the opinion of the Secretary, is substantially com-
parable to the information required under this subsection.
(7) The Secretary, in conjunction with the National Junior Col-
lege Athletic Association, shall develop and obtain data on comple-
tion or graduation rates from two-year colleges that award athlet-
ically related student aid. Such data shall, to the extent prac-
ticable, be consistent with the reporting requirements set forth in
this section.
(8) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘athletically related
student aid’’ means any scholarship, grant, or other form of finan-
cial assistance the terms of which require the recipient to partici-
pate in a program of intercollegiate athletics at an institution of
higher education in order to be eligible to receive such assistance.

determining the amount of such penalty, or the amount agreed
upon in compromise, the appropriateness of the penalty to the size
of the institution of higher education subject to the determination,
and the gravity of the violation, failure, or misrepresentation shall
be considered. The amount of such penalty, when finally deter-
mined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted

charged.

MINORITY VIEWS
INTRODUCTION
Committee Democrats firmly believe the Republicans plan in the
Committee Print of H. Con. Res. 141 will lower the quality of high-
er education and make higher education more expensive for stu-
dents. The Majority’s plans will weaken the Direct Loan program
and eliminate the PLUS Loan program, which will make it harder
for some students to afford a college degree, and impossible for oth-
ers. It creates new repayment options that are less generous then
current law, at a time that we know borrowers are struggling to
repay their loans. Finally, the bill dismantles key portions of the
higher education accountability framework to protect students and
taxpayers from waste, fraud, and abuse without proposing a viable
alternative framework. The Committee Print will have a net-nega-
tive impact on both students and institutions of higher education.
BACKGROUND ON THE RISING COST OF COLLEGE AND THE FLAWED
CONSIDERATION OF THE COMMITTEE PRINT
The value of a college degree cannot be understated. Research
has consistently found that a college degree confers significant fi-
nancial and non-financial returns, particularly for low-income stu-
dents and students of color.2 Typically, people with bachelor’s de-
grees make over $1 million more than high school graduates over
their lifetimes.3
But as the cost of obtaining a degree has risen sharply over the
last three decades, apprehension about the value of college has
risen as well. From 1990 to 2019, the net cost of attendance has
grown 81 percent at public four-year colleges, 33 percent at private
nonprofit colleges, and 19 percent at public two-year colleges.4 The
cost of college has significantly outpaced inflation, and many Amer-
icans’ ability to afford a college education has declined.5 And the
Pell Grant has not grown sufficiently to keep pace with increases
in tuition and fees. The Pell Grant now covers the smallest share
of college costs in four decades.6 Further, state investment in high-
1Through the report, the legislative text marked up by the Committee will be referred to as
the ‘‘Committee Print.’’ The reconciliation process requires all committees to mark-up up distinct
portions of an unintroduced bill and at time of markup, they are referred to as the ‘‘Committee
Print’’.

er education has declined over the decades.7 Students are forced to
make up that difference; to cover the remaining costs of college,
low-income students are taking out loans at higher rates than their
high-income peers and graduating with higher debt loads.
In order to support students in achieving their higher education
goals, the federal government has a responsibility to invest in high-
er education and help ensure the higher education system is
strong. However, the House Majority, along with the Trump Ad-
ministration, are destabilizing the U.S. higher education system
and making more difficult for students to afford a college edu-
cation. In its first 100 days, the Trump administration has abrupt-
ly defunded billions of dollars in university research, snatched
funds back from institutions without official findings of wrong-
doing, issued an executive order designed to give the federal gov-
ernment more control over what schools teach, and temporarily cut
off access to income-based repayment options for borrowers.8 It has
done all this while attempting to dismantle the Department of
Education, a which will cause confusion to students, student loan
borrowers, and colleges.9 Meanwhile, House Republicans are seek-
ing to advance policies via the Budget Reconciliation process that
will make it even harder for institutions to deliver quality edu-
cation, for students to afford higher education, and for the federal
government to provide oversight of the federal student aid pro-
gram. The over $300 billion in savings achieved in this bill is not
being used to shore up this higher education system in other ways.
It will be used to finance the trillions of dollars in tax cuts for bil-
lionaires.
THE COMMITTEE PRINT DECREASES COLLEGE ACCESS AND MAKES
COLLEGE LESS AFFORDABLE
The Majority proposes a package of damaging policies that will
create a bleak landscape for college access and affordability. Com-
mittee Democrats are deeply concerned the proposed changes to
federal student aid will collectively limit access to a range of pro-
grams of study for low-income students, steer students into the pri-
vate loan market, and make it harder for borrowers to pay off their
loans, all in direct opposition to the goals that drove the creation
of the Higher Education Act.

Capping Aid at the Median Cost of College
The Committee Print caps the total amount of federal student
aid that any student can receive at the median cost of attendance
for a student enrolled in a similar program of study, based on na-
tional data. The stated intent of this policy is to encourage institu-
tions of higher education to lower their tuition prices; however,
Committee Democrats are not aware of any research that signals
this policy is an appropriate approach to lower college costs. As a
threshold matter, capping aid at the median cost of attendance
would mean 50 percent of students who rely on federal student aid
would not receive enough federal aid to cover the cost of their pro-
gram. Higher education advocates rightfully argue this will create
a harmful funding gap that impacts students’ ability to cover the
basics needs components of their cost of attendance, such as hous-
ing and transportation and will be detrimental to students’ ability
to obtain their degree.10 Further, by using nationwide averages to
cap costs, students attending school in high cost of living areas will
be disproportionately impacted. Although Committee Republicans
believe this aid cap will incentivize institutions to lower their
prices, Committee Democrats believe this unfounded, one-size-fits-
all approach does not take into consideration variables across the
higher education system. When coupled with provisions limiting
the Secretary’s ability to regulate discussed later in these views,
this provision would sew chaos throughout higher education by dis-
couraging students from entering school to begin with or drive
them into the private loan market.
Pell Grants
The Majority’s proposal would weaken the Pell Grant program—
the cornerstone of federal student aid. Despite the declining pur-
chasing power of the Pell Grant, it remains a powerful tool that
unlocks significant additional financial support for low-income stu-
dents in higher education.11
In recent years, Congress, led by Committee Democrats, has se-
cured historic improvements to the Pell Grant, including laws that
resulted in approximately 610,000 more Pell Grant recipients and
nearly 1.5 million students receiving the maximum Pell Grant in
2024,12 the restoration of Pell Grant eligibility to incarcerated stu-
dents,13 and a $900 total increase in the maximum Pell Grant in
the year-end budget deals for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.14 Based
on this track record of recent successes, the Committee Print would

have been the perfect opportunity to reduce college costs for stu-
dents by increasing the value of the Pell Grant for all students. In-
stead, the Republicans made two changes to Pell Grant eligibility
that will result in fewer students receiving a Pell Grant.
First, the Committee Print changes the definition of ‘‘full time’’,
for Pell only, from 24 semester hours to 30 semester hours a year.
While Committee Republicans have sought to make changes to Pell
in multiple Congresses to incentivize on-time completion, those pro-
posals usually took the form of some type of bonus on top of the
maximum Pell Grant to incentivize students to take a larger
courseload. Here, recognizing any dollars spent to increase the Pell
Grant would be dollars that could not be saved to fund tax cuts for
the top 1%, Committee Republicans abandoned the idea of a bonus
to incentivize taking a larger courseload and instead adopted a pol-
icy creating a penalty for Pell recipients who do not take a larger
courseload. For low-income students who are balancing other re-
sponsibilities such as work and child care alongside their edu-
cation, part-time enrollment may be their sole option, and they
should not be penalized for that. Further, research shows that at
80% of institutions, Pell Grant recipients graduate on-time at a
lower rate than non-Pell recipients.15 Creating a penalty by raising
the number of semester hours required to receive a Pell Grant
seems in no way connected to the reasons why Pell recipients may
not complete college on time, and is not likely to increase comple-
tion rates, and instead penalize students.
Coupled with the change in the definition of ‘‘full time’’, the Com-
mittee Print also eliminates Pell Grant eligibility for students en-
rolled less than half time, which would be under 15 semester hours
a year. Under current law, eligible Pell Grant recipients receive a
prorated grant award based on the number of credit hours they
take in any semester. While the result may be that a student tak-
ing a smaller courseload may get a smaller Pell Grant, that smaller
grant is still pivotal to funding that student’s education. It’s money
that can cover tuition, fees, and living expenses that does not need
to be paid back. This is often the case for adult learners attending
school part time while working part time—they are Pell eligible
due to their need analysis, but don’t receive a full amount they are
eligible for. Instead of recognizing this is a fact of life for many low-
income students, the Committee Print will simply eliminate Pell
eligibility for many of these students, forcing them to either finance
their current course load through other means, or to take more
course hours each semester, decreasing the time they can work.
Committee Democrats feel that ending Pell eligibility for students
enrolled less than half time simply refuses to recognize the realities
faced by modern students. The result will be fewer students pur-
suing higher education, the exact opposite goal of the original au-
thors of the Higher Education Act of 1965.
Committee Democrats were also surprised that the Majority in-
cluded Workforce Pell Grants in the Committee Print. Last Con-
gress, the Democrats and Republicans negotiated and introduced

H.R. 6585, the Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act, a bill that would
allow students to use Pell Grants to enroll in high-quality, short-
term workforce programs. The Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act was
carefully negotiated, and included language to ensure that unscru-
pulous programs could not take students’ valuable Pell dollars and
leave them without a worthwhile credential. While the partisan
language the Committee considered does include Workforce Pell
Grants with a structure that is similar to the Bipartisan Workforce
Pell Act, it does not include key consumer protection guardrails to
protect students.
Campus-Based Aid
The Committee Print includes a new grant program, Promoting
Real Opportunities to Maximize Investments in Savings in Edu-
cation (PROMISE). As it was originally proposed in the College
Cost Reduction Act PROMISE would be a performance-based grant
to reward institutions for providing strong earnings outcomes,
keeping tuition low, and matriculating low-income students. To re-
ceive a PROMISE grant, an institution must provide students with
a maximum total price guarantee, establishing the most money an
institution could charge the student to complete their program,
based on the student’s family income and financial need.
Though Committee Democrats generally support the creation of
programs that increase postsecondary access opportunities for low-
and middle-income students, we have several concerns with the
PROMISE program. First, PROMISE grants would essentially
function as a block grant to institutions, with few enumerated re-
quirements in the bill as to their use. There was not even a provi-
sion requiring some minimum percentage of the grant aid to be di-
rectly given to students to offset their need, so a school could use
its grant for various purposes rather than ‘‘maximizing investments
in savings in education’’.
Additionally, Committee Democrats worry the maximum total
price guarantee requirement will disincentivize schools from par-
ticipating in the PROMISE program. While this attempt to control
college costs is commendable, it is imperative that proposed policies
to keep higher education affordable are actually viable. In this
case, it is unclear whether institutions would significantly cap tui-
tion costs just to become eligible to participate in a program with
no guarantee that it will receive funds. Further, public institutions
are particularly at risk of not accessing these funds, since tuition
at most public institutions is determined by state and local govern-
ments.16 The volatile and unpredictable nature of state funding for
higher education makes it challenging for public institutions to
guarantee tuition levels for multiple years at a time, meaning they
will likely be ineligible for PROMISE grants due to factors beyond
their control.17
Additionally, Committee Democrats worry whether the Com-
mittee Print’s PROMISE provisions include resources sufficient
enough to make a meaningful difference for students. Under the

proposal the funding to make the grants would come from the pro-
ceeds of the risk sharing scheme proposed in the Committee Print,
and after the first year of implementation funds returned to title
IV under HEA section 484B. Under the PROMISE proposal from
the College Cost Reduction Act, if the risk sharing scheme did not
produce enough funds for eligible schools to receive PROMISE
grants, the bill required prioritization of institutions with the high-
est percentages of low-income students for PROMISE funding.18
But since the Committee Print must follow the stricter rules of
Budget Reconciliation, grant funds are ratably reduced for all eligi-
ble institutions. Funding a proposal in such a manner without a
guarantee that all eligible institutions, and most importantly stu-
dents at their institutions, will have the ability to benefit from the
program, is unwise.
Finally, it is not lost on Committee Democrats that this is an at-
tempt to co-opt the ‘‘PROMISE’’ branding in higher education,
which has generally come to refer to programs across the country
that provide free (or highly subsidized) semesters of community col-
lege.19 Relatedly the America’s College Promise Act (ACP),20 a bill
first introduced in 2015, establishes a federal-state partnership to
expand access to higher education by providing two years of tui-
tion-free community college and creating grants for Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Uni-
versities21 and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to provide two
years of tuition-free education. The Republican’s PROMISE pro-
gram is fundamentally different from what Committee Democrats
offered in ACP or the Promise programs that the non-profit College
Promise indicates are at ‘‘approximately 104 community college
and university programs offered across 45 states.’’ The PROMISE
program as included in Committee Print does not offer a real mech-
anism to solve issues of college affordability and completion.
Limiting Access to Federal Student Loans
The Committee Print revises the aggregate and annual Direct
Loan limits for undergraduate and graduate students. The current
aggregate Direct Loan limits are $31,000 for dependent under-
graduate students, $57,500 for independent undergraduate stu-
dents, and $138,500 for graduate and professional students.22 The
Committee Print changes the aggregate limit to $50,000 for de-
pendent and independent undergraduate students, $100,000 for
graduate students, and raises the limit to $150,000 for professional
graduate students. Independent undergraduate students and non-

professional graduate students will face drastic cuts to their total
federal student loan eligibility from these limits. In conjunction
with other loan changes detailed below, most students will be
worse off with this proposal.
The Committee Print also eliminates the subsidization of under-
graduate loans. Under current law, a portion of an undergraduates
Direct Loans would have the interest rate subsidized so those loans
were not accruing interest while the undergraduate was in school.
The rationale is simple: we should not penalize the student for not
paying back their loan while they are enrolled and studying. This
simple change will result in billions saved that can be spent on tax
cuts, but will have drastic implications on the student loan bal-
ances of millions of undergraduate students.
The Committee Print also allows institutions to cap loans even
further based on program of study. This will create significant af-
fordability issues for students preparing for impactful careers in
fields with traditionally low earnings, such as teaching and social
work. Several higher education and consumer protection advocates
fear that giving colleges this authority will ‘‘threaten universal ac-
cess to student loans’’23 and restrict college access for students
whose needs are not otherwise met.24
The Committee Print, consistent with H.R. 6951, also eliminates
Parent PLUS and Graduate PLUS loans for all future borrowers.
The PLUS program is not without its faults,25 but taking a hatchet
to the program instead of a scalpel will only drive families and
graduate students to the predatory private loan market26 to fi-
nance higher education. Advocates across the political spectrum
have emphasized that to successfully steer students and families
away from PLUS loans, robust front-end student aid and increased
institutional aid are essential.27 Eliminating PLUS Loans without
providing such additional front-end aid will likely have a disastrous
effect on the demographic groups that disproportionately relies on
PLUS Loans, low-income and first generation students. The fami-
lies of these students tend to take out Parent PLUS loans at higher
rates compared to other student groups due in part to having less
generational wealth and fewer financial resources generally.28
Taken together, the Committee Print’s ‘‘affordability’’ provisions
could result in many students being unable to afford graduate de-
grees. By eliminating Grad PLUS loans, lowering Direct Loan lim-
its, and providing no other increases in grant aid, access to careers
that require graduate education will be severely limited since the
cost of attendance for many of these programs will now exceed

many students’ total federal student aid eligibility.29 This financing
structure will inevitably harm low-income students and students of
color by either requiring them to take out predatory private loans
to finance their education or forcing them to walk away from high-
er education entirely, with a sizable amount of debt but no degree
to help pay it off. Committee Democrats welcome conversations on
ways to address the serious concerns about the PLUS program but
any actions we take must not come at the expense of compromising
access and affordability for students.
Loan Repayment Plans
The Committee Print streamlines the repayment options avail-
able to Direct Loan program participants into two plans: a stand-
ard repayment plan and a new repayment assistance plan. While
higher education advocates have long asked Congress to streamline
the loan program,30 the model in the Committee Print is not de-
signed to support borrowers; rather, its proposed ‘‘assistance’’ plan
will leave some borrowers paying until they die and will lead many
more to making decades of unaffordable payments. The bill’s repay-
ment assistance plan (RAP) is tiered by amount borrowed and by
the borrower’s Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Under the RAP plan
all borrowers, even those with no income, would be required to
make a monthly payment of at least $10. Additionally, unlike cur-
rent income-based repayment plans, borrowers are not eligible for
forgiveness until they’ve been in repayment for 30 years, so many
borrowers could end up making payments on their loans for their
entire life without receiving any relief. Higher education advocates
are concerned that this new plan will make higher education less
affordable and drive more borrowers into delinquency and de-
fault.31
This proposal is a stark contrast to the Saving on a Valuable
Education (SAVE) Plan developed by the Biden Administration.32
The SAVE plan was the most generous repayment plan ever estab-
lished and was designed to drastically help low- and middle-income
borrowers finance their educations. Compared to the proposed RAP
in the Committee Print, the SAVE Plan requires borrowers to
make payments equal to 5 percent of their discretionary income
(calculated as any income above 225 percent of the federal poverty
level). The Department of Education estimated that once fully im-
plemented, more than one million low-income borrowers would
have qualified for $0 loan payments per month, allowing families

from attending programs that could leave them better off, particularly low-income students and
students of color who may lack alternative options to access graduate education financing.’’).

to focus on the basic needs of food, housing, and transportation.33
Under the SAVE plan ‘‘borrowers will see their total payments per
dollar borrowed fall by 40%. Borrowers with the lowest projected
lifetime earnings will see payments per dollar borrowed fall by 83
percent.’’34 Based on attacks from Republican State Attorneys Gen-
eral, the SAVE plan was prevented from ever being fully imple-
mented, and under the Trump administration it is officially no
longer an option. Committee Democrats will continue to advocate
for the concepts embodied in the SAVE plan, which we believe will
better allow borrowers to manage their higher education debt and
focus on their other financial needs.
The Committee Print also prohibits the Secretary of Education
(Secretary) from developing new repayment plans or modifying ex-
isting repayment plans if those changes would be considered ‘‘eco-
nomically significant’’ and increase subsidy costs to the federal gov-
ernment. This is extremely concerning because, if it became law, no
future administration—Democrat or Republican—would have the
authority to make common-sense changes to loan repayment that
support the needs of borrowers. This prohibition is a direct attack
on the Biden Administration’s attempts to improve student loan re-
payment for borrowers.35 Any disinterested party would realize it
is crucial that the Secretary has the flexibility to respond to the
ever-changing needs of borrowers; the COVID–19 pandemic was a
perfect example of the nimbleness needed to address borrowers’
economic struggles.36
Public Service Loan Forgiveness
The Committee Print does not make extensive changes to the
Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program; however, it ex-
cludes student loan payments made during medical and dental in-
ternships and residencies as qualifying payments towards PSLF.
During the markup Rep. Lucy McBath (GA–06) noted that
residencies and internships reflect a time when doctors and den-
tists are working the longest hours of their careers for the least
pay. During this time, under the RAP plan they could be forced to
pay $10 a month while potentially having little to no actual in-
come. Some of the more complex dental residency programs last 6
years,37 meaning that a borrower could be in active repayment for
6 years working at the Department of Veteran’s Affairs38 and none
of those 72 payments would qualify towards eventual forgiveness.

Additionally, according to the American Dental Association (ADA),
many dental students rely on PSLF as part of their student loan
management strategy to reduce their overall financial burden.39
Cutting PSLF for dental and medical internships and residencies
will result in fewer doctors and dentists in underserved commu-
nities, especially rural communities which are already facing a
healthcare shortage crisis.40
Borrower Supports
While H.R. 6951 included some strong bipartisan provisions to
support borrowers in repayment, such provisions cost money, and
as a result had to be modified or eliminated from the Committee
Print. The Committee Print admirably left in place a provision to
allow borrowers to rehabilitate their defaulated loans twice, rather
than the current limit of just once. This will provide borrowers
struggling with default additional opportunities to improve their fi-
nancial wellbeing. Unfortunately the other two consumer protec-
tions from H.R. 6951 were either deeply modified or eliminated
completely. For example H.R. 6951 eliminated interest capitaliza-
tion in all instances, building off work the Biden Administration
undertook to eliminate interest capitalization in the six places in
law it had the authority to do so.41 But the Committee Print only
eliminates capitalization of interest for borrowers enrolled in the
new RAP—leaving other four other instances where borrowers will
see unpaid interest added to their principle.42 But the third and
final bipartisan proposal from H.R. 6951, the elimination of origi-
nation fees on all new student loans, was not included in the Com-
mittee Print at all. Origination fees were originally established to
offset costs of the now-defunct Federal Family Education Loan
(FFEL) program.43 The current origination fees of 1 percent for Di-
rect Loans and 4 percent for PLUS loans significantly contribute to
increased loan balance, especially for graduate borrowers.44 Their
elimination has significant bipartisan support in Congress; they
were all included in the Lowering Obstacles to Achieve Now
(LOAN) Act in the 118th Congress.45

THE MAJORITY GUTS FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK,
LEAVING STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS VULNERABLE
Risk Sharing Agreements
The Majority proposes a risk-sharing agreement in which all in-
stitutions must compensate the federal government for a portion of
the unpaid principal and interest on loans for their students. The
‘‘risk sharing’’ model has long been a Republican policy goal de-
signed to encourage institutions to ‘‘have skin in the game’’ with re-
spect to student loan repayment rates.46
Committee Democrats, although not opposed to holding institu-
tions accountable for student outcomes, have significant concerns
with this risk-sharing proposal. This model will encourage institu-
tions to judge programs of study solely on their ability to provide
immediate financial benefits to their graduates. Many essential
programs of study such as education or social work, are obviously
necessary but do not always have simple return on investment
equations. Other programs, like many liberal arts programs, pay
off for students, but on a longer time horizon than contemplated by
the Republicans risk sharing scheme. The policy is also deeply wor-
rying for under-resourced institutions and institutions that dis-
proportionately serve low-income students and students of color,
such as community colleges, HBCUs, and MSIs. Many scholars
have expressed concern that without incorporating multiple dy-
namic metrics that take into account the demographics of students
that institutions serve, the risk-sharing model will create perverse
incentivizes for institutions to enroll high-income students who are
most well situated to graduate and repay their student debt.47 The
bill does not include any mechanisms to address these concerns,
nor does it contain anything requiring institutions or the federal
government to measure potential effects of the policy. Committee
Democrats support accountability frameworks that will incentivize
institutions to effectively serve high-need students and ensure their
degree completion, not proposals such as the one included in the
Committee Print that has the potential to deny such students ac-
cess to high-quality education.
Ultimately, the biggest concern for Committee Democrats is that
Committee Republicans view the risk-sharing model as the sole ac-
countability tool for institutions. Even if this model was successful,
it does not provide accountability for other serious financial risks
that unscrupulous institutions pose to students and taxpayers.
Deregulation
By far one of the most egregious components of the Committee
Print is the complete dismantling of the existing federal account-
ability framework designed to protect students and taxpayers from
waste, fraud, and abuse in higher education. The statutory and

regulatory oversight mechanisms repealed in the bill are vital tools
the Department of Education (Department) uses to ensure students
get the full benefit of federal student aid through monitoring insti-
tutions that pose significant risks and penalizing such institutions
accordingly.
90/10
Repealed under the Committee print, the 90/10 rule requires that
for-profit institutions receive no greater than 90 percent of their
revenue from federal aid. This provision was first established by
Congress in the 1992 HEA reauthorization to prohibit for-profit en-
tities from deriving the entirety of their revenue from the federal
government.48 Unscrupulous for-profit colleges have long preyed on
vulnerable student populations to increase their revenue without
providing these students a valuable education.49 In recent years,
these institutions have increasingly preyed on veterans, since their
G.I. Benefits did not count under the 90 percent cap.50 In 2021,
Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a
bipartisan provision to close this loophole and prevent institutions
from targeting veterans for their benefits.51
Despite strong bipartisan support for closing this loophole,52
Committee Republicans continue to argue that the 90/10 rule is an-
other part of the Democratic ‘‘educational agenda’’ to ‘‘expand fed-
eral intervention at the expense of students and taxpayers.’’53 And
it is worth noting that while Committee Republicans regularly
claim to prioritize taxpayers, CBO estimated that a previous at-
tempt by Republicans to repeal the 90/10 rule would have cost tax-
payers $2 billion over the 2018–2027 period.54
Committee Democrats have witnessed the ongoing predatory be-
haviors of certain for-profit institutions, particularly with respect to
veterans,55 and are appalled by the removal of this bipartisan ac-
countability framework. Congress has a responsibility to protect
America’s veterans from being manipulated by the for-profit indus-
try.
48The original rule established in the 1992 HEA reauthorization had an 85/15 revenue split.

Gainful Employment
The gainful employment (GE) rule, also repealed by the Com-
mittee Print, sets a meaningful and necessary framework for the
Department to enforce compliance with the statutory requirement
under the HEA that vocational training programs prepare students
for gainful employment. The GE rule helps ensure students are at-
tending programs designed to support their postsecondary needs
and prepare them to have good jobs in the workforce. The rule also
saves significant money for taxpayers; analysis indicates that the
previous Trump Administration’s previous recission of the GE rule
risked losing roughly $6.2 billion in taxpayer funds over ten years
through Pell Grants and student loans flowing to low-quality pro-
grams that leave students with high levels of debt and low earn-
ings.56
Thankfully, in 2023, the Biden Administration released the
strongest ever GE rule to protect students from low-quality train-
ing programs by establishing metrics related to high levels of debt
and low post-completion earnings.57 The Department estimates
that 92 percent of public institutions and 97 percent of private non-
profit institutions have no programs that fail the new GE rule.58
Comparatively, despite for-profit institutions accounting for only 11
percent of GE programs, 55 percent of these institutions have at
least one program of study that does not pass one of the two GE
metrics, and nearly 90 percent of students in failing GE programs
attend for-profit institutions.59 Due to the disproportionate level of
failing programs at for-profit institutions, the Department esti-
mates that as a consequence of the GE rule, there will be signifi-
cant enrollment shifts from low-quality programs to programs at
community colleges and HBCUs.
Committee Republicans have decried this rule as a ‘‘witch hunt’’
against for-profit institutions60 and continue to ignore the what
the data clearly shows: low-quality for-profit programs will con-
tinue to bilk students and taxpayers unless they are held account-
able for poor student outcomes.
Borrowers Defense to Repayment

rowers who have been defrauded by colleges that engaged in cer-
tain instances of gross misconduct.61 In 2022, the Biden Adminis-

tration released a new borrowers defense regulation that estab-
lishes the strongest framework yet for borrowers to raise a defense
to repayment if their institution has misled or harmed them.62
Since promulgating this rule, the Department has discharged more
than $14.8 billion in loans for over one million borrowers through
borrowers defense.63
While Committee Republicans paint the Department as being the
‘‘judge, jury, and executioner’’ of targeted debt relief such as bor-
rowers defense,64 it must be underscored that borrowers defense
also helps recover significant amounts of cancelled loan amounts
from institutions, which helps ensure taxpayers are not harmed by
the gross misconduct of an institution.65 While repealing this rule
will make it extremely hard for defrauded students to receive loan
discharges to which they are entitled, it will also allow disreputable
schools to get away with their misconduct and leave taxpayers
holding the bag. Committee Democrats remain committed to sup-
porting students who have been defrauded by their institutions
and, through no fault of their own, have not reaped the benefits of
a higher education.
Closed School Discharge
When institutions close precipitously, students are often left
scrambling to try to transfer to another institution, and many do
not ultimately transfer. The closed school discharge rule helps bor-
rowers get a ‘‘fresh start’’ after a school closure by discharging stu-
dent loans taken out at the closed school.66 The Biden Administra-
tion strengthened the closed school discharge rule by providing an
automatic loan discharge for all borrowers one year after the clo-
sure of their institution.67 This rule is an essential backstop for
students who were promised an education and a credential they
never received through no fault of their own. The Majority will
wrongfully remove this tool from defrauded borrowers, and Com-
mittee Republicans have produced no justification for its elimi-
nation.
Prohibition on Promulgating Regulations
The Committee Print prohibits the Secretary, and all future Sec-
retaries, from implementing any substantially similar regulations
to the repealed or revised regulations in the bill. This is another
direct attack on the significant progress the Biden Administration
made to strengthen higher education regulations to protect stu-

dents and taxpayers.68 Throughout last Congress, Committee Re-
publicans have touted the importance of accountability in higher
education.69 Yet, they have proposed to eliminate these protections
and restrict future federal engagement on them without proposing
a robust alternative accountability framework.
It cannot be understated that this extreme deregulation agenda
will erode the integrity of the federal student aid system and signal
that the federal government does not have the responsibility to pro-
tect students and taxpayers from waste, fraud, and abuse in higher
education. Committee Democrats believe the existing accountability
framework—augmented by improvements by the Biden Adminis-
tration—is an essential oversight mechanism for America’s stu-
dents and taxpayers.

CONCLUSION
The Committee Print includes harmful policies that will erode
the integrity of the Title IV program and the U.S. higher education
system as a whole. It reduces access to college, makes college edu-
cation less affordable, and eliminates customer protections for bor-
rowers. At a fundamental level it increases the share of the cost
of higher education borne by students, who will pay more for longer
to go to school. And it does all this simply to provide funding for
billionaire tax cuts. Committee Democrats cannot support legisla-
tion that will leave students and borrowers worse off, especially
when done for this purpose. For this and the reasons stated above,
Committee Democrats unanimously opposed the Committee Print
when the Committee on Education and the Workforce considered it
on April 29, 2025. We strongly urge the House of Representatives
to do the same.

percentage of Medicaid taxable units.
‘‘(II) Within a permissible class, the tax rate imposed on any
taxpayer or tax rate group (as so defined) based upon its Med-
icaid taxable units (as so defined) is higher than the tax rate
imposed on any taxpayer or tax rate group based upon its non-
Medicaid taxable unit (as defined in paragraph (7)(I)).
‘‘(III) The tax excludes or imposes a lower tax rate on a tax-
payer or tax rate group (as so defined) based on or defined by
any description that results in the same effect as described in
subclause (I) or (II) for a taxpayer or tax rate group. Charac-
teristics that may indicate such type of exclusion include the
use of terminology to establish a tax rate group—
‘‘(aa) based on payments or expenditures made under
the program under this title without mentioning the term
‘Medicaid’ (or any similar term) to accomplish the same ef-
fect as described in subclause (I) or (II); or

group under the program under this title, to the same ef-
fect as described in subclause (I) or (II).’’; and
(2) in paragraph (7), by adding at the end the following new
subparagraphs:
‘‘(H) The term ‘Medicaid taxable unit’ means a unit that is
being taxed within a health care related tax that is applicable

Medicaid bed days);
‘‘(ii) Medicaid revenue;
‘‘(iii) costs associated with the program under this title
(such as Medicaid charges, claims, or expenditures); and
‘‘(iv) other units associated with the program under this
title, as determined by the Secretary.
‘‘(I) The term ‘non-Medicaid taxable unit’ means a unit that
is being taxed within a health care related tax that is not ap-
plicable to the program under this title. Such term includes a
unit that is used as the basis for—
‘‘(i) payment by non-Medicaid payers (such as non-Med-
icaid bed days);
‘‘(ii) non-Medicaid revenue;
‘‘(iii) costs that are not associated with the program
under this title (such as non-Medicaid charges, non-Med-
icaid claims, or non-Medicaid expenditures); and
‘‘(iv) other units not associated with the program under
this title, as determined by the Secretary.
‘‘(J) The term ‘tax rate group’ means a group of entities con-
tained within a permissible class of a health care related tax
that are taxed at the same rate.’’.
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section
shall take effect upon the date of enactment of this Act, subject to
any applicable transition period determined appropriate by the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, not to exceed 3 fiscal years.

plan (or a waiver of such plan) under this title, con-
tinue to provide such individual with medical assist-
ance during such 30-calendar-day period; and

spect to the individual, there is any other basis for
eligibility for medical assistance under the State
plan (or waiver of such plan) or for another insur-
ance affordability program; and

treated as not providing medical assistance to all individ-
uals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), or as not
expending amounts for all such individuals under the
State plan (or waiver of such plan), solely because such an
individual is determined ineligible for medical assistance
under the State plan (or waiver) on the basis of a failure
to meet the requirement to demonstrate community en-
gagement under paragraph (1).

36B(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, an indi-

in the retail prescription drug supply chain in part D of title
XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w–101 et seq.).
Such study shall summarize information from Federal agencies
and industry experts, to the extent available, with respect to
the following:
(A) The type, magnitude, other features (such as the
pricing benchmarks used), and prevalence of compensation
and payment structures related to a prescription drug’s
price, such as calculating fee amounts as a percentage of
a prescription drug’s price, between intermediaries in the
prescription drug supply chain, including—

(ii) PDP sponsors offering prescription drug plans
and Medicare Advantage organizations offering MA–
PD plans;
(iii) drug wholesalers;
(iv) pharmacies;
(v) manufacturers;
(vi) pharmacy services administrative organizations;
(vii) brokers, auditors, consultants, and other enti-
ties that—
(I) advise PDP sponsors offering prescription
drug plans and Medicare Advantage organizations
offering MA–PD plans regarding pharmacy bene-
fits; or
(II) review PDP sponsor and Medicare Advan-
tage organization contracts with pharmacy benefit
managers; and
(viii) other service providers that contract with any
of the entities described in clauses (i) through (vii)
that may use price-related compensation and payment
structures, such as rebate aggregators (or other enti-
ties that negotiate or process price concessions on be-
half of pharmacy benefit managers, plan sponsors, or
pharmacies).
(B) The primary business models and compensation
structures for each category of intermediary described in
subparagraph (A).
(C) Variation in price-related compensation structures
between affiliated entities (such as entities with common
ownership, either full or partial, and subsidiary relation-
ships) and unaffiliated entities.
(D) Potential conflicts of interest among contracting enti-
ties related to the use of prescription drug price-related
compensation structures, such as the potential for fees or
other payments set as a percentage of a prescription drug’s
price to advantage formulary selection, distribution, or
purchasing of prescription drugs with higher prices.
(E) Notable differences, if any, in the use and level of
price-based compensation structures over time and be-

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Federal spending is unsustainably outpacing revenues, and a
revolution of common-sense reform is necessary to strengthen and
preserve our nation’s fiscal independence and prosperity. The pur-
pose of the Committee on Energy and Commerce’s budget reconcili-
ation legislative recommendations is to advance a combination of
common-sense deficit reduction and targeted offsets that will sup-
port U.S. innovation, strengthen and reform Medicaid, and end
Green New Deal-Style waste.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
On April 10, 2025, the House of Representatives agreed to the
Senate amendment to H. Con. Res. 14, a concurrent resolution set-
ting forth the congressional budget for the United States Govern-
ment for fiscal year (FY) 2025, setting forth the appropriate budg-
etary levels for FY 2026 through FY 2034, and providing reconcili-
ation instructions. The resolution included the following budget
reconciliation instructions for the Committee: The Committee on
Energy and Commerce shall submit changes in laws within its ju-
risdiction to reduce the deficit by not less than $880,000,000,000
for the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
SUBTITLE A—ENERGY
Energy is essential to the nation’s economy, its productive capac-
ity, its security, and the health and welfare of the public. The
United States is blessed with tremendous natural resources and an

economic system that fosters the free flow of capital to support in-
novation and technological capabilities. It also maintains the most
sophisticated and efficient system of energy production and deliv-
ery in the world. The vast and complex electricity systems in this
country deliver uninterrupted power to the public, manufacturers,
and industry. These energy systems serve to provide for the afford-
able, reliable energy and electric power necessary to expand Amer-
ica’s security and create the goods and services essential to a mod-
ern economy, along with providing for the public welfare.
America’s shale revolution transformed the nation’s energy pos-
ture in the world and underscores the benefits of American energy
expansion. The nation has emerged as the world’s number one pro-
ducer of oil and natural gas, and the number one exporter of
liquified natural gas (LNG). This status as a leading world pro-
ducer and exporter of oil and gas has brought significant benefits
to the domestic economy, U.S. energy security, and allies overseas.
Since 2016, U.S. LNG is estimated to have contributed $408 bil-
lion to our domestic Gross Domestic Product and supports 273,000
direct, indirect, or induced jobs. Expanded U.S. LNG exports also
benefit U.S. energy security and national security by reducing the
influence of Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in international markets. Russia’s war on
Ukraine exposed the world’s vulnerability to unstable energy sup-
pliers, especially in Europe, emphasizing the importance of stable,
secure, and more affordable American natural gas supplies. In the
wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. LNG replaced upwards
of 50 percent of Russian natural gas importations into European
nations.1
Energy exploration and production provide immense economic
benefits to states and local municipalities where royalties and asso-
ciated taxes provide funding for public resources such as schools,
firefighters, public safety officials, and other activities to the ben-
efit of local communities. For example, the members of the Texas
Oil and Natural Gas Association paid $27.3 billion in state and
local taxes and state royalties in 2024.2
Oil and natural gas account for about 74 percent of the primary
energy sources consumed in the U.S. every year, with natural gas
accounting for some 43 percent of electric power generation, accord-
ing to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.3 Natural gas
provides the largest share of baseload and dispatchable electric
power generation. This share has increased as various state and
federal policies have led to the shut-down of baseload and
dispatchable generation over the past decade, a trend that acceler-
ated in recent years, particularly for coal-fired generation.4

Meanwhile, after years of minimal growth, electricity demand in
the United States is projected to grow nationally at a significant
rate through the end of the decade.5 Over the past several decades,
the electric grid experienced modest demand for electric power,
averaging about 0.5 percent growth per year since 2015; however,
recent estimates show annual growth rate ranging between 3.7 per-
cent to 15 percent by 2030.6 Much of this growth is expected to
come from industrial facilities and data centers powering the in-
creasing use of AI. By the end of the decade, data centers that are
driving increases in electricity demand could consume as much as
9.1 percent of all electricity in the United States.7
Projections for a surge in demand for reliable power for AI come
at a time when the North American Electric Reliability Corporation
(NERC) has repeatedly raised concerns over the adequacy and reli-
ability of the grid. These concerns with the U.S. grid are due to a
confluence of factors that have forced premature retirements of re-
liable generation without adequate replacement generation and
electric infrastructure. The head of the NERC stated he believes
the United States is headed for a reliability crisis.8
While much of the new generation seeking interconnection to the
bulk power system consists of wind and solar, these intermittent
resources cannot meet the reliability needs of high-tech manufac-
turing and data centers on their own as they are not a one-to-one
replacement of existing non-intermittent, dispatchable resources
like coal, natural gas, hydropower or nuclear.
SUBTITLE B—ENVIRONMENT
Since 2022, the cost, effectiveness, and implementation of provi-
sions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have been called into
question. The climate and energy provisions in the 2022 Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) will significantly increase the deficit, far more
than originally anticipated. Updated projections of the IRA esti-
mate the cost of climate and energy provisions have ballooned from
the projected $384.9 billion to $1.045 trillion.9 The University of
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School updated its budget estimate of the
IRA’s climate and energy provisions, from $384.9 billion between
2022–2031 to $1,045 billion for the same period. Goldman Sachs es-

timated that the IRA ‘‘will provide an estimated $1.2 trillion of [cli-
mate-related] incentives by 2032.’’10
In recent years, investigations and non-partisan sources have
raised concerns about implementation of the IRA’s funding pro-
grams. Offices of the Inspector General (OIG) at several agencies
have warned that the IRA provisions have increased risks of waste,
fraud, and abuse.11
The Committee has monitored EPA’s efforts to implement the
IRA’s grant programs including through hearings and letters re-
questing information from EPA.12 At a March 29, 2023, hearing be-
fore the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, EPA In-

The IRA appropriated EPA $41.456 billion—more than four
times the amount that Congress appropriated to EPA in fiscal year
2021. The IRA funding was allocated across 17 EPA programs—
seven of which were authorized for the first time as a result of IRA
amendments to the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. These
newly authorized programs included the establishment of the
Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicle grant program, which was created
through a new section 132 of the Clean Air Act and appropriated
$1 billion, 42 U.S.C. 7432; the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,
which was created through a new section 134 of the Clean Air Act
and appropriated $27 billion, 42 U.S.C. 7434; the Methane Emis-
sions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program for Petroleum and
Natural Gas Systems, which was created through a new section
136 of the Clean Air Act and appropriated $1.55 billion, 42 U.S.C.
7436; and the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant pro-
gram, which was established through a new section 138 of the
Clean Air Act and appropriated $3 billion, 42 U.S.C. 7438. Other
provisions of the IRA increased appropriated amounts for existing
EPA programs, including $235.5 million for air pollution reduction
and monitoring activities and $350 million for carbon labeling and
product declaration programs under the Clean Air Act.
On March 30, 2023, the EPA Office of Inspector General issued
a memorandum entitled, ‘‘Management Implication Report: Mitiga-
tion of Grant Fraud Vulnerabilities,’’ noting the IRA created sev-
eral new programs and that ‘‘Proper oversight of funding recipients
has always been critical to ensure proper stewardship of taxpayer
dollars. The importance of such oversight has increased in light of
the [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act] and the IRA. We are
issuing this report to inform the Agency of certain issues related
to the awarding and disbursement of grants, as well as to provide
considerations for the Agency to strengthen its grant-funding mech-
anisms.’’
This Subtitle repeals the authorizations and unobligated bal-
ances of funds made available to EPA under the IRA. This Subtitle
does not alter, amend, or rescind EPA’s other legal authorities or
appropriated dollars other than those that were included in the
IRA.
In 2024, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget esti-
mated that EPA’s proposed vehicle emissions rule would increase
the federal deficit by $280 billion through 2033, if finalized. This
Subtitle also repeals EPA’s final rule relating to ‘‘Multi-Pollutant
Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty
and Medium-Duty Vehicles,’’ (89 Fed. Reg. 27842), and the com-
panion National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s final rule
relating to ‘‘Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Pas-
senger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond
and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and
Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond,’’ (89 Fed. Reg. 52540).

SUBTITLE C—COMMUNICATIONS
Spectrum resources are vital for the United States economy and
have raised over $230 billion since 1993.17 The NTIA and the FCC
are the two agencies tasked by Congress to oversee and manage
our nation’s spectrum resources—a finite natural resource.18 NTIA
manages federal spectrum allocations as many Federal agencies
use spectrum to perform vital operations, including the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Department of Transportation, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.19 The FCC is responsible for
overseeing the non-Federal use of spectrum, including commercial
usage.20
The FCC, in collaboration with NTIA on federal spectrum bands,
has made spectrum frequencies available for next-generation wire-
less technology use. For the United States to stay a global leader
in the deployment of future wireless technologies, the FCC will
need to make additional spectrum available, particularly mid-band
spectrum, for commercial use. On November 13, 2023, the White
House released a National Spectrum Strategy and on March 12,
2024, NTIA released the National Spectrum Strategy Implementa-
tion Plan.21 Through this strategy, the U.S. government began the
process of studying federal spectrum bands that could be made
available for commercial use, and those processes are ongoing.
NTIA is working with federal licensees through the interagency
process to solicit their feedback on those bands.
The FCC has had the authority to auction licenses for spectrum
use since Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
in 1993 and has been conducting spectrum auctions since 1994.
However, this authority expired for the first time on March 9,
2023, limiting the ability of the FCC to conduct spectrum auctions
and raise revenue for the U.S. Treasury. This legislation would re-
authorize the FCC’s authority to conduct auctions through Sep-
tember 30, 2034, and the auctions conducted during that timeframe
are expected to raise $88 billion in revenue for the Treasury
through spectrum auction proceeds.
Subtitle C, Part 1 would generate approximately $88 billion in
revenue to the United States Treasury in spectrum auction pro-
ceeds through reauthorizing the Federal Communications Commis-
sion’s (FCC) spectrum auction authority through September 30,
2034 and directing at least 600 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum to be
identified and auctioned. The FCC and the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administration (NTIA) would be required
to identify at least 600 MHz of federal and commercial spectrum
to be identified for auction. Of the 600 MHz identified, at least 200
megahertz would be required to be auctioned within three years of

enactment, and the remaining identified spectrum would be re-
quired to be auctioned within six years of enactment. Finally, the
bill excludes the 3.1–3.45 GHz and 5.925–7.125 GHz frequencies
from being identified as part of the 600 MHz target.
This legislation requires at least 600 megahertz of spectrum to
be identified and auctioned before September 30, 2034. While the
legislation excludes certain frequencies, the Committee also directs
that the frequencies between 7.25 GHz–8.4 GHz to be excluded
from the 600 megahertz requirement. The Committee expects that
in identifying the 600 megahertz for auction, the FCC and NTIA
will work through the current processes for identifying and reallo-
cating spectrum as required by current law.
As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly evolves, it presents signifi-
cant opportunities for the United States, including for government
efficiency. This legislation proposes a $500 million investment in
modernizing the Department of Commerce’s information technology
systems with commercial AI and automation technologies. The fed-
eral government’s information technology systems are severely out-
dated, operating several generations behind state-of-the-art com-
mercial systems.22 This technological gap has hindered the effec-
tiveness of government operations, service delivery, and cybersecu-
rity, leaving federal departments, such as the Department of Com-
merce, ill-equipped to compete in a rapidly advancing technological
landscape. As the U.S. faces increasing global competition, particu-
larly from China in the realm of AI, the need for modernization is
urgent.23
This legislation also institutes a 10-year moratorium on state-
level AI regulations to ensure the Department of Commerce can
continue to access AI technologies moving forward. Premature or
overly restrictive laws could stifle technological progress, particu-
larly for startups and small businesses that are essential to driving
growth and innovation in this space.24 A patchwork of state-by-
state AI regulations is emerging, with over 1,000 AI-related bills
introduced in 2025 alone, creating barriers to entry and creating
compliance burdens for incumbents.25 The result of this patchwork
may be fewer technological innovations and higher costs for federal
agencies seeking to acquire AI. By pausing state-specific AI laws,
Congress can ensure that the Department of Commerce, as well as
other federal agencies, will have access to commercial AI systems
moving forward.26
Subtitle C, Part 2 establishes the Artificial Intelligence and In-
formation Technology Modernization Initiative within the Depart-
ment of Commerce. The bill appropriates $500 million for fiscal
year 2025, to remain available through September 30, 2035, to sup-
port the replacement of legacy IT systems, the deployment of com-
mercial artificial intelligence and automation technologies, and the

the legislation imposes a 10-year moratorium on most state and

cision systems, with limited exceptions, to ensure regulatory con-
sistency and promote innovation during the modernization process.
SUBTITLE D—HEALTH
According to National Health Expenditure (NHE) projections,
American health care expenditures grew 7.5 percent to $4.9 trillion
in 2023, comprising 17.6 percent of U.S. Gross Domestic Product
(GDP). The health care system’s unsustainable growth is projected
to continue—NHE projections estimated that over the course of
2023 to 2032, average NHE growth will outpace average GDP
growth.27 Past policies have failed to lower health care costs, jeop-
ardizing safety net programs on which millions of Americans rely.
The Medicaid program is jointly financed and administered by
the federal government and state programs. According to the Con-
gressional Budget Office (CBO), in fiscal year 2024, federal outlays
for the Medicaid program were $618 billion. CBO projects that fed-
eral spending on Medicaid will exceed a staggering $1 trillion by
2035, reaching parity with CBO’s projection of what the Federal
government will spend on national defense.28
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established federal and state in-
dividual and small business health exchanges. Health plans offer-
ing coverage on ACA exchanges receive federal subsidies, largely in
the form of advance premium tax credits. According to CBO and
Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) joint projections, ACA market-
place and Basic Health Program subsidies are projected to expand
to $1.1 trillion over the 2024 to 2033 budgetary window.29
CBO’s January 2025 baseline update illustrated the burden the
Medicaid program is under. Technical changes increased CBO’s
2025 estimate of Medicaid spending by $57 billion, or 10 percent,
and their estimate of the program’s spending over the budget win-
dow by $817 billion, or 12 percent.30 This is further reflected by
analysis from the National Association of State Budget Officers
(NASBO), who found that state Medicaid spending is estimated to
have grown 5.3 percent in fiscal year 2024, representing the ‘‘larg-
est category of total state expenditures’’ at 29.8 percent.31
Ultimately, individuals’ access to care in Medicaid is inextricably
linked to the costs of the program for the Federal government and
States. The growth in total Medicaid spending and enrollment is a
growing concern as it impedes the program’s ability to provide care
for those vulnerable populations who rely most on Medicaid. These
challenges are exacerbated by waste, fraud, and abuse in state
Medicaid programs. The Government Accountability Office’s (GAO)

2025 High-Risk List again identified Medicaid program integrity as
an area in which the ‘‘Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) needs to reduce billions in Medicaid improper payments, en-
sure the appropriate use of program dollars, and improve the qual-
ity of program data to better manage quality of care and efficiency
of payments for services.’’32
For state Medicaid programs to run as efficiently and effectively
as possible, the integrity of federal-state Medicaid financing must
be maintained. To do so, Congress must first address deficiencies
in enrollment processes that encourage fraud and ineligible individ-
uals to enroll in the program. For example, Congress must roll
back rules promulgated by the Biden Administration that will tie
states’ hands from effectively managing their Medicaid programs.
Moreover, Congress must take steps to reduce spending on ineli-
gible enrollees—this includes taking action to prevent beneficiaries
from being enrolled in multiple State programs, remove deceased
beneficiaries from Medicaid, and ensure that Federal Medicaid dol-
lars only fund enrollees whose citizenship, nationality, or immigra-
tion status has been verified.
Next, Congress must address excess waste in the program. The
Biden Administration finalized an untenable nursing home staffing
mandate for Medicare and Medicaid that will do little to improve
quality for beneficiaries. Congress must address Medicaid waste by
also holding pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) accountable and
modernizing retroactive coverage standards to prevent adverse se-
lection and reduce unexpected costs for the federal government and
state programs.
Additionally, Congress must tackle abusive financing practices
and misaligned incentives like provider taxes that allow states to
shift back to the federal government the cost of financing their
share of Medicaid spending. While current law requires that these
taxes be broad-based, uniform, and redistributive, hold harmless
arrangements are used to allow states to draw down federal dollars
without ever contributing additional funding. According to GAO,
‘‘states’ reliance on provider tax and local government funds, de-
creased states’ share of new Medicaid payments . . . and effec-
tively increased the federal share of net Medicaid payments by 5
percentage points in state fiscal year 2018.’’33
Moreover, states are increasingly utilizing these provider taxes to
fund expansions of state-directed payments (SDP). SDPs, a form of
supplemental payments created by CMS in 2016, arose as more en-
rollees shifted into managed care organization (MCO) arrange-
ments. Spending on these payments continues to grow, and regu-
latory changes during President Biden’s administration permitted
directed payments to reach as high as the average commercial
rate.34 The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission
(MACPAC) estimated that directed payments would exceed $69 bil-

lion in 2023, while CMS projects that directed payments will ex-
ceed $125 billion in 2033.35
Finally, Congress must increase personal accountability for the
Medicaid Expansion population. Health care and work are linked
in this country—roughly half of all Americans receive employer-
sponsored insurance through their job; eligibility for the ACA’s
marketplaces is contingent on having an income; Medicare bene-
ficiaries are only eligible for the program because they worked and
paid into the system; and service members and veterans get their
health care because of their work in service to our country. By es-
tablishing community engagement requirements for able-bodied
adults, Congress will promote the dignity of work and recognize the
value of beneficiaries’ engagement with their communities.
Congress must also provide the same attention to waste, fraud,
and abuse in the marketplaces established by the ACA. According
to NHE data, coverage in the marketplaces reached 16.2 million in
2023 with expenditures totaling $115 billion.36 Regulatory actions
pursued by the Biden Administration weakened commonsense en-
rollment and eligibility safeguards in the marketplaces, which has
led to program integrity concerns, market distortions, and billions
of dollars in additional costs to federal taxpayers.
These program integrity issues have a direct effect on consumers
seeking or maintaining coverage. Between January and August
2024, CMS received over 183,000 complaints that consumers were
enrolled in coverage through an exchange on the federal platform
without their consent (also known as unauthorized enrollment).37
From June 2024 to October 2024, CMS also suspended 850 agents
and brokers’ ACA Marketplace Agreements for reasonable sus-
picion of fraudulent or abusive conduct related to unauthorized en-
rollments or unauthorized plan switches. These bad actor brokers
would allegedly enroll people without their consent to collect com-
mission payments; switch people to different plans or agents with-
out notifying the enrollee; or split households into multiple plans
to inflate commissions.38 These are just a few examples dem-
onstrating the strain the marketplaces are under and the need to
restore programmatic guardrails to protect consumers and federal
taxpayers.
The growing aging population and growing Medicare expendi-
tures also necessitate action to protect the long-term fiscal health
of the program and promote access to high-quality, affordable
health care for seniors. Seniors are consistently seeing their drug
costs rise, which is evidenced by recent data published by the non-
partisan Government Accountability Office, which examines the
correlation between rebates and beneficiary drug spending in Medi-
care. This data showed how rebates affect formulary design and pa-

tients’ costs for medicines. Specifically, a 2023 report by GAO ana-
lyzing a sample of highly rebated drugs in Medicare Part D found
that ‘‘drugs with higher gross costs generally result in higher bene-
ficiary payments relative to payments for competing drugs with
lower gross costs.’’ Of the 100 highest rebated drugs in Part D in
2021, beneficiaries paid more than the plan sponsor for 79 of those
medicines once rebates were factored in. Patients spent over $20
billion for these drugs, while plan sponsors spent just over $5 bil-
lion.39 More independent analysis underscores these findings,
showing that for every $1 increase in rebates, list prices on pre-
scription medications increased by $1.17.40
Seniors are also losing access to more cost-effective generic medi-
cations that are equally as effective clinically as their reference
product. More data shows how generic medications have been in-
creasingly placed on non-preferred drug formularies in Medicare
Part D, leading to higher out-of-pocket spending for cheaper medi-
cations. In 2022, almost 60 percent of generic drugs were placed on
non-generic drug tiers by Part D plan sponsors.41
The policy in the underlying bill would address the rising costs
of prescription medications for seniors in Medicare through phar-
macy benefit manager reforms. Specifically, these reforms prohibit
PBM compensation from being based on list price or other factors
relating to formulary placement. The policy also imposes new
transparency requirements for PBMs in Medicare Part D by requir-
ing these entities to submit to the Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services as well as Part D plan sponsors information relating
to formulary placement decisions, drug dispensing data, and rela-
tionships with affiliated pharmacies.
The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has also
recently studied the rates at which physicians in Medicare are re-
imbursed for services provided to beneficiaries. The nonpartisan
commission specifically expressed concern relating to physician re-
imbursements in Medicare failing to keep pace with the rising costs
of providing care to beneficiaries and the concomitant impacts
these lagging reimbursement rates may have on seniors’ ability to
access care.42
The Committee shares these concerns and is furthermore con-
cerned with the increased consolidation in the health care system,
part of which is driven by physician burnout and reimbursement
rates that have failed to keep pace with inflation. More consolida-
tion in health care will lead to higher federal spending and more
out-of-pocket spending for seniors. As such, the policy in the under-
lying bill seeks to address unstable physician reimbursement rates
in Medicare to create more predictability for providers, preserve pa-

tient choice in how they get their care, and reduce health care
costs.
The Committee remains committed to ensuring seniors can main-
tain access to health care services that promote long-term health
and reduce spending. However, since the passage of the Inflation
Reduction Act (P.L. 117–169), Medicare Part D insurance pre-
miums have increased while plan offerings have substantially de-
creased.43 The law also made significant changes that will lead to
less treatment options for seniors and other vulnerable populations,
which research suggests may yield less generic drug entrants that
will offset any savings from the price controls established in the
law for pharmaceuticals. The Committee remains concerned by the
disincentives to develop cutting-edge medications in the Inflation
Reduction Act. As a result, the Committee is advancing policy that
will make technical corrections to the Inflation Reduction Act and
further incentivize the development of orphan drugs.

I hope this information is useful to you. Please contact me if you
have further questions.
Sincerely,
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director.

bases or similar systems to determine whether HHS or another
state has already terminated a provider or supplier from partici-
pating in Medicaid and to also disenroll them from the state’s Med-
icaid program.
Section 44106. Additional Medicaid provider screening re-
quirements
This section codifies the requirement that state Medicaid pro-
grams check, as part of the provider enrollment and re-enrollment
process and on a quarterly basis thereafter, the Social Security Ad-
ministration’s Death Master File to determine whether providers
are deceased and enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program.
Section 44107. Removing good faith waiver for payment re-
duction related to certain erroneous excess payments
under Medicaid
This section requires HHS to reduce federal financial participa-
tion (FFP) to States for errors identified through the ratio of a
State’s erroneous excess payments for medical assistance, by the
Office of the Inspector General, or by the Secretary are directly at-
tributable to payments to ineligible individuals or for ineligible
services.

Section 44108. Increasing frequency of eligibility redeter-
minations for certain individuals
This section requires States to conduct eligibility determinations
for Expansion population adults every six months. Current law cur-
rently requires such determinations to occur on every twelve
months.
Section 44109. Revising home equity limit for determining
eligibility for long-term care services under the Med-
icaid program
This section establishes a ceiling of $1,000,000 for permissible
home equity values for individuals when determining allowable as-
sets for Medicaid beneficiaries that are eligible for long-term care
services. This section also prohibits the use of asset disregards
from being applied to waive home equity limits.
Section 44110. Prohibiting federal financial participation
under Medicaid and CHIP for individuals without
verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigra-
tion status
This section prohibits FFP in Medicaid for individuals whose citi-
zenship, nationality, or immigration status has not been verified,
including during reasonable opportunity periods when an indi-
vidual has not yet verified citizenship, nationality, or immigration
status. Current law permits states to enroll individuals in coverage
immediately and then provide 90-day reasonable opportunities that
allow individuals to immediately begin receiving coverage and then
wait up to 90 days before verifying citizenship or immigration sta-
tus, all while receiving FFP during this period. This policy permits
states, at the state’s option, to provide coverage during a reason-
able opportunity period in which an individual may not yet have
provided evidence of citizenship, nationality, or immigration status,
so long as the state does not request FFP until citizenship, nation-
ality, or immigration status have been verified.
Section 44111. Reducing expansion FMAP for certain states
providing payments for health care furnished to certain
individuals
This section reduces by ten percent the Federal Medical Assist-
ance Percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid Expansion States who use
their Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage for il-
legal immigrants under Medicaid or another state-based program.
Subpart B—Preventing Wasteful Spending
Section 44121. Moratorium on implementation of rule relat-
ing to staffing standards for long-term care facilities
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs
This section requires HHS to delay implementation, administra-
tion, or enforcement of the final rule titled ‘‘Medicare and Medicaid
Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facili-
ties and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting’’
until January 1, 2035.

Section 44122. Modifying retroactive coverage under the
Medicaid and CHIP programs
This section limits retroactive coverage in Medicaid to one month
prior to an individual’s application date. Current law provides ret-
roactive coverage for up to three months before an individual’s ap-
plication date.
Section 44123. Ensuring accurate payments to pharmacies
under Medicaid
This section requires participation by retail and applicable non-
retail pharmacies in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost
(NADAC) survey. The NADAC survey measures pharmacy acquisi-
tion costs and is often used in the Medicaid program to inform re-
imbursement to pharmacies.
Section 44124. Preventing the use of abusive spread pricing
in Medicaid
This section bans ‘‘spread pricing’’ in the Medicaid program,
which occurs when pharmacy benefit managers retain a portion of
the amount paid to them (a ‘‘spread’’) for prescription drugs.
Section 44125. Prohibiting federal Medicaid and CHIP fund-
ing for gender transition procedures for minors
This section prohibits FFP for specified gender transition proce-
dures to individuals under the age of 18.
Section 44126. Federal payments to prohibited entities
This section prohibits Medicaid funds to be paid to providers that
are nonprofit organizations, that are essential community providers
that are primarily engaged in family planning services or reproduc-
tive services, provide for abortions other than for Hyde Amendment
exceptions, and which received $1,000,000 or more (to either the
provider or the provider’s affiliates) in payments from Medicaid
payments in 2024.
Subpart C—Stopping Abusive Financing Practices
Section 44131. Sunsetting eligibility for increased FMAP for
new expansion states
This section sunsets the temporary five percent enhanced FMAP
afforded to states under the American Rescue Plan Act that opt to
expand Medicaid. This provision would apply prospectively, not af-
fecting states currently receiving an enhanced federal match under
this authority.
Section 44132. Moratorium on new or increased provider
taxes
This section freezes, at current rates, states’ provider taxes in ef-
fect as of the date of enactment of this legislation and prohibits
states from establishing new provider taxes.

Section 44133. Revising the payment limit for certain state
directed payments
This section directs HHS to revise current regulations to limit
state directed payments for services furnished on or after the en-
actment of this legislation from exceeding the total published Medi-
care payment rate. This section would not affect total payment
rates for state directed payments approved prior to this legisla-
tion’s enactment.
Section 44134. Requirements regarding waiver of uniform
tax requirement for Medicaid provider tax
This section modifies the criteria HHS must consider when deter-
mining whether certain health care-related taxes are generally re-
distributive. Under this section, a tax would not be considered gen-
erally redistributive if, within a permissible class, the tax rate im-
posed on the taxpayer or tax rate group explicitly defined by its rel-
atively lower volume or percentage of Medicaid taxable units is
lower than the tax rate imposed on any other taxpayer or tax rate
group explicitly defined by its relatively higher volume or percent-
age of Medicaid taxable units. The tax would also not be considered
generally redistributive if, within a permissible class, the tax rate
imposed on any taxpayer or tax rate group based upon its Medicaid
taxable units is higher than the tax rate imposed on any taxpayer
or tax rate group based upon its non-Medicaid taxable unit.
If a State has a health care-related tax waiver that meets at
least one of these criteria as of the date of enactment of this legis-
lation, the waiver must be modified to comply with these require-
ments. This section provides a transition period for non-compliant
programs, after which a State whose health care-related taxes do
not adhere to all federal requirements would be penalized by the
sum of those revenues received by State.
Section 44135. Requiring budget neutrality for Medicaid
demonstration projects under section 1115
This section provides budget neutrality requirements for dem-
onstration projects under section 1115 of the Social Security Act.
HHS would be required to certify that the total expenditures for
FFP do not exceed what would otherwise have been spent under
Title XIX absent the demonstration project. HHS must also develop
methodologies for applying savings generated under a project as al-
lowable costs to be spent in a project’s extension.
Subpart D—Increasing Personal Accountability
Section 44141. Requirement for states to establish Medicaid
community engagement requirements for certain indi-
viduals
This section requires states to establish community engagement
requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. An indi-
vidual can meet the community engagement requirements during
a month by working at least 80 hours, completing at least 80 hours
of community service, participating in a work program for at least
80 hours, enrolling in an educational program for at least 80 hours,
or a combination of these activities for at least 80 hours.

The requirements of this section would not apply to the following
individuals: pregnant women, individuals under the age of 19 or
over the age of 64, foster youth and former foster youth under the
age of 26, members of a Tribes, individuals who are considered
medically frail (which includes, but is not limited to, individuals
who are blind or disabled, who have a chronic substance use dis-
order, who have a serious and complex medical condition, or who
have a condition, as defined by the State and approved by the Sec-
retary, as meeting the definition of medically frail), individuals who
are already in compliance with the work requirements under the
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program or Sup-
plemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), individuals who
are a parent or caregiver of a dependent child or an individual with
a disability, or are incarcerated or recently released from incarcer-
ation within the past 90 days. This section also provides short-term
hardship waivers for natural disasters and for counties where the
unemployment rate is greater than eight percent or greater than
150 percent of the national average.
Compliance with community engagement requirements would be
verified by states no less frequently than for the month preceding
an individual’s enrollment in Medicaid and in a month preceding
the individual’s eligibility redetermination and verified as part of
an individual’s overall eligibility determination or redetermination.
States would be required to provide regular, advanced notice and
outreach to make individuals aware of the requirements, would be
required to streamline and simplify processes to verify compliance
to reduce burdens on individuals, and to establish due process pro-
cedures for individuals before denying coverage or removing indi-
viduals from coverage.
Section 44142. Modifying cost sharing requirements for cer-
tain expansion individuals under the Medicaid program
This section requires states to impose cost sharing on Medicaid
Expansion adults with incomes over 100 percent of the federal pov-
erty level (FPL). This cost-sharing may not exceed $35 per service.
Cost sharing may not exceed five percent of the individual’s in-
come, which is the current out-of-pocket limit for Medicaid bene-
ficiaries. This section would not permit cost-sharing on prenatal
care, pediatric care, or emergency room care (except for non-emer-
gency care provided in an emergency room).
PART 2—AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
Section 44201. Addressing waste, fraud, and abuse in the
ACA exchanges
This section would institute eligibility and income verification
processes for Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) en-
rollees. In addition, it would roll back income-based special enroll-
ment periods in the federally-facilitated and state ACA exchanges.
This section would also make technical changes to health plans of-
fered via the ACA exchanges. It would institute ACA reenrollment
guardrails for enrollees in zero-dollar premium health plans. Addi-
tionally, this section would prohibit gender transition procedures
from being included as an essential health benefit (EHB), and it

would amend the definition of ‘‘lawfully present’’ for the purposes
of qualified health plan enrollment. This section would also permit
issuers to require enrollees to satisfy debt for past-due premiums
as a prerequisite for effectuating new health coverage. The provi-
sions within this section would take effect for plan years beginning
on or after January 1, 2026.
PART 3—IMPROVING AMERICANS’ ACCESS TO CARE
Section 44301. Expanding and clarifying the exclusion for
orphan drugs under the drug price negotiation program
This section makes technical corrections to current law by per-
mitting product sponsors to have one or more orphan drug indica-
tion in order to be exempt from the Drug Price Negotiation Pro-
gram in statute. Current law limits exemptions from the Drug
Price Negotiation Program to one rare disease indication. This sec-
tion also revises the start of the timeline in which a manufacturer
would be eligible for negotiation until an orphan drug receives its
first non-orphan indication.
Section 44302. Streamlined enrollment process for eligible
out-of-state providers under Medicaid and CHIP
For purposes of improving access to necessary out-of-state care
for children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program (CHIP), this section requires states to establish a
process through which qualifying pediatric out-of-state providers
may enroll as participating providers without undergoing addi-
tional screening requirements.
Section 44303. Delaying DSH reductions
This section delays the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital
(DSH) reductions, currently $8 billion reductions per year that are
set to take effect for fiscal years 2026 through 2028, to instead take
effect for fiscal years 2029 through 2031. This section also extends
funding for Tennessee’s DSH program, which is set to expire at the
end of this fiscal year, through fiscal year 2028.
Section 44304. Modifying update to the conversion factor
under the physician fee schedule under the Medicare
program
This section amends current law by replacing the split physician
fee schedule conversion factor set to take effect on January 1, 2026,
with a new single conversion factor based on a percentage of med-
ical inflation, or the Medicare Economic Index (MEI).
Section 44305. Modernizing and ensuring PBM account-
ability
This section requires Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) in
Medicare Part D to transparently share information relating to
business practices with Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan
Sponsors, including information relating to formulary decisions and
prescription drug coverage that benefits affiliated pharmacies. The
policy also prohibits PBM compensation based on a drug’s list
price, limiting compensation to fair market bona-fide service fees.

MINORITY, ADDITIONAL, OR DISSENTING VIEWS
MINORITY VIEWS
The House Republican budget is an extreme bill—Republicans
are intentionally and cruelly taking health care away from at least
13.7 million Americans and raising health care costs for millions
more so they can give giant tax breaks to the ultra-rich that don’t
need them.
President Trump and Republicans promised to lower everyday
costs for Americans, but prices have gone up because of Trump’s
reckless tariffs. And this Republican bill does not reduce everyday
prices for hardworking Americans—in fact, it drives prices up.
The only winners in the Republican budget scheme are billion-
aire donors like Elon Musk who will receive huge tax breaks. Ev-
eryday Americans cannot afford the Republican budget.
Subtitle A—Energy, Providing for Reconciliation Pursuant to H.
Con. Res. 14
Subtitle A contains billions of dollars of cuts to Inflation Reduc-
tion Act programs designed to enhance American energy security
and reduce costs. It also contains overhauls to permitting policies
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Depart-
ment of Energy (DOE) and grants FERC brand-new powers to
grant crude oil, petroleum product, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide
pipeline developers eminent domain authority. It creates a de-risk-
ing program designed specifically to cost taxpayers hundreds of
millions by picking winners and losers and making it harder for
clean sources of energy to compete. Finally, it rescinds hundreds of
millions of dollars from base annual discretionary funding for DOE
offices, making it harder for them to administer a variety of pro-
grams and incentives, specifically clean energy and energy effi-
ciency programs.
Section 41001 of Subtitle A, titled ‘‘Rescissions Relating to Cer-
tain Inflation Reduction Act Programs,’’ rescinds unobligated funds
from the State-Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training
Grants; the Loan Programs Office; Advanced Technology Vehicle
Manufacturing; Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing; the
Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program; Transmission Facility Fi-
nancing; Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity
Transmission Lines, Interregional and Offshore Wind Electricity
Transmission Planning, Modeling, and Analysis; and the Advanced
Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. Notably, many of the
targeted offices and programs support the financing and develop-
ment of energy efficiency, decarbonization, clean energy, and elec-
tric vehicle projects.
Rescinding funding from these offices and programs threatens
ongoing applications, project financing, and project development.

The programs targeted by Section 41001, specifically those in the
Loan Programs Office, are designed to support emerging tech-
nologies, support domestic manufacturing, and address rapid de-
mand growth.1 Rescissions can produce chilling effects on indus-
tries that are in early stages of development and growth, such as
many clean energy or critical minerals industries. These actions
harm the American manufacturing workforce, and hamper Amer-
ica’s ability to compete globally.
The cuts to the Loan Programs Office will be particularly dev-
astating to nuclear energy. As South Carolina Governor Henry
McMaster noted in a letter to his state’s congressional delegation,
‘‘. . . without the existing federal tax credits and loan programs for
nuclear power that make financing new nuclear power generation
possible, our efforts [to finish a nuclear plant] . . . are dead.’’2
Combined with the proposed phase-out of the 45U tax credit in the
Ways and Means Committee, Republicans are poised to completely
extinguish any hopes of building new nuclear energy in the United
States.3 No nuclear reactor this century has been built without fed-
eral support, and Republicans are preparing to pull the rug out
from an entire industry.
In addition to rescissions targeting Inflation Reduction Act pro-
grams, Section 41009 of Subtitle A, ‘‘Rescissions of Previously Ap-
propriated Unobligated Funds,’’ rescinds funding from a range of
DOE offices, including but not limited to, the Office of the Inspector
General, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Federal
Energy Management Programs, State and Community Energy Pro-
grams, the Office of Minority Economic Impact, the Office of En-
ergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office of General Coun-
sel, and the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The tar-
geting of funding for the Office of the Inspector General shows a
blatant disregard for good governance. And the targeting of clean
energy and energy efficiency offices again demonstrates a commit-
ment to gutting domestic clean energy development and access to
affordable energy.
For legislation ostensibly focused on the budget, Subtitle A also
contains a number of provisions making vast policy changes to the
way pipeline permits are handled, granting FERC sweeping new
powers to compel landowners to sell their land to developers of cer-
tain types of pipelines. Taken as a whole, these provisions do not
represent a mere expediting of energy infrastructure, but rather an
attempt to get rid of permitting processes altogether. As Rep. Joyce
admitted answering a question from Rep. Landsman during the
markup of this subtitle—these provisions represent questions of
policy, not revenue.
Section 41002 closely resembles H.R. 3062. By granting FERC
the authority to issue ‘‘certificates of crossing,’’ the bill transfers to
FERC authority currently vested in the President (for crude oil, hy-
drocarbon liquid, refined petroleum product, hydrogen, carbon diox-

ide, or other energy pipelines)4 and DOE (for electricity trans-
mission lines).56 It also completely removes any consideration of
foreign policy interests of the United States, which the State De-
partment is currently obligated to consider when advising the
President on Presidential permits for non-natural gas pipelines,
and would remove the requirement that FERC and DOE obtain
concurrence from the State Department and Department of De-
fense for natural gas and electricity transmission lines.78 Instead,
all consideration of foreign policy, the national defense, or the pub-
lic interest would be prohibited from being considered, and FERC
would be required to issue a certificate.
Section 41003 similarly transforms the authorization process to
export natural gas to countries the United States lacks a free trade
agreement with. Under section 3(a) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA),
DOE is required to determine whether a proposed export of natural
gas to a non-free trade agreement nation would be inconsistent
with the public interest.9 Section 41003 strips DOE of that require-
ment, and merely declares that any would-be exporter that pays
DOE $1 million would have its proposed export application auto-
matically found in the public interest. Given that DOE recently
found that unfettered exports of liquified natural gas (LNG) ‘‘. . .
would increase costs for the average American household by well
over $100 more per year . . .’’ keeping the public interest deter-
mination is vital.10
Contrary to what Committee counsel suggested during the mark-
up of this subtitle, there are presently zero legal hurdles in the law
barring LNG exports from going to China—in 2024 alone, the
United States exported 213 billion cubic feet of LNG to China. Re-
quiring any exporter to pay one million dollars and automatically
deeming their LNG exports—regardless of whether they are to
China or other geopolitical rivals—in the public interest is a threat
to our national security.
Section 41005 goes even further by upending not only FERC’s
permitting process for LNG export facilities and natural gas pipe-
lines, but every federal, state, or Tribal agency’s permitting poli-
cies. Again, similarly to sections 41002 and 41003, every applicant
would be guaranteed its permit would be approved by every rel-
evant agency.
This would particularly upend decades of precedent under the
Clean Water Act (CWA) allowing states to make their own deter-
minations under section 401 of the CWA. The CWA allows states
to determine if a proposed action complies with certain sections of
the CWA.11 The case of the Northeast Supply Enhancement
Project—a proposed pipeline project in New Jersey, New York, and
Pennsylvania—is a perfect example. New York’s Department of En-
vironmental Conservation thrice denied the project a water quality

certification pursuant to section 401 because it failed to meet New
York’s standards for mercury and copper.12 If Subtitle A had been
in effect at the time, New York would have had no choice but to
issue a permit for the project, destroying New York’s right to pro-
tect its citizens from pollution in its waterways.
The provision goes further by restricting lawsuits against natural
gas pipelines permitted under section 41005. The section would bar
organizations from suing for relief if even one member of the orga-
nization hadn’t suffered ‘‘direct and irreparable economic harm’’
from a pipeline permit, and it ups the standard required to set
aside a permit from ‘‘substantial’’ to ‘‘clear and convincing’’ evi-
dence. This will make it harder for Americans to compel pipeline
companies and every level of government to follow the law.
Finally, section 41007 would grant carbon dioxide, hydrogen,
crude oil, and refined petroleum products eminent domain author-
ity identical to that granted to natural gas pipelines under section
7(h) of the NGA and allow developers to ignore state and local laws
in constructing and operating such pipelines. This comes without
any Committee hearing, debate, or activity on the issue, which is
especially egregious given that Midwestern states are currently de-
bating or have enacted legislation that would prohibit the usage of
eminent domain authority at the state level for carbon dioxide
pipelines.1314
Furthermore, the section would regulate the siting of carbon di-
oxide and hydrogen pipelines similar to the siting of natural gas
pipelines by FERC, but leave the economic regulation of carbon di-
oxide and hydrogen pipelines to the Surface Transportation Board,
unlike natural gas under the NGA.15 Without the economic and
market regulatory experience, FERC would be hard-pressed to
make the requisite determination that a proposed hydrogen or car-
bon dioxide pipeline ‘‘is or will be required by the present or future
public convenience and necessity.’’16 The result, at best, would be
mass regulatory confusion, and at worst, would see landowners
across America have their property seized and spend years in liti-
gation as FERC lacks the expertise to make the required legal de-
terminations.
Sections 41002, 41003, 41005, and 41006 fundamentally dis-
mantle the permitting process for pipelines and LNG exports—the
fees the sections impose are merely incidental to that objective.
They do not represent serious attempts at permitting reform—pay-
ing someone $10 million to receive a guaranteed permit with lim-
ited ability for anyone to challenge it is not permitting reform.
Subtitle A shows a serious disregard for the domestic clean en-
ergy economy and for household energy consumers. The policies
contained in this subtitle are clearly designed to benefit Big Oil

and Gas, over all else. We believe the policies reflected in this sub-
title drag America backwards.
For the reasons stated above, we oppose Subtitle A.
Subtitle B—Environment, Providing for Reconciliation Pursuant to
H. Con. Res. 14
Subtitle B is a radical proposal that would gut critical environ-
mental protections and programs, harming the health and welfare
of all Americans. This subtitle seeks to both repeal and rescind un-
obligated funds for every single Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) program included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).17 The
bill continues the Republican majority’s political obsession with dis-
mantling the IRA. Since the law was enacted, they have targeted
these climate, clean energy, and public health programs with
countless sham hearings and so-called oversight activities. The Re-
publican majority’s own report highlights those efforts in detail.
Republicans have also tried to repeal, reprogram and claw back
these funds in multiple bills that have previously passed the
House.18 Republicans have demonstrated a clear pattern of opposi-
tion to these policies. This is just the latest example.
What’s striking is that most, if not all, of the IRA funds have al-
ready been invested in communities across the country. The sav-
ings achieved by repealing and rescinding the IRA environmental
programs is comically small—roughly 3.5 percent of the funds origi-
nally authorized for these programs, according to the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO). For example:
Section 42102, to repeal and rescind grants to reduce air pollu-
tion at ports would yield $0 in savings. The IRA invested $3 billion
to reduce air pollution at ports and in the communities that sur-
round them by financing the purchase of zero-emission port equip-
ment and technology and assisting U.S. ports in developing and im-
plementing climate action plans. Repealing the Clean Ports Pro-
gram would mean more pollution, more harm to public health—es-
pecially in frontline communities, and job losses from cutting these
important projects already underway.
Section 42108, to repeal and rescind grants for advanced biofuels
under the Renewable Fuel Program at EPA. Of the $15 million ap-
propriated under the IRA, repeal of this program would yield just
$1 million in savings.
Section 42109, to repeal and rescind funds to implement the
American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act—a bipartisan
law to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that was supported
by industry and signed by President Trump himself. The IRA ap-
propriated over $38 million to EPA for AIM implementation, and
the repeal of this section would yield only $3 million in savings,
making the budgetary impact merely incidental.
Section 42113, to repeal subsections (a) and (b) of Section 134 of
the Clean Air Act and rescind funds for the Methane Emission and
Waste Reduction Incentive Program. The IRA established the
Methane Emissions Reduction Program to control excess methane
pollution from the oil and gas industry. It recognizes the cleanest

performers, holds individual companies responsible for their own
leaks and wasted methane pollution, drives innovation in the sec-
tor, creates good-paying jobs, and supports projects to protect
American communities from the effects of climate change. The pro-
gram provided $1.55 billion in grants to assist industry with reduc-
ing current and legacy methane emissions—a far cry from the $150
million on savings CBO estimates will result from its repeal. Fur-
thermore, Republicans have made the Methane Emissions Reduc-
tion Program a frequent target of their legislative ire, trying to re-
peal the program or rescind its funds multiple times in the last few
years.19
Section 42114 would repeal and rescind funds for Climate Pollu-
tion Reduction Grants (CPRG), which provides grants to states,
municipalities, and Indian Tribes to develop and implement plans
to reduce climate pollution and support jobs in communities. The
program has been tremendously popular, with grants supporting
state, local, and Tribal governments in nearly all 50 states. All
told, this section is anticipated to yield only $70 million in savings,
out of the $5 billion authorized for the program.
Other political targets of Subtitle B include:
Section 42101, to repeal and rescind grants for clean heavy-duty
vehicles would yield $382 in cost savings, compared to the $1 bil-
lion provided in the IRA for replacing heavy-duty vehicles—like
refuse trucks and school buses—with zero emission vehicles. As
outlined in the Republican majority report, programs to support
clean vehicle deployment are a consistent focus of their political
oversight activities.
Section 42103, to repeal section 134 of the Clean Air Act and re-
scind unobligated funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund
(GGRF). The Republican majority has a longstanding political ven-
detta against GGRF, having attempted to repeal it three times—
even before the program was established and money awarded. Re-
publicans have also held multiple hearings and sent several over-
sight letters to the agency, demonizing the program.20 The budg-
etary significance of this provision is questionable as only $19 mil-
lion is available out of the entire $27 billion appropriated. This re-
maining money is allocated for administrative purposes. Recission
of such funds will impact EPA’s ability to conduct oversight. Dur-
ing Committee consideration, Democratic Members offered an
amendment to ensure that this section would not adversely affect
American families by increasing costs. GGRF is projected to have

significant economic benefits, including consumer energy cost sav-
ings of $52 billion over the next 20 years.21 Every
Section 42106, to repeal and rescind grants to reduce air pollu-
tion in schools would yield only $12 million in savings. The IRA
funded air monitoring and programs to reduce air pollution at
schools in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Over 100
million Americans live in counties with unhealthy levels of air pol-
lution, with children, the elderly, low-income communities, and
communities of color being disproportionately at risk.22 Children
are more susceptible to air pollution and poor air quality is proven
to affect children’s learning and performance at school.23 During
the markup, Democrats offered an amendment to strike this sec-
tion, yet Republicans rejected it, disagreeing with the policy intent
of the program and claiming that the funding does not help reduce
exposure. However, Republicans cannot rewrite facts. EPA has re-
ceived more applications to address indoor air quality in schools
than they can award, showing significant interest in improving
school air quality and significant need for resources across the
country.24 While Republicans may consider air pollution monitoring
and pollution control an extreme policy, recission of such funds
only hurts American children.
Section 42117, to repeal and rescind funds for the Environmental
and Climate Justice Block Grants. The IRA invested $3 billion for
community-led projects that address environmental and public
health harms related to pollution and climate change. Without this
program, projects in Republican and Democratic districts like resil-
iency hubs for natural disaster centers, renewable energy invest-
ments in low-income communities to lower energy costs, water con-
tamination testing, and air pollution reduction measures, would
not have been possible. During the markup, Democrats offered an
amendment to prevent the recission of funds for projects that im-
prove health outcomes in low-income communities. In arguing
against this commonsense amendment, Republicans members
opined on the value and purpose of environmental justice policies,
demonstrating the clear non-budgetary intention of this section.
Subtitle B also repeals and rescinds a number of smaller IRA
funded programs that help cut pollution, address climate change,
and protect public health, specifically: Section 42104 which seeks
to repeal and rescind funds for DERA grants to cut dirty diesel pol-
lution from goods movement operations; Section 42105 which would
repeal funds for various air pollution monitoring activities under
Sections 103 and 105 of the Clean Air Act; Section 42107 which
seeks to repeal and rescind Clean Air Act section 135 the Low
Emissions Electricity Program; Section 42110 which seeks to repeal
and rescind funds for enforcement technology upgrades at EPA;
Section 42111 which repeals and rescinds funds meant to enhance

ments; Sections 42112 and 42116, which repeal and rescind funds
for Environmental Product Declaration assistance and low em-
bodied carbon labeling for construction materials, to enhance the
standardization and transparency and increase competitiveness of
domestic manufacturing; and Section 42115, to repeal and rescind
funds to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of envi-
ronmental reviews, permitting, and project approvals.
Beyond the IRA, Sections 42201 and 42301 propose to repeal
clean vehicle standards finalized by EPA and the National High-
way Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), jeopardizing air qual-
ity and domestic manufacturing, giving a leg up to the fossil fuel
industry.25 In terms of cost savings, these two provisions are re-
dundant, and both double count savings associated with repealing
the IRA’s EV tax credits.
The Republican majority’s ham-handed attempt to use the budg-
et reconciliation process to repeal policies they disagree with is
abundantly clear. When Congress passed the IRA, we made a crit-
ical and historic down payment toward a stable climate and shared
economic opportunity powered by American-made clean energy, to
create a clean future for all. But this bill proposes to throw that
all away by eliminating the environmental protections that keep
families and communities safe while doing nothing to lower energy
costs. All in the service of providing tax breaks for billionaires.
For the reasons stated above, we oppose Subtitle B.
Subtitle C—Communications, Providing for Reconciliation
Pursuant to H. Con. Res. 14
PART 1—SPECTRUM AUCTIONS
Spectrum is a valuable natural resource because it is an essen-
tial building block for connecting family and friends as well as de-
livering critical services such as education and health care to peo-
ple across the country. It is also critical to everyday safety for first
responders. Without spectrum, this country would not have radio
stations, smartphones, the app economy, or drones. Many of these
technological advancements were developed by American
innovators, pushing the limits on the ways spectrum could be used
in new and exciting ways. But past performance does not guar-
antee future results. As such, Congressional Democrats remain
committed to ensuring that America remain a leader in spectrum
policy.
To that end, for more than three decades, Congress has granted
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the authority to
make spectrum available using competitive bidding, or auctions.
Granting the FCC this authority has served both the public and
the nation well. Today, the United States is a global leader in de-
livering 5G, advanced Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other next-generation
wireless technologies to consumers across the country. At the same
time, spectrum auctions, which have raised over $230 billion for
the federal government, have helped fund important public commu-
nications priorities, including the Rip and Replace reimbursement
2589 Fed. Reg. 27842, 89 Fed. Reg. 52540.

program, the construction of FirstNet, and broadband infrastruc-
ture grants. This is why spectrum policy has long been an area of
bipartisan agreement. In fact, Congressional Democrats have
worked closely with Congressional Republicans for the past three
years to pass bills through this Committee to extend the FCC’s
auction authority and use spectrum proceeds to pay for bipartisan
spending priorities that will benefit the public good.
One of the most recent areas of bipartisan agreement was the
need to fund Next Generation 9–1–1. This funding would mod-
ernize the country’s 9–1–1 networks to allow the public to use mod-
ern day communications tools like sending texts, images, and vid-
eos to first responders and emergency personnel. This technology
will reduce response times and equip first responders with life-sav-
ing information before they arrive at the scene, which will better
assist people in their critical time of need. Unfortunately, with
Subtitle C, Part 1, Congressional Republicans are now abandoning
this bipartisan work and marching ahead to use spectrum auction
proceeds to help fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Congressional
Democrats do not believe this is how spectrum auction proceeds
should be used.
Ultimately, while Congressional Democrats agree that failure to
make additional spectrum available for commercial wireless use
risks our nation falling behind our global counterparts, particularly
China, Congressional Democrats object to using spectrum auction
proceeds to fund tax cuts that only benefit a few instead of invest-
ing in all Americans regardless of their income or zip code.
PART 2—ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
MODERNIZATION
Subsection (a) of Section 43201 of the bill, appropriates $500 mil-
lion to the Department of Commerce to modernize and secure fed-
eral information technology (IT) systems. Subsection (b) authorizes
the funds to be spent to replace and modernize the Department of
Commerce’s legacy business systems with commercial artificial in-
telligence (AI) and automated decision systems, to facilitate the de-
velopment of AI models that increase operational efficiency and
service delivery, and to improve the cyber security of IT systems
within the Department of Commerce. Modernizing the Department
of Commerce’s IT systems, incorporating AI into those systems, and
improving the agency’s cybersecurity protections are worthwhile
goals, but the Committee has had no hearings to explore IT mod-
ernization, AI adoption, or cybersecurity needs of the Department
of Commerce’s IT system, and it is therefore impossible to assess
whether the amount of money appropriated or the scope of the au-
thorization are appropriate or whether these provisions are unnec-
essarily throwing $500 million at unexplored issues; thereby invit-
ing waste, fraud and abuse from the Big Technology companies
likely to bid on the projects.
Subsection (c) of Section 43201 is wholly unrelated to IT mod-
ernization, AI adoption, and cybersecurity protections of the IT sys-
tems at the Department of Commerce provided for in subsections
(a) and (b). Subsection (c) imposes an extraordinary 10-year mora-
torium on state and local enforcement of their own laws regulating
AI models, AI systems, or automated decision-making systems. The

Department of Commerce’s IT modernization efforts are not subject
to state and local laws in any way and therefore would not be im-
peded by enforcement of the state and local laws this moratorium
would suspend. This provision is a gift to Big Tech and extraor-
dinarily harmful to all Americans. It would prevent enforcement of
state laws that protect consumers’ privacy, prohibit the use of AI
to commit financial fraud and to steal elections, prohibit algo-
rithmic bias in housing and credit, prohibit harmful uses of facial
recognition technology, and protect consumers from AI systems
that put their mental health and physical safety at risk. It would
favor companies that use AI and automated decision making to ex-
ploit consumers for profit over honest small businesses using AI for
legitimate purposes. It would also prevent enforcement of state
laws and regulations governing the use of AI by local and state
governments for all sorts of beneficial purposes including rules gov-
erning local school districts and their procurement of education
technology powered by automated decision making systems; use
and evaluation of AI systems by state and local police departments;
and even use of AI and automated decision making systems that
assist in identifying attempts to defraud programs funded by state
and local governments. This state enforcement ban would occur at
a time when Congress has passed a very limited set of law to ad-
dress potential risks to consumers.
The Committee has heard testimony that AI and automated deci-
sion-making systems and tools can have enormous benefits, and
that they carry enormous risks. There are countless examples of AI
systems that provide false information, erode consumers’ privacy,
unjustifiably discriminate against people in employment, housing,
credit, and countless other situations.
There are regular reports of AI systems used to further financial
scams and election fraud, and of online algorithms that put con-
sumers’, including children’s and teens’, mental and physical safety
at risk. At a minimum, in the absence of robust federal action to
prevent the harmful effects of AI, Congress should be learning from
the work done by states on AI and automated decision-making sys-
tems. We should be working to enact federal laws that protect con-
sumers from the negative consequences of poorly understood AI
models and badly designed automated decision-making systems.
And we should allow states and localities to decide how to regulate
their own use of AI and automated decision-making systems. In-
stead, this enforcement ban would leave American consumers and
especially our children at the mercy of Big Tech and their powerful
and invasive algorithms by preventing enforcement of existing
state laws and providing nothing in their place.
For the reasons stated above, we oppose Subtitle C.
Subtitle D—Health, providing for reconciliation pursuant to
H. Con. Res. 14
Subtitle D raises deep concerns about the effects that it would
have on health coverage for the nearly 80 million people who rely
on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the
more than 24 million people who rely on Affordable Care Act (ACA)

Marketplace.26 Further, Subtitle D would have devastating effects
the on the entire nation’s health care safety net—leading to hos-
pital, nursing home, home- and community-based provider, and
outpatient clinic closures, as well as reductions in services, impact-
ing all Americans’ access to care. Taken together, Subtitle D evis-
cerates health coverage, state budget flexibility, and provider pay-
ments, and will have a catastrophic effect on our economy, jobs,
and Americans’ health and well-being as the nation heads toward
an increasingly likely Trump recession.27
Subtitle D would itself leave 8.6 million Americans who rely on
Medicaid and the ACA Marketplace for their health care entirely
uninsured. When coupled with Subtitle D’s omission of an exten-
sion to current-law enhanced Advance Premium Tax Credits
(APTCs) that enable low- and middle-income Americans to access
affordable health coverage on the ACA Marketplaces, 13.7 million
Americans would be left uninsured. Coverage losses for the 7.6 mil-
lion people expected to lose Medicaid coverage stem in large part
from provisions that add myriad administrative complexities to the
already-burdensome process that low-income Americans must com-
ply with to access health coverage through Medicaid.
Section 44141 mandates that all states establish work reporting
requirements as a condition of Medicaid eligibility—terminating
health coverage for those who are currently enrolled in Medicaid
and do not manage to comply with the reporting requirements and
preventing those who cannot meet the requirements from ever en-
rolling. The design of these burdensome red tape requirements is
much like the design of Georgia’s program, through which a mea-
ger 7,000 people have managed to enroll in the nearly two years
it has been in effect out of hundreds of thousands of eligible to en-
roll in the program.2829 CBO estimates that these paperwork re-
quirements alone would eliminate health coverage for nearly 5 mil-
lion low-income Americans subjected to them—leaving them unin-
sured. The reporting requirements apply to the more than 20 mil-
lion Americans enrolled in Medicaid through the ACA Medicaid ex-
pansion eligibility group, encompassing adults ages 19–65 who
qualify for Medicaid based on their low (https://gbpi.org/georgias-
pathways-to-coverage-program-the-first-year-in-review/). income (up
to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or, in the case of a one-
person household, making less than $1,760 per month).3031

The low-income Americans to whom these reporting require-
ments would apply include pregnant women,3233 low-income par-
ents,3435 people with disabilities,36 veterans,3738 low-income work-
ers without access to affordable employer-sponsored insurance,39
and people with complex medical conditions and health needs, in-
cluding those with mental health and substance use disorder treat-
ment needs.40 While the text includes exceptions for some (but not
all) of these groups of people from the requirements to participate
in qualifying activities like working 80 hours per month, to receive
such an exception, most individuals would be required to dem-
onstrate that they qualify for the exceptions. From experience in
every state that has implemented or began to implement a work
reporting requirement at the state level, these exceptions have not
worked.414243
Making matters even more devastating for the low-income Amer-
icans who would lose their Medicaid coverage due to these paper-
work requirements, Section 44141 further punishes them by bar-
ring them from subsidies on the ACA Marketplace—leaving those
who could otherwise purchase subsidized health care coverage with
no other affordable health coverage option at all. In this report, Re-
publicans attempt to justify these work reporting requirements by
indicating that ‘‘Medicare beneficiaries are only eligible for the pro-
gram because they worked and paid into the system,’’ yet no such
work reporting requirement applies to Medicare eligibility.44

is Section 44108, which requires individuals eligible for Medicaid
via the ACA Medicaid expansion to complete eligibility redeter-
minations every six months—on top of up-to-monthly reporting of
compliance with Medicaid work reporting requirements. Increasing
the frequency of eligibility verifications would decimate health cov-
erage gains and increase enrollment churn and undermine recent
initiatives to provide longer enrollment periods for eligible Ameri-
cans in recognition of the coverage and cost impacts of frequent, in-
effective verifications of eligibility.4546
In the same vein, sections 44101 and 44102 would prevent imple-
mentation or enforcement until 2035 of two rules finalized by the
Biden Administration to simplify eligibility and enrollment proc-
esses for the lowest-income Medicare beneficiaries who also rely on
Medicaid for coverage, people with disabilities, and children eligible
for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)—cutting 2.3
million of them off of Medicaid coverage they rely on to help pay
for their prescriptions and go to the doctor, and leaving 600,000 of
them entirely uninsured.47 Elimination of these rules also subject
children eligible for CHIP to months-long waiting periods, arbitrary
caps on covered benefits (based on lifetime and annual dollar lim-
its), and allow children to be locked out of their health coverage
after a period of non-payment of premiums.48
In this report, Republicans attempt to justify their cuts by falsely
claiming that ‘‘the growth in total Medicaid spending and enroll-
ment is a growing concern as it impedes the program’s ability to
provide care for those vulnerable populations who rely most on
Medicaid,’’ suggesting that terminating coverage for people eligible
thanks to the ACA Medicaid expansion would somehow increase
funds to provide coverage to individuals who are eligible through
other pathways. In reality, not one provision of Subtitle D would
make Medicaid eligibility or benefits more generous for any person.
Further, research has consistently and clearly demonstrated that
eligibility for children, pregnant women, and parents is higher in
expansion states compared to non-expansion states and that Med-
icaid spending per-enrollee is higher in expansion states than non-
expansion states.49 Further, state spending on Medicaid expansion
is, on average, less than three percent of all state spending on
Medicaid, despite Medicaid expansion representing 23 percent of

all Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.5051 In many cases, Medicaid
expansion generates enough savings and/or new revenue to more
than offset a state’s share of the cost, and states have even used
the budget savings generated by expansion to further improve ac-
cess to services for people with disabilities, including long-term
care services.5253
In addition to terminating health coverage for 8.6 million Ameri-
cans, Subtitle D includes several provisions that would increase
out-of-pocket costs and medical debt and devastate access to care
for low-income American families and seniors. For example, Section
44122 reduces the period of time for which all Medicaid bene-
ficiaries can receive retroactive coverage from three months prior
to application to just one. As an example, this provision harms el-
derly Americans whose health declines rapidly and unexpectedly
need to apply for Medicaid to receive coverage for long-term care
(which Medicare does not provide). Iowa previously waived retro-
active eligibility and nursing homes refused to take new residents
while their Medicaid applications were still pending and, in Indi-
ana, retroactive coverage protected low-income parents from in-
curred costs averaging $1,561 per person.54
Subtitle D also would prohibit federal Medicaid funding for
Planned Parenthood and its affiliates across the country. Section
44126 creates a specific and narrow definition intended to target
certain providers in the Medicaid program that separately, and
without federal Medicaid funding, provide abortion services. As a
result, these providers would no longer be able to serve Medicaid
beneficiaries or provide routine preventive and reproductive health
care services in the Medicaid program, including contraception
counseling and birth control, breast and cervical cancer screenings
and pap smears, sexually transmitted infection (STI) screenings,
and preconception counseling. Even in the nearly two-dozen states
that have outlawed or severely restricted abortion care, Medicaid
beneficiaries would be unable to seek care at Planned Parenthood
as a result of this provision. Millions of Medicaid beneficiaries
would be left without the ability to seek care from their provider
of choice solely because of the Republicans’ hostility towards
Planned Parenthood and the ability for women to seek comprehen-
sive reproductive health care.
As these and similar provisions dramatically heighten rates of
uninsurance and uncompensated care for providers, Subtitle D

cripples states’ ability to finance their Medicaid programs or ade-
quately increase payment rates to already-struggling providers.55
Section 44132 establishes a moratorium on new or increased pro-
vider taxes, which states use along with general funds to finance
their Medicaid programs. Without the ability to generate new pro-
vider taxes, states would reduce payment rates to providers (which
will already have higher uncompensated care), cut back on the ben-
efits they provide (for the people who remain enrolled in the pro-
gram), and further reduce coverage.56 As acknowledged by Repub-
lican majority counsel during the Committee’s markup of Subtitle
D, this moratorium on new and increased provider taxes would
apply regardless of the state’s circumstances or the purpose of the
provider tax. For example, a state could not increase or establish
new provider taxes to generate revenue to support the Medicaid
program if uncompensated care costs increase given the 13.7 mil-
lion people expected to become uninsured; if there is an economic
downturn, when Medicaid spending tends to grow and state gen-
eral fund revenues decrease; if a natural disaster like a hurricane
hits, or if the state would like to improve access for home- and com-
munity-based services that elderly Americans and people with dis-
abilities, including children, rely on to live in their homes and com-
munities (and for which such people are currently subjected to
years-long and even decades-long waiting lists).57 Section 44133
would further devastate states’ ability to shore up providers that
will see a dramatic increase in uncompensated care due to this rec-
onciliation bill, by preventing states from directing managed care
plans to make payments to providers at the same levels they are
permitted to make them today.
Section 44201 will make it more difficult for individuals to enroll
in coverage in the ACA Marketplace, will take away coverage from
eligible individuals, and will increase consumers’ health care costs.
Provisions in Section 44201 will result in at least 1.8 million indi-
viduals losing their health insurance. The section codifies harmful
policies included in the 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Afford-
ability Proposed Rule released by the Trump Administration on
March 10, 2025.58 According to the Trump Administration’s own
analysis of the policies in the proposed rule, two million Americans
will lose coverage, and consumers will experience $3 billion in-

crease in their premiums over four years.59 The provisions in Sec-
tion 44201 will impose new restrictions on the lowest income indi-
viduals accessing coverage, new bureaucratic paperwork require-
ments, and increased out-of-pocket costs for consumers.
Section 44201 will shorten the open enrollment period to just six
weeks and will eliminate special enrollment periods for low-income
Americans. Both policies will depress ACA Marketplace enrollment,
raise health care costs for millions of consumers, and make it hard-
er for the lowest-income families to enroll in coverage who experi-
ence job changes or income fluctuations. The section also includes
several policies related to enrollment verification, which the Trump
Administration concedes will establish enrollment barriers and
deter Marketplace enrollment. Multiple polices in this section re-
lated to income verification will create barriers to coverage and in-
crease consumer burden by increasing the amount of time it takes
people to get enrolled in coverage. These policies will mostly harm
low-income families and individuals with variable or unpredictable
incomes, such as small business owners and self-employed individ-
uals. As a result of the substantial increase in burden, fewer
healthy people would enroll, worsening the risk pool, and raising
premiums for everyone.
Multiple policies in Section 44201 will raise costs for consumers
by increasing premiums and cost-sharing and reducing the tax
credit that helps make coverage affordable. A provision in Section
44201 will require individuals who are automatically reenrolled in
zero-dollar premium plans to pay nuisance fees. Both auto-enroll-
ment and zero-premium plans are meant to support lower income
workers and their families. Even a nominal fee applied to this will
make it difficult for these individuals to continue to afford health
coverage. The section would also prohibit individuals who qualify
for more generous coverage from being automatically re-enrolled
into a higher quality plan, and only harms consumers by pre-
venting them from accessing better coverage at a lower cost. Fi-
nally, the section makes changes to the methodology for deter-
mining the premium adjustment percentage and includes changes
to the allowable variation in actuarial value (AV). This will result
in higher out-of-pocket costs for commercially insured Americans—
including those with employer-sponsored insurance—and lower tax
credits for individuals purchasing coverage on their own. Addition-
ally, it will allow insurers to offer weaker coverage which reduces
affordability and raises out-of-pocket costs for American families.
In summary, policies in Section 44201 will result in more Ameri-
cans uninsured, worsen coverage for individuals purchasing cov-
erage on their own, and will raise health care costs for millions of
individuals.
Lastly, assertions that enrollees in Marketplace coverage en-
gaged in fraud are factually inaccurate. Any fraudulent activity in
the Marketplace was perpetrated by rogue insurance agents and
other bad actors—not individual health coverage enrollees. The
Biden Administration quickly clamped down on the problem, and
in fact, the Biden Administration blocked two bad acting brokers

from accessing consumer information as it was found that they
were involved in ‘anomalous activity.’ Instead of going after the
true fraud, the Trump Administration fired 80 workers from the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) group that over-
sees implementation of these Marketplaces, effectively gutting re-
sources from the people tasked with cracking down on true fraud
in the first place. More importantly none of the policies in Section
44201 address fraud by agents and brokers, and instead only seek
to punish individuals who need health insurance by heaping bu-
reaucracy and red tape on them.
While the Republican majority claims Subtitle D will ‘‘address
the rising costs of prescription medications for seniors in Medicare
. . .,’’ in reality, it directly raises costs. In addition to the detri-
mental cuts to the Medicaid program and the ACA, Subtitle D also
undermines the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program that
was established in the Inflation Reduction Act and, for the first
time, provided the Secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) with the authority and mandate to nego-
tiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower the price of pre-
scription drugs in the Medicare program. This provision would ex-
pand the drugs eligible for exclusion from the Negotiation Program
under 1192(e) of the Social Security Act by permitting drugs with
multiple rare disease indications to be exempt from selection as a
negotiation-eligible drug. This was not the intent of the provision
when the Inflation Reduction was enacted and will only serve to
prevent more beneficiaries, particularly those with rare diseases,
from obtaining lower drug prices in the Medicare program.
Additionally, the provision permits pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers to potentially have years or even decades longer on the market
before being selected for negotiation by changing the calculation for
the amount of time elapsed prior to negotiation. Should a drug
product or biological product’s first indication on the market be for
a rare disease, that time will not be taken into account for the pur-
poses of calculating the 9- or 13-year delay, respectively, required
under law before a Maximum Fair Price can go into effect. As a re-
sult, manufacturers will be able to game this provision to maximize
the amount of time on the market prior to their drug being poten-
tially negotiation-eligible. This provision costs taxpayers nearly $5
billion and costs many Medicare beneficiaries years of higher pre-
scription drug prices. Section 44301 is a giant gift for the pharma-
ceutical industry, resulting in continued higher prescription drug
costs for the American people.
For the reasons stated above, we oppose Section D and this en-
tire bill.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H. Con. Res. 14, Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal
Year 2025, directs 11 authorizing committees in the House of Rep-
resentatives to each submit to the Committee on the Budget rec-
ommendations that either increase the deficit up to a specified
amount or reduce the deficit by at least a specified amount over the
period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034. The Committee on Ways
and Means is also instructed to submit changes in laws within its
jurisdiction to increase the debt limit.
H. Con. Res. 14 instructs the Financial Services Committee to
submit changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the deficit
by not less than $1,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2025
through 2034. Accordingly, the Committee Print being considered

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 50001. Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multi-
family Family Housing
Section 50001 rescinds the unobligated balance of amounts re-
maining under section 300002(a) of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Section 50002. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
Section 50002 eliminates the Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board’s (PCAOB) authority to independently collect and
spend accounting support fees and instead directs that such fees be
remitted to the U.S. Treasury. The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC) would continue these responsibilities and further fee
collection would be discontinued.
Section 50003. Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
Section 50003 modifies the Consumer Financial Protection
Board’s authority to draw funds from the Federal Reserve to a
maximum of 5 percent of the Federal Reserve’s total operating ex-
penses for fiscal year 2009 for FY 2025 and adjusting it for infla-
tion thereafter.
This section also restricts the Consumer Financial Protection
Board from holding an unobligated balance of greater than 5 per-
cent of the revised transfer amount from the Federal Reserve and
it requires any funds exceeding that percentage be transferred to
the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.
Section 50004. Consumer Financial Civil Penalty Fund
Section 50004 requires the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau to return to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury any civil
penalties remaining in the Consumer Financial Civil Penalty Fund
after payment to direct victims.
This section also removes the use of the Consumer Financial
Civil Penalty Fund for consumer education and financial literacy.
Section 50005. Financial Research Fund
Section 50005 caps assessments collected by the Office of Finan-
cial Research, limiting them to the average actual budgetary ex-

penses of the Financial Stability Oversight Council over the pre-
ceding three fiscal years and requires excess funds to be trans-
ferred to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.
This section also prohibits the Office of Financial Research from
collecting assessments that would cause the Financial Research
Fund to exceed this cap.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate for the Com-
mittee Print prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget
Office.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the above cost estimate for the
bill prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation would:
• Rescind the unobligated balances of the Green and Resil-
ient Retrofit Program
• Transfer the Public Company Accounting Board’s authori-
ties to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
eliminate the authority to collect accounting support fees to
fund the board’s activities
• Reduce the amount the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau (CFPB) may receive from the Federal Reserve and spend
for administrative activities
• Limit the uses of amounts in the Civil Penalty Fund
• Reduce the amount that the Office of Financial Research
may collect and spend in fees
• Increase the cost of an existing private-sector mandate on
certain commercial entities if the SEC increases annual fee col-
lections
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:

• Decreases in direct spending by the CFPB because of de-
creased transfer authority
• Decreases in direct spending and revenues from agencies
that collect and spend fees
Legislation summary: H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution
on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, instructed the House Com-
mittee on Financial Services to recommend legislative changes that
would decrease deficits by at least $1 billion over the 2025–2034
period. As part of the reconciliation process, the House Committee
on Financial Services approved legislation on April 30, 2025, that
would reduce deficits.
Estimated federal cost: The reconciliation recommendations of
the House Committee on Financial Services would, on net, decrease
deficits by $5.2 billion over the 2025–2034 period. The estimated
budgetary effects of the legislation are shown in Table 1. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget functions 370 (commerce and
housing credit) and 600 (income security).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legis-
lation will be enacted in summer 2025. CBO’s estimates are rel-
ative to its January 2025 baseline and cover the period from 2025
through 2034.
Direct spending and revenues: CBO estimates that enacting the
bill would decrease direct spending by $8.5 billion and decrease
revenues by $3.3 billion; the deficit would decrease by $5.2 billion
over the 2025–2034 period (see Table 2).
Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Family
Housing: Section 50001 would rescind the unobligated balances of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Green and
Resilient Retrofit Program. Using information from the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development, CBO estimates that en-
acting the rescission would decrease direct spending by $138 mil-
lion over the 2025–2034 period.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board: Section 50002
would transfer the authorities of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) to the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion (SEC) no later than one year after enactment. At the time of
that transfer, the SEC would not be permitted to collect and spend
accounting support fees authorized under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 that the PCAOB currently collects. Those fees, which fund
the board’s activities, are treated as revenues and are available to
be spent without further appropriation.
CBO expects that the board’s authorities would be transferred to
the SEC around the end of fiscal year 2026 and that, starting in
2027, accounting support fees would no longer be collected and
spent. CBO estimates that eliminating the authority to collect the
fees would decrease direct spending by $3.2 billion over the 2027–
2034 period.
Eliminating the fee authority also would reduce collections of
fees by $3.3 billion. However, reducing such fees tends to increase
taxable income for workers and businesses, leading to increased
collections of income and payroll taxes. As a result, CBO expects
that the reduction in fee collections would be partially offset by in-
creases in tax receipts of about 25 percent of the gross fee reduc-
tion each year.1 CBO estimates that, on net, revenues would de-
crease by $2.4 billion over the 2027–2034 period.
Although CBO anticipates that the SEC would collect fees of
similar magnitude to fund those activities, the collection and
spending of fees imposed by the SEC are contingent on annual ap-
propriations providing that authority to the agency. CBO has not
reviewed this legislation for effects on spending subject to appro-
priation, so any costs for the SEC to implement the legislation are
not included in this estimate.
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection: Section 50003 would
decrease the maximum amount that the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau (CFPB) may request from the Federal Reserve each
year to cover operating expenses. Under current law, the CFPB
may request a transfer of up to 12 percent of the Federal Reserve’s
operating expenses from 2009, adjusted for inflation each year be-

ginning in 2013. The provision would reduce the cap to 5 percent
of the Federal Reserve’s operating expenses in 2009, adjusted for
inflation each year beginning in 2025.
CBO expects that the new cap would take effect at the beginning
of 2026 and that the CFPB will have already received its final
quarterly funding from the Federal Reserve for 2025. CBO esti-
mates that enacting the provision would reduce transfers from the
Federal Reserve by about $4.2 billion and reduce direct spending
by $3.9 billion over the 2026–2034 period.
The Federal Reserve System transmits its net income to the
Treasury as remittances, which are recorded as revenues. Trans-
fers to the CFPB reduce those remittances but are recorded as
other miscellaneous receipts in the budget; those two revenue
streams net to zero over the 2025–2034 period. Changes in costs
for the Federal Reserve banks have historically resulted in changes
to remittances during the same year. However, since fiscal year
2023, the central bank has recorded a deferred asset to account for
accrued net losses from expenses in excess of income. As a result,
remittances have been largely suspended. In CBO’s projections, re-
mittances from the Federal Reserve will generally be suspended
until 2030, and most of the changes in costs incurred by the system
during that time will not be recorded as a change in remittances
until they resume.2
Consumer Financial Civil Penalty Fund: Section 50004 would
prohibit the CFPB from spending amounts in the Civil Penalty
Fund for any purpose other than to pay victims of violations of con-
sumer financial law for which penalties have been imposed. Under
current law, the CFPB deposits penalties collected from judicial or
administrative actions into the Civil Penalty Fund; in addition to
paying victims of violations, the CFPB uses those amounts for con-
sumer education and financial literacy programs.
Under current rules, the CFPB may use amounts associated with
one penalty to pay victims associated with another penalty. This
provision would effectively prohibit that practice and also would
bar the CFPB from spending amounts on consumer education or fi-
nancial literacy programs. Based on an analysis of the amounts re-
turned to the fund in recent years and using other information
from the CFPB, CBO expects that enacting this provision would re-
duce direct spending by $9 million over the 2025–2034 period.
Financial Research Fund: Section 50005 would cap assessments
collected by the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and deposited
into the Financial Research Fund at a three-year moving average
of the expenses of the Financial Stability Oversight Council
(FSOC). Under current law, the OFR collects assessments from
large financial institutions to fund its operations and the oper-
ations of the FSOC. Those assessments are recorded as revenues
and are available to be spent without future appropriation. CBO
estimates that enacting the provision would decrease direct spend-
ing on OFR and FSOC activities by $1.2 billion.
Capping assessments also would reduce revenues by $1.2 billion.
However, reducing such fees tends to increase taxable income for

workers and businesses, leading to increased collections of income
and payroll taxes. As a result, CBO expects that the reduction in
fee collections would be partially offset by increases in tax receipts
of about 25 percent of the gross fee reduction each year. On net,
CBO estimates that revenues would decrease by $906 million
under this provision.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-
you-go procedures are shown in Table 1.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting the legislation would not increase net direct
spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-
year periods beginning in 2035.
Mandates: If the SEC increases fees to offset the costs associated
with implementing provisions in section 50002 of the reconciliation
recommendations of the House Financial Services Committee, the
legislation would increase the cost of an existing mandate on pri-
vate entities required to pay those assessments. CBO estimates
that the cost of the mandate would exceed the annual threshold for
private-sector mandates established in the Unfunded Mandates Re-
form Act (UMRA) ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for in-
flation).
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: David Hughes (for the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau, Financial Research Fund, and
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board); Zunara Naeem
(for the Department of Housing Urban Development). Revenues:
David Hughes (for the Financial Research Fund and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board); Nathaniel Frentz (for the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). Mandates: Rachel Austin.

ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Joshua Shakin, Chief,

tor of Budget Analysis; H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis; Chad Chirico, Director of Budget Analysis.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
The findings and recommendations of the Committee, based on
oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, are incorporated in the descriptive por-
tions of this report.
COMMITTEE VOTES
On April 30, 2025, the Committee Print was ordered to be trans-
mitted to the House Committee on the Budget by a recorded vote
of 30 ayes to 22 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No.
FC–100).
The Committee considered the following amendments to the
Committee Print:
• Chairman Hill (R–AR) offered an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute, which made minor edits and technical
changes. The amendment was adopted by a voice vote.—
• Representative Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an amend-
ment (EHVSAMND) that would strike Sec. 50001 and replace
it with an increase in new mandatory spending in an amount
necessary to fund 60,000 emergency housing vouchers under
the program created by Sec. 3202 of Public Law #117–2. The
amendment was defeated in a recorded vote of 21 yeas and 28
nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–064).
• Representative Waters offered an amendment (HCRA)
that would strike the text Sec. 50001 and replace it with a
modified version of the text of H.R. 4233, the Housing Crisis
Response Act of 2023, from the 118th Congress. The amend-
ment was defeated in a recorded vote of 21 yeas and 29 nays,
a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–065).
• Representative Nydia Vela´zquez (D–NY) offered an
amendment (VELAZQ_021) that would strike the text Sec.
50001 and replace it with an increase of $90 billion in new

ceives under subsection (d) shall be deposited into the Finan-
cial Research Fund.

gations that are guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States, with maturities suitable to the needs of
the Financial Research Fund, as determined by the Direc-
tor.
(4) INTEREST AND PROCEEDS CREDITED.—The interest on, and
the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations
held in the Financial Research Fund shall be credited to and
form a part of the Financial Research Fund.
(b) USE OF FUNDS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Funds obtained by, transferred to, or cred-
ited to the Financial Research Fund shall be immediately
available to the Office, and shall remain available until ex-
pended, to pay the expenses of the Office in carrying out the
duties and responsibilities of the Office.
(2) FEES, ASSESSMENTS, AND OTHER FUNDS NOT GOVERNMENT
FUNDS.—Funds obtained by, transferred to, or credited to the
Financial Research Fund shall not be construed to be Govern-
ment funds or appropriated moneys.

standing any other provision of law, amounts in the Financial

ing companies with total consolidated assets of $250,000,000,0001
or greater and nonbank financial companies supervised by the
Board of Governors, that takes into account differences among such
companies, based on the considerations for establishing the pruden-
tial standards under section 115, to collect assessments equal to
the total expenses of the Office.
(e) LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS AND THE FINANCIAL RESEARCH
FUND.—
(1) LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS.—Assessments may not be
collected under subsection (d) if the assessments would result
in—
(A) the Financial Research Fund exceeding the average
annual budget amount; or
(B) the total assessments collected during a single fiscal
year exceeding the average annual budget amount.
(2) TRANSFER OF EXCESS FUNDS.—Any amounts in the Finan-
cial Research Fund exceeding the average annual budget
amount shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treas-
ury.
(3) AVERAGE ANNUAL BUDGET AMOUNT DEFINED.—In this sub-
section the term ‘average annual budget amount’ means the
annual average, over the 3 most recently completed fiscal
years, of the expenses of the Council in carrying out the duties
and responsibilities of the Council that were paid by the Office
using amounts obtained through assessments under subsection
(d).
1Effective November 24, 2019, pursuant to section 401(c)(1)(D) and (d)(1) of Public Law 115–
174, section 155(d) is amended by striking ‘‘50,000,000,000’’ and inserting ‘‘$250,000,000,000’’.
Subsection (d)(2) of such section 401 also states as follows: ‘‘Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the
amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act with
respect to any bank holding company with total consolidated assets of less than
$100,000,000,000’’. There is a discrepancy between the Statutes-At-Large and the enrolled bill
versions as it relates to the dollar symbol (see Codification note @ 12 U.S.C. 5345).
The text of the Statute-At-Large text is incorrect, as the law signed by the President included
a dollar symbol (as so enrolled). Therefore, the above reflects the execution of the amendment
made by Public Law 115–174 to the enrolled version.

DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
The Committee states that no provision of the Committee Print
establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Government
known to be duplicative of another Federal program, including any
program that was included in a report to Congress pursuant to sec-
tion 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance.
COMMITTEE VIEWS
SECTION 50001: HUD’S GREEN AND RESILIENT RETROFIT PROGRAM
FUNDING
Section 50001 rescinds any remaining unobligated balances with
the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD)
Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, created under Section 30002
of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Background
Section 30002 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 appropriated
$1 billion in new, mandatory spending to HUD for a Green and Re-
silient Retrofit Program (GRRP). The GRRP was designed to make
grants and direct loans to the owners of HUD-subsidized properties
to support energy efficiency and climate change resilience projects.
Projects eligible for GRRP funding include: improving energy or
water efficiency; enhancing indoor air quality or sustainability; im-
plementing the use of zero-emission electricity generation, low-
emission building materials or processes, energy storage, or build-
ing electrification strategies; and addressing climate resilience. The
Biden administration executed 12 rounds of obligating funding
under the program, with the final round of funding coming in No-
vember 2024.
SECTION 50002: PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD
(PCAOB)
Section 50002 eliminates the PCAOB’s authority to independ-
ently collect and spend accounting support fees and instead directs
that all such fees be remitted to the U.S. Treasury after a transi-
tion period. The SEC would continue these responsibilities using
funds appropriated by Congress, and further fee collection under
Section 109 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (‘‘Sarbanes-Oxley’’)
would be discontinued.
Background
The PCAOB is a non-profit corporation Congress established to
oversee the audits of public companies. The PCAOB’s responsibil-
ities include: (1) registering public accounting firms; (2) estab-
lishing auditing, quality control, ethics, independence, and other
standards relating to public company audits; (3) conducting inspec-

tions, investigations, and disciplinary proceedings of registered ac-
counting firms; and (4) enforcing compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley.1
The PCAOB was established as part of Sarbanes-Oxley in re-
sponse to various accounting scandals of the late 1990s (i.e., Enron,
WorldCom, the collapse of Arthur Anderson). Prior to its creation,
the accounting profession was self-regulated. Sarbanes-Oxley pro-
vided the SEC the authority to oversee the PCAOB’s operations,
appoint or remove members, approve the PCAOB’s budget and
rules, and entertain appeals of any PCAOB inspection reports or
disciplinary actions.2 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (‘‘Dodd-Frank’’) established the current
funding regime for the PCAOB, which is done primarily through
annual accounting support fees. These fees are assessed on public
companies (based on their relative average monthly market capital-
ization) and on broker-dealers (based on their relative average
quarterly tentative net capital).
SECTION 50003: CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB)
FUNDING
Section 50003 modifies CFPB’s authority to draw funds from the
Federal Reserve to a maximum of 5 percent of the Federal Re-
serve’s total operating expenses for fiscal year 2009, which were
$4.98 billion,3 and adjusting it for inflation thereafter. This would
replace the current cap of 12 percent. Additionally, the CFPB
would be restricted to holding an unobligated balance no greater
than 5 percent of the revised transfer amount ($12.45 million for
2025) from the Federal Reserve. Any funds exceeding that percent-
age would be required to be transferred to the general fund of the
U.S. Treasury.
Background
The CFPB was established under Title X of Dodd-Frank as a cen-
tralized federal agency to implement and enforce consumer finan-
cial laws.4 Prior to the CFPB’s creation, these responsibilities were
dispersed across seven federal agencies, each with a primary statu-
tory mission.5 Under section 1017 of Dodd Frank, the Federal Re-
serve Board is required to transfer from the combined earnings6 of
the Federal Reserve System7 to the CFPB an amount ‘‘determined
by the Director to be reasonably necessary to carry out the authori-
ties of the Bureau under Federal consumer financial law,’’8 up to

tem since 2022 means that transfers since then are improper and should be struck down by
the courts. See Hal S. Scott, Understanding the CFPB’s Funding Problem, Comm. on Cap. Mkt.

a cap of 12 percent of Federal Reserve System’s total operating ex-
penses for 2009, adjusted annually for inflation.9
Transfers from the Board were capped at $734.0 million in FY
2022, at $750.9 million in FY 2023, $785.4 million in FY 2024, and
$823.1 million in FY 2025.10 Both the Federal Reserve and the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are expressly pro-
hibited from reviewing or scrutinizing the Bureau’s funding re-
quests, and the Fed is legally obligated to transfer the funds upon
request.11
SECTION 50004: CFPB CIVIL PENALTY FUND (CPF)
Section 50004 requires the CFPB to return to the general fund
of the U.S. Treasury any civil penalties remaining in the CPF after
payment to direct victims.
This section also removes the use of the CPF for consumer edu-
cation and financial literacy.
Background
Under current law, when the CFPB obtains a civil penalty
through judicial or administrative action under federal consumer fi-
nancial laws, the collected penalties are deposited into the CPF.
These funds are available to the CFPB—without fiscal year limita-
tion—for payments to victims harmed by the underlying violations.
Significantly, the CFPB may commingle civil penalties in the CPF
and routinely uses penalties from one company to compensate vic-
tims of activities of a different company. If the CFPB determines
it cannot locate the victims or finds that payments are not prac-
9Under Sec. 1017 of Dodd-Frank, after 2012, the CFPB’s funding cap annually adjusts using
the percent increase in the employment cost index for total compensation for State and local
government workers.

SECTION 50005: OFFICE OF FINANCIAL RESEARCH (OFR) FUNDING
Section 50005 caps assessments collected by the OFR, limiting
them to the average actual budgetary expenses of the Financial
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) over the preceding three fiscal
years. This cap would include reimbursements made to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under Section 210(n)(10) of
Dodd-Frank. Any excess funds in the Financial Research Fund
above this three-year average would be required to be transferred
to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. The OFR would also be
prohibited from collecting assessments that would cause the Fund
to exceed this cap.
Background
Title I of Dodd-Frank established the OFR and FSOC to identify
and respond to risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system.
The OFR’s core mission is to support FSOC and promote financial
stability by improving the quality, transparency, and availability of
financial data and by conducting independent research and anal-
ysis of risks to the financial system. Since fiscal year 2012, the
OFR relied on assessments levied on large financial institutions—
specifically, bank holding companies with over $250 billion in as-
sets and non-bank financial firms designated as Systemically Im-
portant Financial Institutions by FSOC—rather than Congres-
sional appropriations. These assessments are deposited in the Fi-
nancial Research Fund.12

Section 50001. HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program
(GRRP)
This section eliminates the remaining funds for HUD’s Green
and Resilient Retrofit Program, funds that were appropriated
through the Inflation Reduction Act, and that have been used to
help finance 37,000 housing units today.
The U.S. is experiencing one of the worst housing and homeless-
ness crises in its history. There is a growing shortage of millions
of homes for rent and purchase.2 Since 2019 alone, median asking
rents have increased by nearly 50% as house prices have reached
an all-time high, surging by nearly 60% during that same time-
frame.3 The ongoing affordable housing crisis has contributed to
more than 771,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given
night,4 the highest rate of renters and homeowners paying over
30% and 50% of their incomes on housing costs,5 over 4.2 million
individuals at risk of eviction or foreclosure,6 and millions of mort-
gage-ready individuals being locked out of the dream of homeown-
ership.7 Moreover, the climate crisis is compounding the housing
supply and affordability challenges as devastating storms and fires
are destroying entire communities and leaving residents displaced
or homeless.8
Section 50001 of H. Con. Res. 14 undermines efforts to address
the climate and housing crises by rescinding unobligated funds
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD)
Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). GRRP funds energy
efficient and climate resilient upgrades in multifamily housing as-
sisted through HUD’s Section 8, 202, and 811 Programs.9 Congress
authorized $1 billion in mandatory funding through the Inflation
Reduction Act under President Biden, including to support up to $4
billion in HUD lending authority. However, upon taking office, the
Trump Administration cancelled GRRP contracts by Executive
Order.10 On April 15, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Rhode Island granted a preliminary injunction in
Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, et al. v. USDA, et al.,
requiring HUD to immediately reinstate GRRP contracts while liti-
gation is pending.11 As of November 2024, HUD reported that it

Sec. 50002. Elimination of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB)
This section eliminates the Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board (PCAOB), an agency that oversees the auditors of U.S.
registered public companies, and transfers the responsibilities to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, without providing any
new funding or preserving the authority to assess fees on the regu-
lated auditors as Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) cur-
rently provides. Congress established the PCAOB in response to
the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. Enron’s collapse
alone resulted in the loss of approximately 25,000 jobs, wiped out
$74 billion in shareholder value, and erased over $2 billion in em-
ployee retirement savings.13 The failure of WorldCom cost share-
holders upwards of $180 billion.14 At the time of failure, Enron was
the 7th largest U.S. public company; for comparison, today Berk-
shire Hathaway and Tesla are the 7th and 8th largest U.S. public
companies. These events, coupled with the subsequent collapse of
Arthur Andersen—then one of the world’s largest accounting
firms—damaged faith in the integrity of U.S. financial reporting
and the auditing profession’s ability to self-regulate. Some analysts
have estimated this period’s broader scandals resulted in approxi-
mately $7 trillion in lost wealth.15
In response to this crisis, Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley—the
centerpiece of which was the creation of PCAOB, whose primary
purpose is to oversee the audits of public companies and to ensure
the accuracy and independence of audit reports. The House—under
the Financial Services Committee’s Republican Chair Mike Oxley—
passed Sarbanes-Oxley with a vote of 423–3, and the bill subse-
quently passed the Senate by a vote of 99–0. President George W.
Bush described it as ‘‘the most far-reaching reform of American
business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt,’’ adding,
‘‘the era of low standards and false profits is over. No boardroom
in America is above or beyond the law.’’ He also focused on the im-
portance of timely and reliable financial information that investors
deserve, saying, ‘‘the only fair risks are based on honest informa-
tion. Tricking an investor into taking a risk is theft by another
name.’’ Finally, he highlighted the critical need for an independent
regulator for the auditing profession: ‘‘the accounting profession
will be regulated by an independent board. This board will set clear
standards to uphold the integrity of public audits and have the au-
thority to investigate abuses and discipline offenders. And auditing
firms will no longer be permitted to provide consulting services

that create conflicts of interest.’’16 In response to the 2008 Finan-
cial Crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Pro-
tection Act of 2010 subsequently expanded the PCAOB’s jurisdic-
tion to oversee auditors of SEC-registered broker-dealers.17
Congress established the PCAOB as an independent, non-profit
body, overseen by the SEC, but crucially, made the PCAOB distinct
from it. This independence was deemed essential to provide fo-
cused, specialized, and unbiased oversight of the audits of public
companies and broker-dealers, and ended the century-long ‘‘vol-
untary self-regulation of the auditing profession and the beginning
of formal, compulsory oversight.’’18
The PCAOB’s mission, mandated by Congress, is explicit: ‘‘to reg-
ulate the audits of public companies and SEC-registered brokers
and dealers in order to protect investors and further the public in-
terest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent
audit reports.’’19 It fulfills this mission through four primary func-
tions:20
1. Registration: Overseeing and maintaining the registration
of all domestic and foreign public accounting firms that audit
U.S. public companies or SEC-registered broker-dealers. Over
1,519, including more than 844 international firms in 80 coun-
tries, are currently registered.
2. Inspection: Conducting regular inspections of registered
firms to assess compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank
Act, PCAOB and SEC rules, and professional auditing stand-
ards. Nine of the largest audit firms, representing 98% of the
total U.S. market capitalization, are audited annually. These
inspections are risk-based, focusing on areas where potential
audit failures pose the greatest threat to investors. Last year,
the PCAOB conducted inspections at 230 audit firms, including
200 inspections in over 31 countries.
3. Standard-Setting: Establishing and maintaining high-
quality auditing, quality control, ethical, and independence
standards for registered firms to follow. These standards serve
as the benchmark for audit quality in the U.S. markets.
4. Enforcement: Investigating potential violations and im-
posing disciplinary sanctions, including monetary penalties,
and barring firms or individuals from auditing public
companieswhen standards are not met.
Through these integrated functions, the PCAOB plays an indis-
pensable role in promoting the reliability of the financial state-
ments upon which investors depend. This PCAOB’s oversight has
contributed to the long-term decline in the frequency of financial

restatements from their peak in the mid-2000s, suggesting an over-
all improvement in financial reporting reliability.21 The PCAOB’s
focused efforts on setting and enforcing what are widely regarded
as gold-standard auditing rules are fundamental to maintaining in-
vestor confidence in U.S. capital markets.22
Effective audit oversight requires deep, specialized expertise. The
PCAOB employs a staff of approximately 800 professionals, many
with highly specialized qualifications and experience in complex
audit methodologies, quality control systems, and forensic account-
ing techniques necessary to effectively ‘‘audit the auditors.’’ This
dedicated workforce represents a significant concentration of exper-
tise focused solely on audit quality. The SEC has a much broader
mandate, encompassing market regulation, enforcement across var-
ious sectors, corporate finance disclosure, investment management
oversight, and more. Its staff expertise is necessarily diverse to
cover these wide-ranging responsibilities.
The PCAOB is funded independently through mandatory ac-
counting support fees levied on the public companies and SEC-reg-
istered broker-dealers it oversees. These fees are set annually
based on the PCAOB’s budget, which is approved by the SEC. The
PCAOB draws no funds from the United States Treasury, and by
statute its receipts are not ‘‘public monies of the United States.’’23
Effect of Eliminating the PCAOB and Transferring Respon-
sibilities to SEC
No Transition Period. Transferring the PCAOB’s highly special-
ized function into the larger, multi-mission SEC structure raises
concerns about dilution of focus and expertise. Audit oversight
could become just one of many competing priorities within the
SEC, potentially losing the singular attention and resource alloca-
tion it currently receives. Furthermore, replicating the PCAOB’s
specialized workforce within the SEC would be a formidable chal-
lenge. It could take years, potentially decades, to recruit, train, and
integrate a comparable cadre of audit oversight specialists within
the SEC’s structure, assuming the necessary resources were even
allocated. During such a transition, the effectiveness of audit over-
sight could diminish, increasing risks for investors.
No Authorization for SEC Funding. Moreover, nothing in the sec-
tion requires Congress to increase the budget of the SEC. Notably,
because the PCAOB offsets its budget with fees paid by regulated
auditors, the SEC would instead have to offset its budget with fees
on securities transactions, which are paid by registered brokers.
Jeopardizing International Oversight. A component of the
PCAOB’s function is its international reach. Sarbanes-Oxley explic-
itly grants the PCAOB authority to oversee, inspect, and inves-
tigate non-U.S. audit firms that participate in the audits of compa-
nies listed on U.S. exchanges or SEC-registered broker-dealers.

This authority is vital as investors in U.S. markets rely on audits
conducted across the globe. The PCAOB currently has authority to
conduct inspections in over 80 foreign jurisdictions, and since 2004,
has inspected auditors in over 58 non-U.S. jurisdictions. This is fa-
cilitated through extensive cross-border cooperation, often formal-
ized in Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or Statements of
Protocol (SOPs) with foreign counterpart audit regulators. A recent
significant achievement was the agreement the current PCAOB
Chair Erica Williams reached with the People’s Republic of China
(PRC).24 Subsequent inspections revealed alarmingly high rates of
deficiencies in the initial audits reviewed.25
Shutting down the PCAOB would place the SOPs at significant
risk. The China SOP, like other international cooperative agree-
ments, specifically names the PCAOB as the U.S. regulatory
body.26 Dissolving the PCAOB as a distinct entity and transferring
its functions to a SEC division would risk introducing serious un-
certainty over the legal standing of these agreements. Renegoti-
ation may be required not only with China but potentially with
regulators in all 81 jurisdictions where the PCAOB currently has
agreements to operate.
Committee staff requested technical analysis from PCAOB and
the SEC regarding the effects of the bill. In Appendix A, below, we
produce their responses, in relevant parts.
Sec. 50003. Significantly Reduced Funding for Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB)
This section would slash the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau’s budget by 70%, undermining the CFPB’s ability to protect
consumers. CFPB obtains its funding from the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (Fed), and the amount the CFPB
can obtain every year is capped at 12% of the Fed’s operating ex-
penses from 2009.27 This cap has been adjusted for inflation since
the CFPB’s creation, and for the current fiscal year 2025 (FY25),
the CFPB’s funding cap is estimated to be $823.1 million.28 This
section, however, dispenses with the past inflation adjustments,
and would reduce the CFPB’s funding cap to $249 million for FY25.
This represents a significant 70% cut to their budget. Going for-
ward, the cap’s inflation adjustment would start again in FY26.
Furthermore, this section caps CFPB’s unobligated balances to 5%
of the annual funding cap ($12.45 million for FY25), and anything
in excess would be remitted to Treasury’s general fund. This sec-
tion also cuts a provision that stipulates that funds CFPB receives
from the Fed are not subject to review by the Appropriations Com-
mittees in the House and Senate, so presumably this may mean

they could hold hearings on CFPB’s funding. However, this section
does not authorize appropriations for CFPB.
In response to the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, caused in
part by a period of unchecked and rampant predatory lending and
a lax approach to enforcing consumer protections, Congress passed
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(Dodd-Frank) in 2010. Dodd-Frank created the CFPB as an inde-
pendent Federal agency solely focused on protecting consumers
from getting ripped off in the financial marketplace.29 Since 2011,
the CFPB has delivered remediation and relief to consumers, while
imposing fines on companies and individuals that break the law.
The CFPB has provided more than $21 billion in relief to 205 mil-
lion harmed consumers in the form of monetary compensation,
principal reductions, and canceled debts, among other things.30
Furthermore, the CFPB has sent more than 10 million consumer
complaints to financial companies named in those complaints, with
98% of consumers receiving a timely response.31
Congress designed the CFPB to be a strong, accountable con-
sumer watchdog led by a single Director appointed by the Presi-
dent and confirmed by the Senate with an independent funding
mechanism that functions apart from the annual appropriations
process, similar to most other financial regulators. The Supreme
Court, with a 7–2 vote in an opinion written by Justice Clarence
Thomas, upheld the constitutionality of CFPB’s funding mechanism
in the matter of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Commu-
nity Financial Services Association of America.32 Additionally, the
CFPB Director is required to report and testify before the Com-
mittee twice a year to discuss the agency’s budget and activities,
something that other regulators like the OCC and FDIC are not re-
quired to do. Unlike other financial regulators, the CFPB’s
rulemakings are subject to a small business review panel process,
as well as review and potential veto by the Financial Stability
Oversight Council.33
The proposed new funding cap of $249 million will not give the
agency sufficient resources to carry out all of its obligations, includ-
ing responding to millions of consumer complaints, issuing regula-
tions, monitoring thousands of bank and nonbank financial compa-
nies that offer consumer financial products and services, con-
ducting examinations of the largest consumer financial companies,
and enforcing the law. In fact, this funding level is 60% less than
what former Trump appointees who led the CFPB believed was re-
quired as a matter of law to fulfill the agency’s statutory obliga-
tions.
After shortly taking over as CFPB Acting Director, Mick
Mulvaney, who was no friend to the agency, requested $0 from the
Fed because the CFPB had sufficient funds to cover the agency’s

operating expenses for the second quarter of FY 2018.34 In his next
quarterly request letter to the Fed, Acting Director Mulvaney com-
plained about the structure of the CFPB but wrote, ‘‘However, I am
bound to execute the law as written.’’35 He also noted that Section
1017 of Dodd-Frank requires the Fed to transfer to the CFPB a
quarterly sum ‘‘determined by the Director to be reasonably nec-
essary to carry out the authorities of the Bureau under Federal
consumer financial law. . .’’36 After doing so, he requested the Fed
transfer to the CFPB $98.5 million ($126.2 million adjusted for in-
flation) for the third quarter of FY18.37
In fact, there were three occasions when Acting Director
Mulvaney and Director Kathy Kraninger made a quarterly funding
request near or above the proposed new annual funding cap of
$249 million. To fund the CFPB’s operations for the first quarter
of FY19, FY20, and FY20, the CFPB leaders requested $219 mil-
lion, $278.1 million, and $249.9 million, respectively, after adjust-
ing for inflation.38 In total, Acting Director Mulvaney and Director
Kraninger made an average quarterly funding request from the
Fed of about $130.1 million (about $155.3 million inflation-ad-
justed), which translated to an average of about $520.5 million an-
nually (about $621.4 million inflation-adjusted).39 Thus, the new
funding cap of $249 million would provide only 40% of the amount
of funds that Mulvaney and Kraninger decided were reasonably
necessary for the CFPB to carry out their law, despite being vocal
critics of the CFPB’s structure.
Sec. 50004. Crippling the CFPB’s Civil Penalty Fund
This section would severely limit CFPB’s use of the Civil Penalty
Fund (CPF). The section requires all CPF funds to be remitted to
Treasury that are not used to remediate directly harmed consumers
relating to that fine. This essentially undermines the purpose of
the CPF, which previously allowed the CFPB to use penalties paid
by bad actors to compensate harmed consumers when they may
otherwise receive partial or no compensation because the violator
closed or went bankrupt. This section also strikes a provision that
allowed the CFPB to use any funding from CPF not immediately
needed to remediate harmed consumers to support financial lit-
eracy, though it is worth noting CFPB rarely used such CPF funds
for such purpose to preserve funding for situations where CFPB
identified and wanted to remediate consumers were harmed by fi-
nancial firms that had closed or went bankrupt.
Congress created the CPF to hold civil penalties collected by the
CFPB from companies and individuals violating consumer financial

protection laws.40 Typically, when a company violates a consumer
financial protection law, the CFPB will order the company to reme-
diate harmed consumers directly and pay a fine to the Civil Pen-
alty Fund. The CFPB is used primarily to compensate harmed con-
sumers who cannot obtain full compensation from the violator, for
example if they subsequently close or go bankrupt after they com-
mitted the consumer violation. CFPB is currently allowed to use
CPF funds for consumer education and financial literacy programs,
though it rarely has done so, opting to preserve funds to remediate
harmed consumers that would not otherwise receive compensa-
tion.41
There have been numerous instances where the CPF has been
helpful to compensate harmed consumers that would not otherwise
receive relief, including when servicemembers, older consumers,
and students have been harmed.42 For example, in December 2024
and January 2025, the CFPB distributed $1.8 billion in refund
checks using the CPF to more than 4 million consumers harmed by
Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com, which the agency previously
found engaged in bait-and-switch advertising and illegally collected
upfront fees for marketed credit repair services.43 CFPB also dis-
tributed $384 million to 191,000 consumers harmed by Think Fi-
nance and their illegal lending practices.44 This section would pre-
vent the CFPB from helping these and similarly situated harmed
consumers in the future, undermining a key consumer protection
tool.
Sec. 50005. Significantly Reduced Funding for Financial Sta-
bility Oversight Council (FSOC) and Office of Financial
Research (OFR)
This section would significantly reduce funding for FSOC and
OFR by more than 90% and would even permit future funding re-
ductions. FSOC and OFR are both funded by the Financial Re-
search Fund (FRF), which is funded through assessments of the
largest banks and nonbank systemically important financial insti-
tutions (SIFIs) designated by FSOC.45 In 2010, Congress, though
the Dodd-Frank Act, created the Financial Stability Oversight
Council (FSOC) and Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR)
to close regulatory gaps exposed by the 2007–2009 global financial
crisis and to ensure the U.S. financial regulatory framework mon-
itored and mitigated threats to U.S. financial stability. FSOC is
comprised of the Federal financial regulators and the Secretary of

the Treasury, who serves as FSOC’s Chairperson.46 FSOC ‘‘was
tasked with identifying risks to financial stability, promoting mar-
ket discipline by eliminating expectations that the government will
prevent firms from failing, and responding to emerging threats to
financial stability.’’47 OFR is an office within the Department of
the Treasury that supports the work of FSOC and its member
agencies, typically through research relating to financial stability.48
This section would effectively limit the FRF to the annual aver-
age of FSOC’s expenses from the three most recent fiscal years that
have been completed, and any excess funds would be remitted to
Treasury’s general fund. Notably, this formula does not include
OFR’s expenses too, which is much larger than FSOC’s. For FY25,
FSOC’s budget is $19.7 million to support 48 employees, while
OFR’s budget is $124.6 million with 231 employees. Combined,
their FY25 budget is $144.3 million. Reviewing FSOC’s expenses
for FY22–FY24,49 this section appears to create an estimated cap
of $13.289 million, representing a 90.8% funding reduction for
FSOC and OFR combined. Furthermore, this section would not pre-
vent FSOC from spending less than their new funding cap, and if
they do, they effectively will be lowering the cap for FSOC and
OFR in future years since the cap itself is based on FSOC’s ex-
penses over a three-year period.
Moreover, this significant funding cut for FSOC and OFR would
also likely curtail the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s
(FDIC) implementation of Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA)
pursuant to Title II of Dodd-Frank. Congress created OLA after
Lehman Brother’s disorderly bankruptcy contributed to the global
financial crisis. OLA gives regulators an alternative to bankruptcy
to safely resolve a large and complex failing financial firm. FSOC
is required to use part of their funds to reimburse FDIC’s reason-
able expenses to implement OLA. Between 2010 and 2022, FSOC
provided $64 million to FDIC for this purpose.50 In 2018, Trump
directed the Treasury Department to study OLA, and the Depart-
ment affirmed, ‘‘Since the bankruptcy of a large, complex financial
company may not be feasible in some circumstances, Treasury also
recommends retaining OLA as an emergency tool for use under ex-
traordinary circumstances.’’51 In September 2023, FDIC’s Office of
Inspector General (OIG) found that FDIC had made progress in im-
plementing the OLA framework, however the OIG made 17 rec-
ommendations of additional steps needed to improve the agency’s
preparedness to utilize OLA to promote financial stability.52 Those
efforts could be curtailed by this section, given the significantly less

funding FSOC would have at its disposal to reimburse the FDIC
with.
It Is worth noting this Is not the first time Republicans have at-
tempted to rollback FSOC and OFR. During Trump’s first term, the
budget and staffing levels for FSOC and OFR were significantly re-
duced. One analysis noted FSOC’s budget was reduced by more
than 25% and staffing was reduced by almost 60%, and OFR’s
staffing levels were cut by more than half.53 The Biden Administra-
tion reversed course to strengthen these financial stability bodies.
For FY25, FSOC planned to increase staffing to 48 full-time equiv-
alent staff (FTEs) compared to 14 FTEs in FY21. OFR planned to
increase its staffing to 231 FTEs, which compares to when OFR
had 111 FTEs in FY21.54 However, this section would impose much
more significant budget cuts on FSOC and OFR than the Trump
Administration advanced in his first term, potentially crippling the
work of these offices to promote financial stability.

the bill, however Committee Republicans unanimously rejected
each of these.55 They include:

APPENDIX A
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS FROM PCAOB
PCAOB programs would be impossible to replicate in the
legislation’s one year timeframe without significant dis-
ruption to audit oversight
The PCAOB has spent the last 22 years developing inspection,
enforcement, and standard-setting programs that are based on
audit-specific experience and expertise. That experience and exper-
tise cannot simply be transferred to the SEC, meaning that there
would be significant disruptions in our programs, putting our in-
vestor-protection mandate at serious risk.
The PCAOB operates three main programs.
• First, we inspect over 200 audit firms each year on a
statutorily mandated schedule. We inspect selected audits and
the quality control systems at these firms and publish our re-
sults in inspection reports. We also provide a remediation proc-
ess that allows firms to correct quality control criticisms that
we find during these inspections.
• Second, we conduct investigations and bring enforcement
matters where we find serious violations of audit-related rules
and standards.
• Finally, we set rules and standards for audits of publicly-
traded companies and broker-dealers. Re-creating these pro-
grams at the SEC would be extremely difficult for two primary
reasons:
First, the PCAOB has spent the last 22 years building our pro-
grams. While our policies and processes are certainly critical to our
programs, it is our people who execute our investor-protection mis-
sion. We have spent more than two decades hiring experts in the
field of auditing and further developing their expertise to perform
inspections, investigations, and enforcement, and standard setting.
It would be very difficult to re-create the talented expert staff that
the PCAOB has assembled. Because each of our programs requires
expertise to execute, including making complex judgments in tech-
nical areas, having the right staff is critical to our success as an
audit regulator.
Second, we have spent twenty years negotiating agreements with
the governments of foreign countries in which we need to perform
inspections and investigations. Many of the countries in which we
perform our work require by law that these agreements be in place.
They are often difficult to negotiate, require the consent of multiple
government bodies, and have taken years to put in place. The SEC
is not a party to these agreements, and the agreements do not pro-
vide for assigning the duties and privileges of these agreements to
another party, like the

SEC. As a result, the SEC will not be able to inspect or inves-
tigate in many of these countries, including China, until new agree-
ments are reached.
As discussed in greater detail below, we estimate that it will take
years to reassemble staff with the experience and expertise nec-
essary to perform these inspections and to negotiate agreements
with foreign governments required to perform our work. While
those processes are ongoing, audit firms will know that their regu-
lator is compromised and unable to adequately inspect and inves-
tigate their work. That puts investors in a dangerous position.
Experience of PCAOB staff
The PCAOB performs a large number of inspections each year.
We have approximately 480 inspectors who conduct inspections, in-
cluding selecting engagements for inspection, drafting inspection
reports, and conducting our quality control remediation process,
and many others are essential to supporting their work. In 2024,
our inspectors spent over 750,000 hours inspecting 231 audit firms,
including reviewing portions of over 900 individual audits, and con-
ducting our quality control remediation process. These inspections
were performed in 36 countries and include more than 20,000
hours that the PCAOB spent inspecting firms in mainland China
and Hong Kong. In order to maintain that level of inspections
work, the SEC would need to assemble a comparably-sized team of
highly experienced staff willing and able to travel around the world
to perform this work. We additionally have over 70 staff across our
Office of the Chief Auditor and Office of Economic and Risk Anal-
ysis who all have unique experience to consult with and assist in-
spectors. These are aside from staff who have gained specialized
experience operationalizing our programs. our programs.
The experience and expertise of the team are just as important
as its size. Our inspections staff average 22 years of auditing and
inspections experience. On average, half of that experience (11
years) was obtained working at public accounting firms and half
was obtained working at the PCAOB. Our inspection leaders aver-
age over 31 years of experience, of which nearly half (14 years) oc-
curred in public accounting prior to joining the PCAOB.
Our inspections staff have professional expertise in over 30 dif-
ferent industry sectors, including banking, technology, manufac-
turing, retail, oil and gas, and broker-dealers. Many of these sec-
tors require specialized accounting, making this expertise invalu-
able. Our inspections staff also have expertise across 40 different
subject matters that involve complex accounting and auditing, in-
cluding revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, derivatives,
business combinations, and technology. Additionally, our inspection
staff have expertise in over 30 different languages, which is impor-
tant to support our work across the globe.
The same is true across our enforcement and standard-setting
groups. Our staff are experts in auditing and are therefore able to
bring complex auditing-related investigations and enforcement
matters and draft standards that address the audit issues that put
investors at risk. On average, our enforcement staff have over eight
years of professional experience at the PCAOB, and most have a
minimum of seven years of experience addressing complex legal

726
and accounting/auditing issues before coming to the PCAOB. Our
standard-setting staff have an average of nearly 10 years of stand-
ard-setting and rulemaking experience at the PCAOB, in addition
to a minimum of 10 years of experience working in public account-
ing before joining the PCAOB.
Because of the experience and expertise required to successfully
execute our programs, it has taken many years to build them to
their current levels. Our inspection program began in 2003, and it
took approximately six years for the inspection program to develop
to the point where all statutorily required inspections of U.S. firms
were performed at a basic level. More advanced types of inspections
and inspections of certain critical foreign firms came later.
Inspectors’ familiarity with the firms and their methodologies
has continuously increased and contributes to the effectiveness and
efficiency of inspections.
Still, even if the SEC assumed the significant cost of offering po-
sitions to all 480 plus PCAOB staff needed to conduct inspections,
it is not guaranteed staff would be available to fill those roles.
There is currently an industry-wide shortage of accounting and
audit talent, and our team members are some of the most respected
and employable members of the profession. In the last few years,
firms have hired many of our staff members, often at significant
salary increases. Our team members would be highly valued both
in companies’ accounting departments and at audit firms.
The SEC would be unable to inspect and investigate in the
most critical foreign jurisdictions for a significant pe-
riod of time, if at all
As a threshold matter, without greatly expanding on it in this
letter, there is a risk that the Proposed Bill would be deemed to
have no extraterritorial application—meaning the Proposed Bill
might eliminate inspections and investigations abroad. In such
case, the Proposed Bill will all but nullify the Holding Foreign
Companies Accountable Act, signed into law by President Donald
J. Trump, which gave the PCAOB historic access to Chinese audit
firms.
Potential legal deficiencies aside, the PCAOB regulates audit
firms that audit publicly-traded companies listed on U.S. stock ex-
changes (among other issuers), regardless of where those compa-
nies or their auditors are located. This means that there are many
foreign audit firms that fall within the PCAOB’s jurisdiction. In
fact, of the 1,519 audit firms registered with the PCAOB as of April
15, 2025, 844 of them were non-U.S. firms.
The fact that a majority of registered firms are non-U.S. firms
creates unique challenges. Many jurisdictions—including China,
Hong Kong, and every member state of the European Economic
Area—require that we enter into agreements with their govern-
ments in order to inspect and investigate audit firms in their coun-
tries. These agreements include statements of protocol with provi-
sions on how inspections will be conducted, how foreign govern-
ments will facilitate (but not interfere with) our inspections, and
how confidential information will be shared between the PCAOB
and the foreign audit regulator, and they were negotiated over a
period of twenty years. More than a dozen of the agreements are

727
accompanied by separate, detailed data protection agreements that
govern our procedures for handling protected information, such as
personally-identifiable information, obtained in foreign jurisdic-
tions.
The PCAOB currently has 27 working arrangements (not includ-
ing accompanying data protection agreements) with foreign au-
thorities, including a statement of protocol signed in 2022 that al-
lows us to inspect and investigate completely in mainland China
and Hong Kong for the first time. These agreements facilitate co-
operation in each of these jurisdictions, but they are currently re-
quired in 20 jurisdictions for us to perform our work, including
mainland China, Hong Kong, countries in the European Union and
European Economic Area (EU/EEA), Switzerland, and the United
Kingdom (with more EU/EEA countries requiring inspections—and
therefore agreements—in the next few years). These are some of
the jurisdictions with the most registered firms and some of the
largest public companies. Together, firms in these 20 jurisdictions
audit public companies representing $6.3 trillion in global market
capitalization—roughly half of the $12.3 trillion market capitaliza-
tion of public companies audited by all non-U.S. firms inspected by
the PCAOB.
None of the agreements contains provisions that would allow the
PCAOB’s privileges and responsibilities under the agreements to be
transferred to the SEC. In fact, all of the agreements are vol-
untary, and either party can exit the agreement at any time. This
means that the foreign jurisdictions can simply end the agree-
ments, are not in any way required to form new agreements with
the SEC, and may indeed be required by their own laws to renego-
tiate such agreements.
These agreements give the PCAOB access that the SEC does not
otherwise have. Importantly, the PCAOB’s newly-obtained ability
to inspect and investigate Chinese firms, made possible by the
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, would not transfer to
the SEC and would be lost unless a new agreement can be formed
and successfully implemented. PCAOB inspections and enforce-
ment matters have revealed poor audit quality at several Chinese
firms and have allowed us to take steps to protect investors who
invest in Chinese companies traded on U.S. exchanges. That ability
to protect investors in Chinese companies would, at a minimum, be
significantly disrupted.
Even if the SEC were able to negotiate new agreements, it would
take a significant amount of time. Many of these agreements have
taken years to negotiate (and, collectively, well over a decade), and
they often require the approvals of several government entities
within a given jurisdiction. A transfer of PCAOB inspections func-
tions to the SEC can be expected to delay, at least, the 2025 and
2026 inspections of non-U.S. firms as authorities in those jurisdic-
tions assess whether they can facilitate SEC access to audit work
papers in compliance with local laws under existing arrangements
or whether new agreements and/or regulatory approvals are re-
quired.
For example, the law in the European Union requires an ‘‘Ade-
quacy Decision’’ for foreign regulators, like the PCAOB or SEC, be-
fore any audit firm may transfer audit work papers to that audit

728
regulator for inspections or investigations. Although the current
EU Adequacy Decision recognizes the SEC as a ‘‘competent author-
ity’’ to investigate audit firms in the EU, the PCAOB is the only
U.S. authority to whom firms in the EU can transfer audit work
papers and associated material for inspections.
The SEC would therefore need European authorities to revise the
current Adequacy Decision to include the SEC as a party to whom
audit work papers may be transferred for the purpose of inspec-
tions, and that statutory legal process alone requires nine months
to a year. The European Commission (EC) initiates and manages
this process, but it requires fact finding and legal analysis by, con-
sultation with, and an affirmative vote of, all European Economic
Area (EEA) audit regulators (via the Committee of European Audit
Oversight Bodies or CEAOB). The PCAOB was able to obtain an
Adequacy Decision only after an extensive education campaign
about its inspection and enforcement processes and legal protec-
tions under U.S. law for information provided to the PCAOB by EU
auditors, as well as reaching a nuanced understanding with regard
to the reliance among audit regulators that is required by EU law.
Additionally, EU law and the Adequacy Decision require that
each EEA audit regulator have in place bilateral agreements with
third-country audit regulators, such as the PCAOB or SEC, that
satisfy EU law, before firms can provide audit work papers to the
third-country authorities. These arrangements address legal re-
quirements on both sides, including the scope of cooperation, the
confidentiality of information provided, the scope of the use of such
information, potential onward transfer of information to other au-
thorities, and the protection and use of personal data. Finally, be-
cause the U.S. is not deemed adequate by the EU with respect to
the protection of personal data, an administrative arrangement (bi-
lateral agreement) addressing the requirements of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the transfer of personal
data to an audit regulator in the U.S. is also required. Such agree-
ments must be approved by a European Data Protection Board
(EDPB) opinion finding that the agreements are compliant with
GDPR (as required by EU law, including the Adequacy Decision).
The PCAOB’s negotiation and EDPB approval of a model data pro-
tection agreement took well over two years, and the PCAOB con-
tinues to negotiate additional agreements based on this model,
which takes months, if not longer, given the country-specific ap-
proval processes required in each EU member state.
These are just examples for European Union countries. Other
countries present different challenges, and legal conflicts must be
resolved frequently.
The PCAOB is uniquely positioned to secure and maintain these
critical bilateral agreements. In particular, the PCAOB staff be-
lieve that the PCAOB’s status as a non-governmental entity and
the restrictions in SOX related to the PCAOB’s use and onward
transfer of information received in connection with PCAOB inspec-
tions and investigations were extremely helpful in achieving access
to jurisdictions around the world. While challenges reaching new
agreements with other countries are likely not insurmountable,
they will take time and skill to surmount.

We do not anticipate the proposal having the desired cost
savings for the federal government
It is not at all clear that transferring the PCAOB’s responsibil-
ities to the SEC would result in any cost savings for the federal
government. First, it should be noted that because the PCAOB is
a private entity, the majority of whose funding comes from fees
paid by the largest publicly-traded companies, rather than through
taxes, transferring the PCAOB’s responsibilities to the SEC would
require an expansion of the federal budget.
As described above, in order to execute the PCAOB’s responsibil-
ities, the SEC would need to hire hundreds of highly-skilled staff
members. Although publicly-available information on SEC salary
ranges also indicates that the average salaries of our inspectors are
comparable to salaries of professionals at the SEC, over the last
three years our staff seldom moved from the PCAOB to the SEC.
The SEC also would need to set up and maintain systems that
would allow them to perform inspections, including IT systems to
document inspections work and retain firm work papers that serve
as evidence of the inspection findings. Such systems are expected
to cost tens of millions of dollars to develop and maintain.
Consequently, there likely would be minimal to no savings in
compensation and IT costs related to our inspections program
should it transfer to the SEC. While we have not been contacted
by the Congressional Budget Office seeking our technical assist-
ance, we stand ready to offer our perspective on the budgetary im-
plications of the Proposed Bill.
The potential legal ramifications of the Proposed Bill’s cut-
and-paste approach
As an initial matter, the ‘‘cut and paste’’ approach the Proposed
Bill takes to simply replace all references to the PCAOB under cur-
rent law with the SEC may result in significant unintended con-
sequences. For instance, the Proposed Bill requires that any ref-
erence to the Board in any law, regulation, document, record, map,
or other paper of the United States be treated as a reference to the
‘‘Commission.’’ In so doing, where Section 101(b) of SOX previously
referenced the PCAOB, it would now read, ‘‘the Commission shall
not be an agency or establishment of the United States Govern-
ment. . . . No member or person employed by, or agent for, the
Commission shall be deemed to be an officer or employee of or
agent for the Federal Government by reason of such service.’’
This is just one example; there are more. The Proposed Bill
leaves the PCAOB in a state of existential purgatory; transfers in-
tellectual property retained by the PCAOB, including that which
was developed by or in conjunction with third parties, to the SEC
without consideration of the constitutional or contractual implica-
tions of doing so; makes consequential changes to the current
multi-level review framework for registration disapproval decisions,
inspection findings, and remediation determinations; and elevates
the PCAOB’s existing processes to the functional equivalent of SEC
rules. These are some of the many complex issues that our staff
have identified since we first learned of the language of the Pro-
posed Bill near midnight last Friday.

The legal complexities and the potential market implications of
disrupting domestic and foreign inspections (among other con-
sequences) require careful deliberation. PCAOB staff have had
mere days to consider these significant changes. By comparison,
prior to enacting SOX, the Senate Banking Committee held ten
hearings and engaged in a four-months-long bipartisan delibera-
tion. The House Financial Services Committee held three hearings
and deliberated for five weeks. The legal, practical, and market im-
pacts of significant changes to the PCAOB are of such magnitude
that significant difficulties may arise if those changes are made
without sufficient time and deliberation, potentially resulting in
harm to investors. The PCAOB staff will continue to assess the im-
pacts of the Proposed Bill and stand ready to provide technical as-
sistance.
The Proposed Bill would lead to significant gaps in investor
protection
In summary, this proposal would lead to significant gaps in in-
vestor protection. The SEC already has a wide mandate. Adding to
it would take significant time and resources. Adding a global audit
oversight function would stretch the SEC’s resources thin, disrupt
ongoing inspections of audit firms, and nullify carefully negotiated
agreements. By contrast, the PCAOB has focused exclusively on
audit quality and resulting investor protection for over 20 years
and has built a successful program that is a model for audit regu-
lators around the world. Much of the PCAOB’s expertise and expe-
rience would be sacrificed by transferring its functions to the SEC,
and we expect that there would be significant disruptions in audit
oversight over the coming years while the SEC tries to build that
experience and expertise in-house and attempts to secure agree-
ments with foreign governments.
When similar audit oversight was absent in the early 2000s, ac-
counting restatements and fraud wiped out hundreds of billions of
dollars in shareholder value. History shows us what happens when
auditor scrutiny faces impediments. These disruptions invite that
risk back into today’s far larger and far more interconnected mar-
kets.
Technical Analysis from the SEC regarding the PCAOB section
(Section 50002) of the bill produced at the request of the Com-
mittee staff, reproduced here, in relevant parts.
Does the SEC have any indication or engagement to suggest
that jurisdiction that have signed SOPs with PCAOB are
willing to sign similar SOPs with the SEC?
OCA Response: OCA understands that the SEC is not a party to
any of the PCAOB’s SOPs. For more than three decades, the SEC
has developed an extensive list of Memorandums of Understanding
with many foreign authorities under § 24 of the Exchange Act. Ad-
ditional analysis is required to determine their breadth, including
applicability to audit oversight and regulation. We feel confident
that the SEC could accede to these relationships.

How many examiners or auditors does the SEC employ who
have specialized experience in inspecting audit firms?
OCA Response: As of April 2025, OCA does not employ any per-
sonnel with experience conducting examinations or inspections of
registered public accounting firms. Certain OCA staff in the Profes-
sional Practice Group, Accounting Group, and International Group
have previous private sector experience conducting internal inspec-
tions of audits. As part of the Commission’s current PCAOB over-
sight responsibilities, there are nine professionals in OCA’s profes-
sional practice group, in addition to the Acting Chief Accountant,
who regularly engage on issues related to the PCAOB’s inspection
program (e.g., methodology, reporting, interim Commission review
of PCAOB inspection reports pursuant to 17 CFR § 202.140). There
are an additional two personnel in the International Group who
regularly engage on international auditing and oversight activities
that consider audit firm inspection issues. Additionally, the draft
legislation provides that employees of the Board ‘‘may be offered
equivalent positions on Commission staff.’’
How many auditors does the SEC have that have previously in-
spected audit firms under SOX?
OCA Response: OCA is not aware of any of its personnel that
have engaged in the examination of an audit firm pursuant to SOX
(presumably as a member of the PCAOB staff). Note—this does not
include SEC personnel’s engagement on Interim Commission re-
view of PCAOB inspection reports pursuant to 17 CFR § 202.140
as responsive. Additionally, the draft legislation provides that em-
ployees of the Board ‘‘may be offered equivalent positions on Com-
mission staff.’’
How many individuals in SEC’s Office of Chief Accountant
are professional accounting fellows?
OCA Response: As of April 2025, 10 of OCA’s 40 employees are
Professional Accounting Fellows.
For each of the last 5 years, what has been the average salary

ing fellows?

How many of these professional accounting fellows have re-
turned to accounting firms/audit firms?
OCA Response: OCA does not maintain official records of former
employees’ current employer. However, based on historical experi-
ence, a majority of OCA’s Professional Accounting Fellows seek em-
ployment at accounting firms at the end of their fellowship. OCA
also notes that OCA Professional Accounting Fellows have not sole-
ly been hired from accounting firms (e.g., fellows have been accept-
ed into the program from public companies and standard-setting
bodies).
How many of the former professional accounting fellows
have appeared or practiced or engaged before OCA?
OCA Response: OCA does not maintain records of former employ-
ees’ appearance and practice before the Commission or engagement
with OCA. However, based on historical experience, a majority of
OCA’s Professional Accounting Fellows appear and practice before
the Commission in some capacity (e.g., as an auditor or preparer
of financial statements) following employment in accordance with
the SEC post-employment restrictions.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee ad-
vises that the findings and recommendations of the Committee,
based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X, are in-
corporated in the descriptive portions of this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE, NEW BUDGET
AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX EXPENDITURES
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII
and section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and
with respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII and
section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Com-
mittee adopts as its own the estimate of any new budget authority,
spending authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in
revenues or tax expenditures contained in the cost estimate pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation would directly appropriate funds for
• Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to construct, up-
grade, and replace barriers on U.S. borders; procure new vehi-
cles and technology; and perform other activities related to bor-
der security
• CBP to hire additional border patrol agents and other per-
sonnel, provide signing and retention bonuses, and expand
marketing and recruitment to increase the CBP workforce
• The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to
protect the private residences of the President
• FEMA to reimburse state and local governments for costs
incurred in hosting the 2028 Olympic Games and 2026 FIFA
World Cup, to procure technology for state and local govern-

ments to counter unmanned aircraft systems, and to make
grants under the Operation Stonegarden Program
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from
• Expending funds directly appropriated for CBP’s and
FEMA’s activities
Areas of significant uncertainty include
• Projecting CBP’s pace of spending and the amount spent
by 2034 on construction of physical barrier systems
• Projecting how quickly CBP could hire additional border
patrol agents and officers
Legislation summary: H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution
on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, instructed the House Com-
mittee on Homeland Security to recommend legislative changes
that would increase deficits up to a specified amount over the
2025–2034 period. As part of the reconciliation process, the House
Committee on Homeland Security approved legislation on April 29,
2025, that would increase deficits.
Estimated Federal cost: The reconciliation recommendations of
the House Committee on Homeland Security would increase defi-
cits by $67.1 billion over the 2025–2034 period. The estimated
budgetary effects of the legislation are shown in Table 1. The costs
of the legislation fall within budget functions 450 (community and
regional development) and 750 (administration of justice).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legis-
lation will be enacted in summer 2025. CBO’s estimates are rel-
ative to its January 2025 baseline and cover the period from 2025
through 2034. Outlays of appropriated amounts were estimated
using historical obligation and spending rates for similar programs.
Direct spending: Enacting this legislation would increase direct
spending by $67.1 billion over the 2025–2034 period (see Table 2).
All of that amount would result from specified direct appropria-
tions for activities performed by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP)
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Border Barrier System Construction, Invasive Species, and Bor-
der Security Facilities Improvements. Section 60001 would appro-
priate $51.6 billion for border barrier system construction and re-
lated activities, increasing outlays by $49.7 billion over the 2025–
2034 period, CBO estimates.
Border Barrier System and Technology. The legislation would ap-
propriate $46.5 billion for CBP to construct, upgrade, and replace

components of the barrier system along the southwestern, north-
ern, and maritime borders of the United States.
Based on an analysis of information from CBP and historical
rates of spending on border construction projects, CBO estimates
that enacting the provision would increase outlays by $44.6 billion
over the 2025–2034 period.
CBO expects that all of the funds provided by the legislation will
be obligated before the period of availability expires at the end of
2029. However, we do not expect that all funds will be spent during
the 2025–2034 period based on the historical spending patterns for
other federal construction projects and because the pace of spend-
ing for construction projects typically spans more than five years
from the time funds are obligated. (Under the rules that govern the
federal budget, CBP would need to return any unspent funds to the
Treasury on September 30, 2034.)
CBP Facilities and Checkpoints and Invasive Species Eradi-
cation. The legislation also would appropriate $5.0 billion for CBP
to lease, acquire, and construct new facilities and checkpoints, and
to upgrade or replace existing facilities and $50 million to eradicate
invasive plant species along the border, increasing outlays by those
amounts over the 2025–2034 period.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection Personnel and Fleet Vehi-
cles. Section 60002 would appropriate $8.3 billion for CBP to re-
cruit, hire, and train, personnel and to procure new vehicles and
technology, increasing outlays by $8.3 billion over the 2025–2034
period.
CBP Personnel and Training. The legislation would appropriate
the following amounts for CBP personnel and training:
• $4.1 billion for CBP to hire, train, and, in some cases, re-
hire federal employees as border patrol agents, field operations
officers, air and marine agents, and support staff; and
• $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses.
CBP currently employs about 19,000 border patrol agents, 26,000
officers, and 1,400 air and marine operators. The agency indicates
that the funding provided by the legislation would be used to hire
approximately 8,500 employees, including 5,000 officers and 3,000
border patrol agents. Using information from the agency, CBO ex-
pects that officers and agents would be hired gradually over the
next 10 years, with most additions occurring in the next five years,
and that enacting this provision would increase outlays by $6.2 bil-
lion over the 2025–2034 period.
Training, Recruitment, and Screening and Patrol Vehicle Pro-
curement. Additionally, the legislation would appropriate the fol-
lowing amounts, increasing outlays equal to the appropriated
amounts over the 2025–2034 period:
• $750 million for CBP to train staff at Federal Law En-
forcement Training Centers and to improve those facilities;
• $600 million for marketing, recruitment, applicant screen-
ing, and programs to facilitate staff reassignments and reloca-
tion; and
• $813 million for CBP to lease or purchase patrol vehicles.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection Technology, National Vet-
ting Center, and Other Efforts to Enhance Border Security. Section
60003 would appropriate $6.3 billion for CBP to procure, upgrade,

and integrate new technology into the border control system, in-
creasing outlays by $6.3 billion over the 2025–2034 period.
The funding would include:
• $4.5 billion for surveillance towers, linear ground detection
systems, nonintrusive inspection systems, and scanners for the
agency’s biometric entry and exit program;
• $1.2 billion for CBP to acquire or upgrade various air and
marine systems, including aircraft, watercraft, and unmanned
aircraft systems, which CBO expects would be procured in bulk
purchases; and
• $517 million for other CBP activities, including funds to
combat drug trafficking, to support screening of applicants by
the National Vetting Center, and for other activities including
commemorations of events related to border security.
State and Local Law Enforcement Presidential Residence Protec-
tion. Section 60004 would appropriate $300 million for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to reimburse state and
local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred to protect the pri-
vate residences of the President, increasing outlays by $300 million
over the 2025–2034 period. Most of those amounts would cover
overtime pay for officers and other personnel.
State Homeland Security Grant Program. Section 60005 would
appropriate $2.6 billion for FEMA to support state and local law
enforcement agencies addressing security threats, increasing out-
lays by $2.6 billion over the 2025–2034 period.
The funding would include:
• $1 billion to reimburse state and local governments for se-
curity, planning, and other costs related to hosting the 2028
Olympic Games;
• $625 million for similar activities for the 2026 FIFA World
Cup;
• $500 million for FEMA to enhance state and local govern-
ments’ detection and monitoring of threats from unmanned air-
craft systems; and
• $450 million for the Operation Stonegarden Grant Pro-
gram, which covers costs for personnel and equipment incurred
by state and local governments as part of joint operations to
secure U.S. borders.
Uncertainty: Significant uncertainty surrounds CBO’s projections
of the pace at which CBP would obligate funds and the total
amount the agency could spend by 2034 to construct walls, fences,
facilities, and checkpoints for the border barrier system. These
amounts significantly exceed amounts previously provided for simi-
lar activities. For example, over the 2018–2021 period, lawmakers
appropriated about $5.5 billion for physical barriers on the south-
western border of the United States. By the end of 2024, CBP had
spent roughly $2.6 billion—less than half of the amount provided.
How quickly funds provided in this legislation would be spent
will depend on factors that include the availability of contractors;
fluctuations in the cost and availability of materials; and CBP’s
ability to acquire private land or obtain access to state, local, or
tribal property.
Based on information from the agency, CBO expects that some
stages of the process could progress more quickly than they might

have in the past—many aspects of planning, land acquisition, and
permitting for certain segments of the border have been completed
or streamlined. However, the pace of spending on construction
funded by the legislation is uncertain and the total amounts spent
over the 2025–2034 period could be larger or smaller than CBO es-
timates here.
Considerable uncertainty also surrounds projections of the pace
at which CBP would hire new personnel, particularly border patrol
agents and officers. Although the legislation would provide funding
for signing and retention bonuses and increase spending on mar-
keting, recruitment, and screening of new employees, significant
uncertainty exists about how responsive the labor supply might be
to fill those positions. In recent years, because of background
checks, training requirements, and other pre-employment proc-
esses, the time to recruit and hire new officers has ranged from 300
to 600 days. As a result, the pace of spending on personnel over
the 2025–2034 period could be faster or slower than CBO estimates
here.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays that are subject to those pay-as-you-go proce-
dures are shown in Table 1.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting the legislation would not increase net direct
spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-
year periods beginning in 2035.
Mandates: The legislation contains no intergovernmental or pri-
vate-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act.
Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Jeremy Crimm (for Cus-
toms and Border Protection); Jon Sperl (for Customs and Border
Protection, and Federal Emergency Management Agency). Man-
dates: Rachel Austin.
Estimate reviewed by: Justin Humphrey, Chief, Finance, Hous-
ing, and Education Cost Estimates Unit; Kathleen FitzGerald,
Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; Christina Hawley An-
thony, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; H. Samuel Papenfuss,
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; Chad Chirico, Director of
Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of
1995.
DUPLICATIVE FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII, the Committee finds that
Committee Print 119–A: Providing for reconciliation pursuant to H.
Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal
Year 2025 does not contain any provision that establishes or reau-
thorizes a program known to be duplicative of another Federal pro-
gram.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED
TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with rule XXI, this bill, as reported, contains no
congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff bene-
fits as defined in clause 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of rule XXI.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that Committee Print 119–A: Providing for
reconciliation pursuant to H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolu-
tion on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025 does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 60001. Border Barrier System Construction, Invasive Spe-
cies, and Border Security Facilities Improvements
This section appropriates $46,500,000,000 to the Commissioner
of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for construction, in-
stallation, or improvements of primary, waterborne, and secondary
barriers, as well as technology upgrades such as, but not limited
to, lighting, surveillance systems, smart access roads, and fiber
optic cables to support enhanced communication and situational
awareness across the border.
For nearly three decades, the use of physical barriers has been
a core component of CBP’s comprehensive border security strategy.
Since the initial construction of border barriers in the San Diego
Sector in 1991, U.S. Border Patrol agents have consistently advo-
cated for barrier infrastructure, due to its proven effectiveness in
enhancing domain awareness and agent safety.
The Committee believes that physical barriers serve as a critical
force-multiplier by delaying illegal entries and giving frontline

agents valuable time to detect, assess, and respond to migration
events.
This section also appropriates $50,000,000 to CBP for the eradi-
cation and removal of carrizo cane and salt cedar plants. These
invasive, dense, and fast-growing plants pose a significant tactical
challenge for Border Patrol agents along the Rio Grande River as
they can create major blind spots, severely limiting agents’ ability
to detect and respond to illegal crossings. The Committee believes
that by eradication of these invasive species along key sections of
the Rio Grande River will help improve and enhance visibility and
ensure agent safety by restoring line-of-sight capabilities and in-
creasing early detection of illicit activity.
Finally, this section will appropriate $5,000,000,000 for CBP to
lease, acquire, upgrade, and/or expand U.S. Border Patrol, Air and
Marine Operations, and Office of Field Operations facilities. CBP
personnel operate on the front lines every day, yet many are forced
to work out of facilities that are overcrowded, structurally inad-
equate, and technologically outdated. The Committee believes that
investing in CBP’s physical infrastructure is not just about mod-
ernization, it’s about mission effectiveness and safety.
Section 60002. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Personnel and
Fleet Vehicles
This section appropriates $4,100,000,000 to CBP for the hiring
and training additional Border Patrol agents, Office of Field Oper-
ations officers, Air and Marine agents, rehired annuitants, and
CBP support staff. Under the previous administration, agents and
officers faced extreme operational pressure, mental health con-
cerns, and an overwhelming sense of mission fatigue. The Com-
mittee believes that increasing the number of frontline personnel
will help to alleviate the burden on current agents and officers and
help restore morale.
This section also appropriates $2,052,630,000 to CBP for annual
retention bonuses or signing bonuses to eligible Border Patrol
agents, Office of Field Operations officers, and Air and Marine
agents. CBP is currently facing a staffing crisis that threatens the
agency’s ability to meet its core national security mission. As the
demands on frontline personnel continue to grow, CBP is strug-
gling to recruit and retain the skilled workforce necessary to meet
these demands. In some of the most critical geographic areas, per-
sistent staffing shortages have left agents overextended and vul-
nerable to burnout. The Committee believes that the CBP mission
depends on a resilient and dedicated workforce. The Committee
strongly supports investments in annual retention and signing bo-
nuses to secure the personnel needed to protect our borders, uphold
the rule of law, and safeguard our national security for years to
come.
This section also appropriates $813,000,000 for CBP to lease or
acquire additional patrol units. CBP operates one of the largest law
enforcement vehicle fleets in the federal government, with thou-
sands of vehicles deployed across some of the most challenging and
remote terrain in the country. These vehicles are essential tools
serving as mobile command centers, transportation platforms, and
first-response units that enable agents to carry out their mission

of securing the border. Unfortunately, the agency’s current fleet is
rapidly aging. Many vehicles in operation have exceeded their rec-
ommended service life, leading to increased maintenance costs,
higher rates of mechanical failure, and reduced reliability in the
field. This not only jeopardizes agent and officer safety but also
hinders mission readiness and response times during critical oper-
ations.
This section also appropriates, to the Director of the Federal Law
Enforcement Training Center, $285,000,000 to support the training
of newly hired federal law enforcement personnel employed by the
Department of Homeland Security, and $465,000,000 for the pro-
curement, construction, and improvements to Federal Law Enforce-
ment Training Center (FLETC) facilities.
FLETC provides training for federal law enforcement personnel
across four campuses located in New Mexico, Georgia, South Caro-
lina, and Maryland. In addition to serving over 125 federal partner
agencies, FLETC also supports state, local, tribal, and inter-
national law enforcement organizations with specialized training
resources. FLETC plays a vital role in both the initial training and
ongoing professional development of DHS law enforcement per-
sonnel. The Committee believes funding in this section is essential
as CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement seek to
recruit, train, and deploy additional personnel to meet mission de-
mands.
Finally, this section also appropriates $600,000,000 to CBP for
marketing, recruiting, applicant sourcing and vetting, and oper-
ational mobility programs for border security personnel. The in-
crease in law enforcement personnel is only possible with invest-
ments to increase hiring capabilities. This can include every step
from recruitment to medical and fitness assessments, entrance
exams, and training professionals. In addition to these efforts to ex-
pand CBP’s hiring capacity, the funding supports significant re-
cruitment incentives to increase the pool of candidates in the appli-
cation and assessment process.
Section 60003. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Technology,
National Vetting Center, and Other Efforts to Enhance Border
Security
This section appropriates $1,076,317,000 to CBP to procure and
integrate new Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) equipment and asso-
ciated civil works, artificial intelligence, integration, and machine
learning, as well as other mission support, to combat the entry of
illicit narcotics along the southwest, northern, and maritime bor-
ders. At our ports of entry, CBP employs NII technology to detect
and interdict illicit drugs, including fentanyl, as well as concealed
currency, contraband, and individuals being smuggled into the
country. While CBP has made huge strides in interdiction efforts,
its current screening capacity at ports of entry remains alarmingly
limited. The Committee believes that these gaps leave our south-
west, northern, and maritime borders vulnerable to exploitation by
transnational criminal organizations trafficking fentanyl and other
deadly substances into our communities.
This section also appropriates $2,766,000,000 to CBP to upgrade
and procure border surveillance technologies along the southwest,

northern, and maritime borders. As threats to our national security
grow more complex, CBP must have the tools it needs to detect,
monitor, and respond to illicit activity across all sectors of the bor-
der. The Committee believes investing in advanced surveillance
technology along the southwest, northern, and maritime borders is
essential to maintaining domain awareness and ensuring the safety
of our frontline personnel. Technology in this section includes, but
is not limited to, ground detection sensors, integrated surveillance
towers, tunnel detection capability, unmanned aircraft systems
(UAS), and enhanced communications equipment.
This section also appropriates $673,000,000 to CBP for necessary
expenses, including the deployment of technology, relating to the
biometric entry and exit system under section 7208 of the Intel-
ligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (8 U.S.C.
1365b). Investing in the expansion of CBP’s entry/exit system is a
critical step toward strengthening America’s national security, en-
forcing immigration laws, and modernizing the travel experience at
air, land, and seaports of entry. As the volume of international
travel continues to rise and global threats evolve, traditional iden-
tity verification methods are no longer sufficient to meet today’s
operational demands. Unfortunately, full implementation of the
exit system remains incomplete. Biometric entry and exit expan-
sion will not only enhance CBP’s operational effectiveness and effi-
ciency, but it will also provide law enforcement and intelligence
partners with timely and accurate information to help identify
fraud and persons who overstay their visas.
This section also appropriates $1,234,000,000 to CBP for Air and
Marine Operations (AMO) upgrades and procurement of new plat-
forms for rapid air and marine response capabilities. Through the
deployment of advanced aircraft and marine vessels outfitted with
cutting-edge technology, this will enable AMO to expand their
reach allowing for continuous detection, monitoring, and tracking of
potential threats approaching or operating within U.S. borders.
This section appropriates $16,000,000 to CBP for necessary ex-
penses related to U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s National
Vetting Center (NVC) to support screening, vetting activities, and
expansion of the criminal history database of foreign nationals. As
transnational criminal networks grow more sophisticated, the Com-
mittee believes that CBP must be equipped with the tools and data
necessary to identify threats swiftly and accurately. Expanding the
NVC is essential to enhancing national security and protecting
communities by assisting frontline agents and officers to make in-
formed, real-time decisions during border encounters.
This section appropriates $500,000,000 to the Secretary of Home-
land Security (Secretary) for targeted communication campaigns
designed to combat drug trafficking, fentanyl and its precursor
chemicals, and counter adversarial messaging operations. Cartels
increasingly exploit social media platforms such as TikTok and
Snapchat to recruit associates and facilitate trafficking activities.
Given the escalating threats posed by transnational criminal orga-
nizations, targeted communication plans are crucial in deterring
these illicit activities and mitigating the cartel’s media influence.
These information campaigns can play a vital role in protecting
American lives, dismantling criminal networks, and safeguarding

the nation by effectively warning potential drug traffickers of the
severe repercussions they will face.
Finally, this section appropriates $1,000,000 to the Secretary to
support commemorative events honoring meritorious contributions
and achievements related to border security, including events rec-
ognizing victims of crimes. Examples of such events include Line-
of-Duty death memorials, Department or agency anniversaries, and
commendation ceremonies. Funding in this section can be used for
venue and setup, program materials, commemoratives (e.g.,
plaques, flags, awards); and personnel and services (e.g., honor
guard, officiants, security).
Section 60004. State and Local Law Enforcement Presidential Resi-
dence Protection
This section appropriates $300,000,000 to the Administrator of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), for the reim-
bursement of law enforcement personnel costs for protection activi-
ties directly and demonstrably associated with any residence of the
President that is designated pursuant to section 3 of the Presi-
dential Protection Assistance Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–524) to be
secured by the United States Secret Service.
Continued support of the Presidential Residence Protection As-
sistance grant is essential for the continued safety of the President.
This grant provides reimbursement to state and local law enforce-
ment agencies for operational overtime costs incurred while pro-
tecting any non-governmental residence of the President of the
United States as designated or identified to be secured by the U.S.
Secret Service.
With President Trump maintaining regular travel, proper secu-
rity measures need to be maintained, particularly following the two
highly publicized assassination attempts in 2024. Assistance from
state and local law enforcement agencies is oftentimes necessary to
ensure protection of the President’s residences given limited U.S
Secret Service resources. This funding would build upon past con-
gressional appropriations and ensure that the Department of
Homeland Security has the necessary funding to reimburse and
utilize state and local law enforcement.
Section 60005. State Homeland Security Grant Program
This section appropriates funds to FEMA to be administered
under the State Homeland Security Grant Program authorized
under section 2004 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.
605), to enhance State, local, and Tribal security through grants,
contracts, cooperative agreements, and other activities. Appropria-
tions in this section include: $500,000,000 for State and local capa-
bilities to detect, identify, track, or monitor threats from unmanned
aircraft systems (UAS) (as such term is defined in section 44801 of
title 49, United States Code); $625,000,000 for security, planning,
and other costs related to the 2026 FIFA World Cup;
$1,000,000,000 for security, planning, and other costs related to the
2028 Olympics and Paralympics; and $450,000,000 for the Oper-
ation Stonegarden Grant Program.
The Committee believes it is essential to continue to pursue ef-
forts to enhance counter-UAS capabilities and authorities for fed-

eral, State, and local law enforcement. As the capabilities and
availability of commercially available drone technology have made
significant advances in recent years, the emerging homeland secu-
rity threat from such technology in the wrong hands has likewise
increased. Terrorists, criminal organizations, and foreign actors can
use drones to exploit vulnerabilities across a wide range of environ-
ments and targets for espionage or terrorist acts.
Suspicious drone incursions have occurred at military installa-
tions, sporting events, airports, critical energy facilities, and across
the Southwest border at an alarming rate. This is a critical concern
in communities nationwide, particularly for high-profile public
events and critical infrastructure. $500,000,000 in appropriations
for this grant program will support law enforcement efforts across
the United States in developing their ability to detect, identify,
track, or monitor UAS threats.
In 2026, the FIFA Would Cup will be held in eleven cities across
the United States. FIFA anticipates that at least 5,000,000 fans
will travel to the United States for the World Cup. Attendees will
include multiple heads of state and other foreign dignitaries. The
Committee recognizes the national security implications of hosting
an international sporting event of this size.
On March 7, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order
Establishing the White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup
2026, to facilitate coordination with executive departments and
agencies ‘‘to assist in the planning, organization, and execution of
the events surrounding the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and 2026
FIFA World Cup.’’ To support President Trump’s priority of the
safety and security of events held on American soil, the Committee
believes an appropriation of $625,000,000 for grants related to this
event will enhance planning and security related to the 2026 FIFA
World Cup. These funds will be made available through FEMA’s
State Homeland Security Grant Program, which assists State,
local, and Tribal efforts to build, sustain, and deliver the capabili-
ties necessary to prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond
to acts of terrorism.
Two years following the FIFA World Cup, the 2028 Summer
Olympics and 2028 Summer Paralympics will be held in the great-
er Los Angeles area. The Committee believes an appropriation of
$1,000,000,000 for grants to be made available for security, plan-
ning, and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics and Paralympic
Games, made available through FEMA’s State Homeland Security
Grant Program, will have a vital impact on the security of our na-
tion in preparation for and throughout the Olympic Games and
Paralympic Games.
Already in 2024, the Department of Homeland Security des-
ignated the Olympic and Paralympic Games a National Special Se-
curity Event (NSSE), the furthest in advance that a NSSE has ever
been granted. This designation is based in part on the event’s sig-
nificance, size, and anticipated attendance, allowing for significant
resources from the federal government, as well as from state and
local partners, to be utilized in a comprehensive security plan. The
U.S. Secret Service is designated as the lead federal agency respon-
sible for coordinating, planning, exercising, and implementing secu-

rity for NSSEs through the Presidential Threat Protection Act of
2000.
Operation Stonegarden is part of FEMA’s Homeland Security
Grant Program, which provides funding to state, local, tribal, and
territorial (SLTT) law enforcement agencies that are located along
the borders of the United States to improve overall border security.
Over the last four years, the United States faced a historic border
crisis with communities and local law enforcement along the South-
west border bearing the brunt of the hardship due to the chaos
brought on by failed border policies.
Operation Stonegarden is an essential part in the overall ad-
vancement of security along our borders. An addition of
$450,000,000 in funding for this grant program will allow the De-
partment of Homeland Security to further enhance its relationship
with law enforcement, implementing a layered approach to secure
our land and maritime borders from traffickers and smugglers.
This grant program provides cooperation and coordination among
U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s U.S. Border Patrol and fed-
eral, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies by
providing funding to support joint efforts to secure the United
States’ borders, especially in states bordering Mexico and Canada,
as well as in states and territories with international water bor-
ders.
DISSENTING VIEWS OF COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY
DEMOCRATS
During the markup of the House Republican reconciliation pack-
age, Homeland Security Committee Democrats offered 34 amend-
ments that addressed a range of concerns ignored in the disastrous
underlying legislation, which was the Committee’s piece of the larg-
er, extreme Trump agenda, containing $7 trillion in giveaways to
billionaires and big corporations and $880 billion in cuts to Med-
icaid.
The amendments—which ranged from prohibiting the Trump ad-
ministration from illegally deporting U.S. citizens to upholding the
supremacy of the Supreme Court to prohibiting cuts to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), among many others-ad-
dressed the Trump administration’s abuse of its mass deportation
agenda that has sent American citizen children with cancer to
South America; its dismantling of the Department of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS); and its blatant mismanagement of the Department
since taking office in January 2025.
Committee Republicans could neither promote nor defend their
legislation or their party’s administration. They chose silence in-
stead.
On Tuesday, April 29, 2025, Committee Democrats fought for due
process for migrants and American citizens alike. We fought for a
strong DHS that did not ignore its responsibilities to keep Ameri-
cans safe. We fought against handouts to billionaires and budget
cuts for victims of disasters. We fought for our communities and
the rule of law.
Republicans, meanwhile, leaned back in their chairs for more
than 5 hours and waited in deafening silence to rubber stamp the
worst excesses of a Trump administration that has proven it cannot

be trusted. They waited to approve tens of billions of funds for a
border wall President Trump once claimed would be paid for by
Mexico.
Having rejected all the Democratic amendments during the Com-
mittee’s consideration of this fast-tracked legislation, we implore
our colleagues to do a little soul searching before voting to advance
this legislation any further. We continue to believe that our coun-
try is better than what is represented in a bill that provides tax
cuts for billionaires while denying the most vulnerable basic
healthcare.
DEPORTATIONS
Committee Democrats put forward dozens of amendments to pro-
tect the American people as the Trump administration recklessly
and cruelly implements its mass deportation agenda. Under Presi-
dent Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS is detaining and de-
porting American children with terminal cancer, punishing stu-
dents for engaging in protected First Amendment activity, and de-
nying due process to individuals, including those in the country le-
gally.
Ranking Member Thompson offered an amendment to prevent
funds in the legislation from being used to remove American citi-
zens from the United States, except for compliance with treaty obli-
gations and Federal extradition laws and policies. Committee Re-
publicans unanimously voted against this amendment. Committee
Republicans similarly rejected Democratic amendments that would
have prohibited DHS from removing U.S. children—including those
with cancer—veterans who served in the U.S. military and were
honorably discharged, the spouses of active duty servicemembers,
and pregnant women.
Committee Republicans also uniformly opposed Rep. Magaziner’s
amendment to prohibit deporting Americans to foreign prisons, in-
cluding El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center
(CECOT). Committee Republicans then rejected Rep. Ramirez’s
amendment to prohibit deporting immigrants to third-country pris-
ons, along with Rep. Garcia’s amendment to prohibit removing im-
migrants under the Alien Enemies Act without due process.
Committee Democrats are appalled by the Trump administra-
tion’s actions to send individuals to dangerous foreign prisons
where they have no chance at due process or proving their inno-
cence. Many of these individuals have never been convicted of a
crime or had their day in court, in contravention of the U.S. Con-
stitution.1 President Trump has threatened to expand these illegal
disappearances to U.S. citizens. In a meeting with President
Bukele of El Salvador, he stated ‘‘The homegrowns are next, the
homegrowns.’’ Trump then instructed El Salvador’s president to
‘‘build about five more places,’’ to imprison the ‘‘homegrowns.’’2
Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the American
people and the rule of law. By rejecting Democratic amendments,
Committee Republicans made clear that no person is safe in Amer-

ica under the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.
Even American children undergoing cancer treatment are fair tar-
gets for Republicans and the Trump administration.
Rep. Magaziner also offered an amendment to ensure that no
funds would be used to prevent an individual from seeking or meet-
ing with legal counsel when being questioned or detained by immi-
gration enforcement authorities. Republicans voted this down. Rep.
Ramirez also offered an amendment prohibiting the Trump admin-
istration from reinstating family separation at the border. Repub-
licans opposed this amendment.
Rep. Carter offered an amendment to prohibit DHS from detain-
ing and removing any non-citizen for exercising their First Amend-
ment right to free speech. If individuals like Ru¨meysa O¨ztu¨rk and
Mahmoud Khalil are jailed and deported for exercising their First
Amendment rights, then any person in this country is under threat
for doing the same thing. Republicans also voted this amendment
down.
Rep. McIver and Rep. Johnson offered amendments to protect
international students studying at American universities. Under
the Trump administration, thousands of international students had
their legal status terminated or visas revoked without trans-
parency or justification, causing fear and chaos across the country.
In some cases, students and their universities were not even noti-
fied of their change in status. These Democratic amendments
would have ensured transparency and due process for students
studying in the United States, yet Republicans unanimously re-
jected them.
Rep. Ramirez offered an amendment preventing Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) from facilitating the transfer of migrants
to Guantanamo Bay, a facility that President Trump promised
would hold ‘‘the worst of the worst.’’ Instead, the Trump adminis-
tration wasted $40 million to temporarily jail there approximately
400 detainees, most of whom are nonviolent, low-risk individuals
with no serious criminal records.3 Committee Republicans, who
claim to be against waste and abuse, voted against this amend-
ment.
Rep. Kennedy also offered an amendment aimed at protecting
American consumers and the economic vibrancy of our commu-
nities, which are heavily reliant on trade with Canada. His amend-
ment would have prevented funds from being used to enforce tariffs
on Canada, which raise the cost of everyday goods for the American
people.
When the Trump administration spends its resources harassing,
rounding up, and deporting American citizens, legal permanent
residents, and international students in the name of border secu-
rity, it is ignoring real threats from terrorism, domestic violent ex-
tremism, and gun violence. It is also putting at risk Americans who
rely on government programs, like Medicaid, Social Security and
FEMA’s disaster relief programs, which Republicans would gut to
fund the administration’s campaign of terror and intimidation.

Furthermore, taxpayers should not foot the bill for failed cam-
paign promises. This bill includes an additional $46.5 billion to con-
struct the border wall that President Trump promised Mexico
would pay for.4 Republicans propose spending ten times the
amount on Trump’s failed border wall as they do on CBP per-
sonnel. Committee Democrats support the use of more efficient bor-
der security technologies to catch and detect smugglers and inter-
dict drugs. Yet when Rep. Correa offered an amendment enabling
funding in the bill to be used for new, innovative technologies, Re-
publicans opposed that effort.
Health Care in CBP Custody
Democrats support funding for CBP to provide adequate health
care to detainees in its custody, but Republicans rejected Rep.
Thanedar’s amendment to provide $1.8 billion over 5 years to do
so. In 2018, two young children died in CBP custody within months
of each other,5 and a third child died in CBP custody in 2023.6
After the 2023 death, CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility
found numerous breakdowns in the child’s health care.7 Rep.
Thanedar’s amendment would have provided CBP the funding it
needs to ensure adequate health care for detainees, but Repub-
licans rejected the amendment.
DISMANTLING DHS
Committee Republicans did not just oppose commonsense amend-
ments to stop cruel deportations. They also rejected amendments
aimed at ending the Trump administration’s wholesale dismantling
of the Nation’s homeland security and disaster response and recov-
ery enterprise.
Republicans Wish to Abolish FEMA
The Republican reconciliation package completely neglects the
fact that the Trump administration has started executing a plan to
abolish FEMA. Secretary Noem and other officials in the Trump
administration continue to openly discuss dismantling FEMA,
which is the one agency dedicated to assisting Americans in the
aftermath of disasters.8 In a March 2025 televised Cabinet meet-
ing, Secretary Noem even proudly declared, ‘‘We’re going to elimi-
nate FEMA.’’9 Secretary Noem’s remarks on eliminating FEMA
come at a time when reports say FEMA will be short staffed by 20

percent at the start of hurricane season, largely due to Elon Musk’s
staffing schemes and politically motivated firings.10
In addition to weakening the FEMA workforce, the administra-
tion is unlawfully withholding billions of Federal disaster response,
flood mitigation, and wildfire prevention grant funding even as
court orders have instructed the Agency to immediately disburse
the funding.11 Committee Republicans rejected an amendment of-
fered by Rep. Pou that would have prohibited implementing a proc-
ess that delays or withholds the disbursement of funds made avail-
able in the measure. In April, the Trump administration an-
nounced that it was canceling nearly $4.5 billion in mitigation
funding awards to communities across the country in from the
Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) pro-
gram—which is congressionally authorized and appropriated fund-
ing for mitigation projects.12 Furthermore, political retribution is
reportedly influencing key FEMA decisions on the allocation of as-
sistance and determining which communities receive aid. Report-
edly, FEMA employees are now saying that the Agency 1s politi-
cizing ‘‘grant funds and disaster assistance like we’ve never seen
before.’’13
Committee Republicans unanimously rejected all the amend-
ments offered by Democrats that would have addressed the Trump
administration’s planned elimination of FEMA and the deleterious
decisions at the Agency, including an amendment offered by Resi-
dent Commissioner Herna´ndez that would have explicitly included
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, local, Tribal, and other terri-
torial entities within the title’s Homeland Security Grant Program
section. This markup was another missed opportunity for the Com-
mittee to do its part to address the misguided effort to dismantle
FEMA. At a minimum, Committee Republicans are complicit in the
Trump administration’s assault on Federal disaster relief and
emergency support for Americans.
DHS MISMANAGEMENT
The Trump administration has paired dismantling DHS with
mismanaging it. Committee Democrats attempted to draw high-
light Republican failures to uphold the rule of law, strengthen cy-
bersecurity, protect DHS systems from foreign interference through
the official use of commercial messaging apps like Signal to share
operationally sensitive information, and protect DHS workers.
Respect for the Rule of Law
Republicans’ reconciliation package gives massive amounts of
money to the Trump administration without accountability or
guardrails to protect the Constitution and laws of the United
States. The Trump administration has repeatedly engaged in ac-

tivities that conflict with decisions and orders of American courts,
including the Supreme Court of the United States.14 For example,
the Trump administration wrongfully deported a Maryland man
despite an immigration judge having granted him a withholding of
removal.15 The Supreme Court stepped in and ordered the Trump
administration to ‘‘facilitate’’ the man’s release from custody in El
Salvador and ensure that his case is handled as it would have been
had he not been improperly deported.16 The Trump administration
has ignored the Supreme Court,17 and President Trump has said
that he does not know whether he is required to comply with the
Constitution.18
There is no doubt that the Trump administration has—and will
continue to-ignore the courts and Constitution. The reconciliation
package essentially funds the Trump administration’s lawlessness,
and Republicans rejected Rep. Thanedar’s amendments to prevent
DHS funding from being used to engage in actions that conflict
with court opinions or orders. Republicans are willing to spend tax-
payer dollars on the diminution of the courts, laws, and Constitu-
tion of the United States, despite Democratic and democratic objec-
tions.
Ignoring Cybersecurity
On the matter of cybersecurity, once again, Republicans say one
thing a do another. Despite the Chairman’s pronouncement that
the 119th Congress would be devoted to improving the Nation’s cy-
bersecurity, there is not one penny in the Homeland Security Com-
mittee’s reconciliation title devoted to the issue. And, although the
Committee did not allocate the full $90 billion allotted to it in the
budget resolution, Republicans unanimously rejected an amend-
ment offered by Rep. Magaziner that would have provided funding
to rehire and retain highly sought-after employees at the Cyberse-
curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) the Trump ad-
ministration indiscriminately fired or harassed into quitting in
order to pass off the savings as tax cuts to billionaires. They also
rejected an amendment by Rep. Swalwell that would have barred
the Department from including veterans—among best trained and
most devoted public employees in the Federal Government—from
being included in reductions in force.
If the Chairman is waiting to find his so-called ‘‘cyber border’’ be-
fore investing in cybersecurity, he will be waiting a long time, and
Americans will pay the price. This tone-deaf reconciliation package
ignores serious threats facing the Nation—including cyber threats
from Russia, China and its typhoon campaign, Iran, and cyber
criminals-while turning a blind eye to the administration’s reckless

dismantling of America’s cybersecurity agency. From election secu-
rity, to threat hunting, to security by design, the Trump adminis-
tration is gutting the core services CISA offers governments and
the private sector alike, and Committee Republicans do not care.
Failing the Workforce
The Republican reconciliation package provides tens of billions of
dollars to OHS for border security at the same time as the Trump
administration undermines the government workers who actually
protect the homeland. Rep. Correa proposed an amendment to pro-
hibit OHS from using its funding to harm homeland security work-
ers by undermining or canceling collective bargaining agreements,
but Republicans rejected that amendment. Meanwhile, President
Trump issued an executive order undermining collective bargaining
at OHS agencies like USCIS and ICE,19 and Secretary Noem an-
nounced that OHS would cancel its collective bargaining agreement
with the union representing TSA Officers.20 The Republican rec-
onciliation scam is a giveaway that will harm workers, and Repub-
licans are complicit.
Drug Trafficking
The Republican reconciliation package seeks to combat drug traf-
ficking across our borders but fails to address the very things that
fuel drug traffickers: guns and bulk cash. Firearms and bulk
amounts of cash are consistently smuggled out of America and into
Mexico. The outbound flow of weapons and cash to fuel cartel vio-
lence is a real threat. Just recently, CBP officers in Del Rio seized
nine weapons, 260 rounds of ammunition, 24 magazines, and weap-
ons’ components hidden in two vehicles traveling to Mexico.21 A
few weeks prior, officers at the same port of entry found 16 fire-
arms, including three assault rifles, 26 magazines, and 182 rounds
of ammunition hidden in another van.22 Moreover, in Texas, CBP
officers recently seized over $270,000 dollars in unreported cur-
rency from a single Toyota headed to Mexico.23 The seized weapons
and cash could have easily gone into the hands of cartel members,
furthering drug trafficking and other criminal operations. Without
a mandate and resources for CBP to improve its outbound inspec-
tions program, the administration’s crackdown on the drug trade is
mere talk. Securing the southern border and countering drug traf-
ficking means making sure U.S. officials are inspecting both what

is entering and what is leaving the country, and the Republican
legislation fails to address the latter.
Signalgate
Foreign intelligence services work around the clock to gain access
to sensitive U.S. homeland and national security information. The
targeting of senior government officials to elicit such information is
one method used by foreign adversaries to do this. On March 24,
our foreign adversaries learned that they may not have to work so
hard to target the most senior national security officials in the
country when it was revealed that the highest-ranking Trump ad-
ministration officials had used the commercial messaging app Sig-
nal to discuss highly sensitive and classified information and inad-
vertently added a journalist to the text message chain.
The Trump administration and House Republicans want the
American people to believe that nothing classified was discussed on
these chats, but the American people know better. It is clear from
the lack of investigations and introduced articles of impeachment
related to the egregious national security breach—and Mike
Waltz’s recent promotion to nominee for UN ambassador—that
House Republicans and the Trump administration could not care
less about protecting information that, if disclosed, could damage
our national security and harm our U.S. service men and women.
This is also evident from the fact that the Republican reconciliation
package allocated zero dollars for DHS counterintelligence pro-
grams, projects, or activities to detect, deter, and disrupt foreign in-
telligence threats.
CONCLUSION
Committee Republicans chose silence over addressing pressing
concerns regarding unlawful deportations, the haphazard disman-
tling of DHS without legislative mandate, and the amateurish mis-
management of the Department. They have chosen to spend $69
billion in hard-earned taxpayer money to make more palatable
deep cuts to Medicaid and to cut the taxes of billionaires.
Regardless of what these funds in the reconciliation package
could potentially do if put in the right hands, the Trump adminis-
tration has proven itself incompetent and unreliable at best and an
enemy of the Constitution and Congress’s power of the purse at
worst. Trump and Noem are unconstitutionally dismantling DHS—
firing hundreds of civil servants, freezing grants, eliminating the
watchdogs who protect Americans, and failing to respond to Hurri-
cane Helene’s devastation in North Carolina. There is no guarantee
that the money included this package would be spent the way it
is laid out in the Committee Print—or anywhere else in the Repub-
lican legislative agenda. Moreover, congressional Republicans have
also proven themselves wholly incapable of any oversight of this
administration. Even worse, the Homeland Security Committee has
embarked on this massive spending plan without having first held
a hearing with Secretary Noem and scrutinizing her priorities and
the Department’s needs. The Committee scheduled its first meeting
with the Secretary for more than 2 weeks after marking up this
funding package.

same time, the number of aliens in the U.S. with final orders of
removal grew to nearly 1.5 million.2 For four years, untold scores
of otherwise removable aliens were allowed to remain in the United
States because the previous Administration did not classify them
as ‘‘priorities’’ for removal.3
The Biden-Harris Administration made it nearly impossible to
remove illegal aliens from the United States. In September 2021,
then-Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Mayorkas
issued a memorandum entitled ‘‘Guidelines for the Enforcement of
Civil Immigration Law’’ (‘‘Mayorkas Memo’’), which outlined three
enforcement priorities: national security, public safety, and border
security.4 The Mayorkas Memo began with the assumption that
‘‘undocumented noncitizens’’ work hard and contribute to ‘‘our com-
munities’’ and that ‘‘bipartisan groups’’ have ‘‘tried to pass legisla-
tion that would provide a path to citizenship or other lawful status
for the approximately 11 million undocumented noncitizens’’ in the
country.5 From that premise, Secretary Mayorkas articulated a
new policy that the mere fact that aliens are removable pursuant
to U.S. law ‘‘should not alone be the basis of an enforcement action
against them.’’6 Under the Mayorkas Memo, for instance, ‘‘[b]efore
ICE officers [could] arrest and detain aliens as a threat to public
safety, they [were] now required to conduct an assessment of the
individual and the totality of facts and circumstances, including
various aggravating or mitigating factors.’’7 In this assessment,
ICE officers were prohibited from relying solely on the fact of an
alien’s conviction, regardless of the seriousness of the underlying
crime.8 After listing certain aggravating and mitigating factors, the
Mayorkas Memo stated that the listed factors were ‘‘not exhaus-
tive’’ and that ‘‘the overriding question is whether the noncitizen
poses a current threat to public safety.’’9 The Mayorkas Memo also
did not presumptively subject aliens with aggravated felony convic-
tions to enforcement action or detention.10
As a result of the Mayorkas Memo and the Biden-Harris Admin-
istration’s refusal to enforce immigration laws, ICE administrative
arrests and interior removals dropped off a cliff. In fiscal year
2018, under the first Trump Administration, ICE made 158,581 ad-
ministrative arrests of aliens in the United States.11 Those arrests
included 105,140 convicted criminals; 32,977 with pending criminal

charges; and 20,464 with other immigration violations.12 During
the same time, ICE removed 95,360 aliens from the interior of the
United States.13 The Biden-Harris Administration reversed course,
arresting only 36,322 convicted criminals and only 10,074 with
pending criminal charges in fiscal year 2022.14 The drop in remov-
als was even more staggering, with only 28,204 interior removals
in fiscal year 2022.15
Although the Biden-Harris Administration boasted that its ‘‘over-
all removals’’ in fiscal year 2024 (271,484) exceeded the Trump Ad-
ministration’s overall removals in fiscal year 2019 (267,258), this
increase is solely because there were more illegal aliens arriving at
the border, being arrested by CBP, and being immediately removed
or allowed to return to Mexico.16 The removal numbers were not
indicative of increased enforcement compared to the first Trump
Administration and were only a fraction of the more than two mil-
lion illegal aliens encountered at the southwest border in fiscal
year 2024.17 In fact, removals of aliens from the interior of the U.S.
remained significantly lower in fiscal year 2024 than in the last
full, non-COVID year of the first Trump Administration. In fiscal
year 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration removed from the inte-
rior of the country only 47,732 aliens, compared to 85,958 interior
removals in fiscal year 2019.18 At the same time, the Biden-Harris
Administration removed far fewer criminal aliens from the interior
of the U.S. compared to the Trump Administration. For example,
in fiscal year 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration removed only
36,279 convicted criminals from the interior compared to 64,991 re-
moved in 2019.19
Record border encounters also led to a drop in arrests of aliens
from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024.20 In highlighting how
both at-large arrests—ICE interior arrests that are made in the
community and not in a controlled environment like a jail—and
overall arrests of aliens dropped from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year
2024, ICE admitted that a ‘‘focus on border cases impacted routine
interior enforcement operations.’’21 In other words, because of the
Biden-Harris border crisis, more criminal aliens were allowed to re-
main in the United States. In fact, in fiscal year 2024, the Biden-
Harris Administration made fewer at-large arrests of criminal
aliens (14,851) than the Trump Administration in fiscal year 2019
(25,421).22 Likewise, overall arrests of criminal aliens were far
lower in fiscal year 2024 (81,312) than in fiscal year 2019

(123,128).23 Meanwhile, the number of aliens on ICE’s non-de-
tained docket soared to more than 7.6 million, a 135 percent in-
crease from the end of fiscal year 2020, just before President Biden
and Vice President Harris took office.24
Accordingly, with thousands of criminal and otherwise removable
aliens left roaming the streets due to the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion’s policies, the Trump Administration today has been left with
a tall task to enforce the immigration laws. The Committee’s rec-
onciliation package will give ICE the necessary resources to enforce
current immigration law.
Adult alien detention capacity and family residential centers
Currently, ICE is funded through annual appropriations for de-
tention beds sufficient to support an average daily population of
41,500 single adult aliens.25 While the Trump Administration
reconfigured resources and currently has detention space for nearly
50,000 aliens,26 and has worked creatively to increase the amount
of detention available to the agency,27 a large increase in the num-
ber of detention beds is necessary to effectuate the President’s im-
migration agenda. The Trump Administration also seeks to expand
family residential center capacity. The Biden-Harris Administra-
tion, in line with its other policies that completely disregarded the
enforcement of immigration laws, generally released family units
into the United States.28 In fact, by December 2021, ‘‘ICE stopped
housing families entirely.’’29 Although the Biden-Harris Adminis-
tration briefly considered resuming family detention,30 the outcry
from open-borders activists31 scuttled those plans.32
Knowing that the Biden-Harris Administration would give them
a free pass into the United States, family units arrived at the
southwest border in record numbers. During fiscal year 2019, CBP
apprehended 473,682 aliens who were part of a family unit.33 In
fiscal year 2020, during the COVID–19 pandemic, CBP encoun-

tered 70,994 aliens who were part of a family unit.34 In fiscal year
2021, that number soared to 478,492;35 in fiscal year 2022,
560,646; in fiscal year 2023, 821,537; and in fiscal year 2024, CBP
encountered 804,456 aliens who were part of a family unit.36
For years, cartels have exploited children to attempt entry into
the United States. During the first Trump Administration, then-
Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan described how ‘‘illegal
aliens were coached and mentored and given what to say by the
cartels and the human smuggling organizations: You grab a kid,
and that is your U.S. passport.’’37 After President Biden took office,
cartels took advantage of the Biden-Harris Administration’s poli-
cies related to the mass release of family units. According to a re-
port by the New York Post, cartels split up minors from their par-
ents and then had cartel members pose as the minors’ relatives to
ensure quick entry into the United States.38
The Committee’s reconciliation package provides ICE with funds
to increase adult alien detention capacity and family residential
center capacity. The Committee’s reconciliation package also pro-
vides funding for short-term detention space for adult aliens who
are charged with illegal entry so that the aliens can be detained
with the alien minors who entered the United States with them.
Ground and air transportation
To effectuate the President’s removal goals, an increase in
ground and air transportation is also needed. The Committee’s rec-
onciliation package provides funds to increase ICE removal oper-
ations, including amounts necessary for ground transportation, air
charters to return aliens to their home countries, commercial air
costs associated with in-country transfers, transportation of unac-
companied alien children (UAC), and ensuring other departures of
aliens.
ICE personnel
The Committee’s reconciliation package provides funds to hire
additional ICE officers, agents, and support personnel to enforce
current immigration law. Personnel to be hired include new law en-
forcement officers involved in case management, detention, inves-
tigations, and removals. In addition, the Committee’s proposal
funds support-staff positions to allow ICE to complete its enforce-
ment functions more efficiently.

ICE trial attorneys at the Office of the Principal Legal Advi-
sor
The process to remove an alien from the United States usually
involves an ICE attorney prosecuting the alien’s removal case be-
fore an immigration judge in immigration court.39 ICE attorneys,
through the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA), are the
‘‘exclusive representative of DHS in immigration removal pro-
ceedings before [EOIR], litigating all removal cases.’’40 OPLA ‘‘is
the largest legal program in DHS, with more than 1,700 attorneys
and nearly 300 support personnel.’’41
The Biden-Harris Administration upended OPLA’s role in pros-
ecuting immigration cases and directed ICE attorneys to support
the Administration’s open-borders agenda. On April 3, 2022, Kerry
Doyle, the DHS official who at the time oversaw OPLA, issued a
memorandum (‘‘Doyle Memo’’) to ICE attorneys directing them to
promote the closure and dismissal of cases, particularly given the
immigration court backlog.42 The Doyle Memo outlined how ICE
attorneys were ‘‘expected to exercise discretion’’—that is, move to
dismiss immigration cases—‘‘at all stages of the enforcement proc-
ess.’’43 In other words, ICE attorneys were expected to ensure that
certain aliens’ cases never moved forward in immigration court so
the Biden-Harris Administration could achieve its open-borders
agenda.
Through the Doyle Memo, the Biden-Harris Administration gave
ICE attorneys a playbook for ensuring countless cases disappeared
from the immigration court docket or, as the Doyle Memo framed
it, ‘‘efficiently remov[ing] nonpriority cases from the docket alto-
gether.’’44 For cases that were not a priority—meaning cases that
ICE attorneys determined did not qualify as a threat to national
security, public safety, or border security—the Doyle Memo speci-
fied that ICE attorneys should not file a Notice to Appear in the
cases.45 If DHS does not file a Notice to Appear in a case, DHS
does not initiate immigration court removal against those par-
ticular aliens.46 In non-priority cases in which immigration court
proceedings have already begun, the Doyle Memo instructed ICE
attorneys to seek to dismiss proceedings or ‘‘consider alternative
forms of prosecutorial discretion, including administrative closure,
stipulations to issues or relief, continuances, not pursuing an ap-
peal, joining motions to reopen, and stipulations in bond hear-

(DHS) has been able to file a Notice to Appear with the immigration court. For example, DHS
may serve a Notice to Appear, which contains a hearing date, on a respondent, but not file the
Notice to Appear with the court until sometime later. Where DHS has not filed the Notice to
Appear with the court by the time of the first hearing, this is known as a ‘failure to prosecute.’
If there is a failure to prosecute, the respondent and counsel may be excused until DHS files
the Notice to Appear with the court, at which time a hearing is scheduled.’’ Id.

ings.’’47 In both cases, ICE attorneys’ actions ensured that an alien
would not be removed from the United States.
Because of the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies, the work-
load for OPLA attorneys is now higher than ever. The numbers tell
the story: During the Biden-Harris Administration, immigration
judges dismissed, terminated, or administratively closed hundreds
of thousands of cases,48 most of which will likely need to be re-
opened or restarted so OPLA attorneys can pursue the aliens’ re-
movals from the United States. With an immigration court backlog
of more than 4 million cases,49 OPLA requires even more man-
power to prosecute the millions of new cases that flooded the sys-
tem under the Biden-Harris Administration. Meanwhile, a 2024
DHS report revealed how OPLA already had to ‘‘implement[] new
virtual capabilities to address attorney shortages relative to the ex-
pansion’’ of the number of immigration judges.50
The Committee’s reconciliation package provides funding to the
Trump Administration to hire additional OPLA attorneys to rep-
resent DHS in removal proceedings and staff necessary to support
such attorneys.
ICE HIRING AND RETENTION BONUSES
Like many law enforcement agencies, in the wake of anti-police
sentiment fomented by activists on the left, ICE has faced recruit-
ing and retention challenges. In addition to the challenge posed by
general anti-law enforcement sentiment, immigration activists fre-
quently vilify ICE for simply doing their jobs. Recently, in Los An-
geles, for example, ICE agents were doxed by anti-immigration ac-
tivists.51 These kinds of actions can result in threats against indi-
vidual officers, making it difficult not only for ICE to complete its
mission but for the agency to maintain an appropriate level of
staffing. The Committee’s reconciliation package provides funding
for $10,000 hiring and retention bonuses for ICE personnel. The
hiring bonuses require newly hired personnel to commit to at least
two years of service with ICE. The retention bonuses require per-
sonnel to commit to five additional years of service with ICE. This
section provides ICE discretion in awarding retention bonuses due
to issues with certain statutory pay caps. The Committee’s proposal
further provides that qualifying individuals will enter into written
service agreements with ICE that include relevant terms and con-
ditions.

287(G) PROGRAM
Current immigration law empowers state and local law enforce-
ment agencies to partner with ICE to investigate, apprehend, or
detain illegal aliens.52 Under section 287(g) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA), the federal government may enter into writ-
ten agreements with state and local agencies, through which law
enforcement officers ‘‘may carry out’’ immigration enforcement-re-
lated functions ‘‘at the expense of the [s]tate . . . and to the extent
consistent with [s]tate and local law.’’53 The program is known as
the 287(g) program.54 According to ICE, the 287(g) program gives
the agency the ability ‘‘to enhance collaboration with state and
local law enforcement partners to protect the homeland through
the arrest and removal of aliens who undermine the safety of our
nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration
laws.’’55 Law enforcement agencies ‘‘interested in participating in
the 287(g) [p]rogram must sign a[] [memorandum of agreement]
with ICE’’ and ‘‘nominate officers to participate in the 287(g)
[p]rogram.’’56
ICE uses three types of 287(g) agreements: the Jail Enforcement
Model (JEM); the Warrant Service Officer Model (WSO); and the
Task Force Model (TFM).57 The models include varying degrees of
immigration authority:
• The Jail Enforcement Model ‘‘delegates certain authority to
state and local law enforcement agencies to identify criminal aliens
and immigration violators in local custody and place them into im-
migration proceedings.’’58
• The Warrant Service Officer Model ‘‘provides legal authority to
state and local law enforcement officers to execute civil immigra-
tion warrants on behalf of [Enforcement and Removal Operations]
within the confines of their detention facilities.’’59
• The Task Force Model ‘‘serves as a force multiplier for state
and local law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration
authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.’’60
As of May 1, 2025, ICE had entered into 287(g) JEM agreements

2024, 287(g) WSO agreements resulted in 817 arrests,62 with 1,819
removals facilitated through 287(g) JEM agreements.63
The Committee’s reconciliation package provides additional fund-
ing for the 287(g) program. In doing so, this section funds the
Trump Administration’s efforts to arrest, detain, and remove crimi-
nal aliens from the United States in accordance with current immi-
gration law and ensure safer streets for every American.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’/Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)
During his first term, President Trump implemented a new pro-
gram called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), also known as
‘‘Remain in Mexico,’’ which addressed the increasing number of
aliens illegally crossing the border.64 Based on existing statutory
authority,65 MPP was designed for ‘‘certain aliens attempting to
enter the U.S. illegally or without documentation, including those
who claim[ed] asylum. . . .’’66 The first Trump Administration ex-
plained that those aliens would ‘‘no longer be released into the
country. . . . Instead, [the] aliens [would] be given a ‘Notice to Ap-
pear’ for their immigration court hearing and [would] be returned
to Mexico until their hearing date.’’67
The Committee’s reconciliation package provides funding to sup-
port MPP.
Protect Americans from criminal UACs
UACs are, in general, initially encountered at the border by CBP
officials.68 Within 72 hours of encountering a UAC, CBP officials
must transfer the UAC to the Department of Health and Human
Services’ (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). Under the
Biden-Harris Administration, CBP did not fingerprint aliens under
the age of 14 and did not sufficiently vet UACs.
The Committee’s reconciliation package funds a DHS pilot pro-
gram to ensure DHS checks every UAC for gang-related tattoos
and contacts the consulate or embassy of the UAC’s home country
to determine if the UAC has a criminal history. Kayla Hamilton’s
killer, a UAC, had gang tattoos, was previously arrested in his
home country for his affiliation with MS–13, and admitted to com-
mitting additional murders and rapes, but was released because
multiple federal agencies failed to conduct these checks.69

Miscellaneous
State and local participation in homeland security efforts
Shortly after taking office on January 20, 2025, President Trump
issued an executive order (EO) entitled ‘‘Protecting the American
People Against Invasion.’’73 The EO details how the Biden-Harris
Administration ‘‘invited, administrated, and oversaw an unprece-
dented flood of illegal immigration into the United States.’’74 The
EO announced that the official policy of the United States would
be ‘‘faithfully execut[ing] the immigration laws against all inadmis-
sible and removable aliens.’’75 The EO details several specific steps
the Administration will take in furtherance of this policy, including
the establishment of Federal Homeland Security Task Forces
(FHSTFs).76 Each FHSTF will include representation from relevant
federal agencies and state and local law enforcement.77
The Committee’s reconciliation package funds state and local
participation in efforts to ‘‘end the presence of criminal cartels,
gangs, and transnational criminal organizations,’’ ‘‘dismantle cross-
border human smuggling and trafficking networks,’’ and use ‘‘all
available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigra-
tion laws,’’ as outlined in the FHSTF EO.78

UAC bed space
Under current funding levels, ORR has a bed capacity of roughly
9,000 UAC beds. The Committee’s reconciliation package funds
UAC bed space necessary to support increased capacity at HHS
ORR for the pendency of such UACs’ immigration court pro-
ceedings and to prevent hasty, unsafe releases that endanger both
UACs and the public. The amounts funded in the Committee’s pro-
posals presume that the annual base of $6.1 billion for UAC bed
space and other related costs in connection with the UAC program
will continue to be funded in the appropriations process.

UAC sponsor information
At the same time as record UAC encounters, the Biden-Harris
Administration loosened safety standards for the placement of
UACs with sponsors by relaxing background checks and other re-
quirements. In 2021, HHS and DHS signed a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA), replacing a previous 2018 MOA between the
two departments and removing some requirements for background
checks for potential UAC sponsors.79 The 2021 MOA removed the
requirement that ORR provide biographic and biometric data for
all adult members of a sponsor’s household to check the Federal
Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) national and statewide criminal
history, child abuse and neglect, and sex offender databases prior
to placement of a UAC.80 The Biden-Harris Administration rolled
back these security and background checks for sponsors of UACs
encountered at the southwest border so that it could move the
UACs out of government facilities more quickly.81
The Biden-Harris Administration’s rationale for cutting these
corners may have been motivated by a desire to avoid bad optics.
According to a press report, ‘‘[o]fficials said at the time they wanted
to avoid the images that had plagued the [first] Trump administra-
tion of children in severely congested facilities-widely derided as
kids in cages.’’’82 The Biden-Harris Administration’s loosening of
background check requirements was particularly alarming given
that, as ORR put it, ‘‘[t]he age of these individuals, their separation
from parents and relatives, and the hazardous journey they take
make [UACs] especially vulnerable to human trafficking, exploi-
tation, and abuse.’’83
By prioritizing speed over safety, the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion created a crisis where record numbers of UACs were placed
with inadequately vetted sponsors. On February 28, 2023, the New
York Times published an expose´ relating to HHS’s broad failure to
adequately screen sponsors of UACs and monitor them after place-
ment.84 The report included troubling comments by then-HHS Sec-
retary Xavier Becerra comparing the UAC placement process to an
assembly line.85 These failures caused UACs to be exploited and
work in extremely dangerous jobs that children are legally prohib-
ited from performing.86
On February 8, 2023, the HHS Office of the Inspector General
(OIG) released a report, ‘‘Gaps in Sponsor Screening and Follow-up
Raise Safety Concerns for Unaccompanied Children,’’ documenting

the inadequacy of sponsor vetting under the Biden-Harris Adminis-
tration.87 Specifically, the OIG found:
• Case files for 16 percent of UACs examined by the OIG
‘‘did not contain any documentation that indicated one or more
required safety checks for sponsors were conducted.’’88 In some
case files that contained references to purportedly completed
public background checks (e.g. sex offender registry name and
address checks and internet criminal public records checks) or
address checks, the OIG was unable to identify ORR-required
documentation to verify that the checks were truly com-
pleted.89
• For 19 percent of UACs in the audit whose sponsors re-
quired an FBI fingerprint check or a child abuse and neglect
registry check, the OIG found documentation in UAC’s case
files indicating that a check was initiated, but the results were
pending at the time of the children’s release—and UAC case
files were not updated to include the results of these checks
after the children’s release.90
• Of the 342 UAC case files reviewed during the OIG audit,
HHS failed to conduct required sex offender name checks in
one case and required sex offender address checks in 13
cases.91
The Trump Administration has moved swiftly to reverse course.
On February 14, 2025, ORR published guidance to ‘‘enhance the
safety of releases to sponsors, prevent fraud, and combat traf-
ficking.’’92 This guidance requires all adult sponsors and adult
household members to be fingerprinted and tightens background
check requirements for sponsors regardless of sponsor category.93
Additionally, on March 14, 2025, ORR issued guidance that ‘‘re-
quires DNA testing to support proof of relationship between a po-
tential sponsor and an unaccompanied alien child where a sponsor
purports to be biologically related to the child.’’94 On March 21,
2025, ORR further notified care providers that, in the case of UACs
in HHS custody ‘‘who either lack a Notice to Appear (NTA) or lack
an NTA that has been filled with an immigration court,’’ DHS will
issue the UAC an NTA that will ‘‘be filed with the local immigra-
tion court where the child is placed.’’95
The Committee’s reconciliation package funds a program through
which HHS will provide DHS with information regarding the UAC
sponsor and all adult residents of the sponsor’s household prior to
HHS releasing the UAC to such sponsor. Information collected will
include names, social security numbers, dates of birth, immigration
status, contact information, and background and criminal records

the residence. At a minimum, the background and criminal records
checks will include an investigation of the public records sex of-
fender registry, a public records background check, and a national

Protecting Americans from criminal UACs
As the first Trump Administration recognized, the UAC program
has for years suffered from exploitation by criminals, including
‘‘gang members who come to this country as wolves in sheep[’s]
clothing’’ and ‘‘use th[e UAC] program as a means by which to re-
cruit new members.’’96 As the Committee’s oversight has shown,
under Secretary Becerra’s leadership, HHS disregarded the poten-
tial gang affiliation of UACs who were released into the United
States.
Indeed, as revealed in the Committee’s May 2023 interim report,
in May 2022, HHS released to a sponsor a UAC named Walter
Javier Martinez, despite his previous arrest record for ‘‘illicit asso-
ciation with MS–13.’’97 Martinez went on to brutally assault and
murder 20-year-old Maryland resident Kayla Hamilton.98 Incred-
ibly, in response to requests for information about the case, on sev-
eral occasions, HHS noted to the Committee that its focus was on
protecting the privacy of Martinez, the UAC who killed Kayla
Hamilton.99 Although local police quickly identified Martinez as
the primary suspect in the murder and expressed their concern
about the threat he posed to society, Martinez was placed in a
Maryland foster home with other children and enrolled in high
school.100 Later, while in custody for Kayla’s murder, Martinez
wrote a letter in which he ‘‘admitted to committing [four] murders,
[two] rapes, and additional other crimes.’’101 Martinez has since
been sentenced to more than 70 years in prison.102 As the Harford
County, Maryland State’s Attorney said in a statement, Martinez
was ‘‘residing in our country illegally, had no legal right to be here,
preying on the members of our communities, and perpetuating the
same violent gang activity that he did in his own country.’’103
Despite having released Martinez—an illegal alien with gang tat-
toos and a history of ‘‘illicit association’’ with MS–13—to a sponsor,
HHS under the Biden-Harris Administration told the Committee

that it did not have a policy to refer known or suspected gang
members to the Justice Department for investigation or, where ap-
propriate, prosecution.104 Then-ORR Director Robin Dunn Marcos,
a senior Biden-Harris HHS official who was in charge of the UAC
program at the time, admitted that while HHS contacted the con-
sulate or embassy of UACs’ country of origin or last habitual resi-
dence to verify certain documents or claimed familial relationships,
HHS did not even request UACs’ criminal records from their home
countries.105 At the same time, the Biden-Harris Administration’s
HHS admitted that it did not have any secure facilities ‘‘in-net-
work’’—that is, facilities designed for the secure placement of UACs
who pose a danger to themselves or others or who have been deter-
mined to have a criminal record.106
The Committee’s reconciliation proposal provides HHS with fund-
ing for a pilot program to ensure HHS checks UACs for gang-re-
lated tattoos and contacts the consulate or embassy of UACs’ home
countries to determine if UACs have a criminal history.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION REVIEW
Immigration court resources
Immigration cases are initially heard before ‘‘approximately 700
immigration judges located in 71 immigration courts and three ad-
judications centers’’ across the United States.107 These courts are
housed in the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immi-
gration Review (EOIR). Immigration judges are appointed by—and
report to—the Attorney General.108 As administrative judges, im-
migration judges ‘‘are career employees with no fixed terms’’109
who decide immigration cases through the Attorney General’s dele-
gated authority.110 DHS acts as the prosecutor in immigration
court, with ICE attorneys serving ‘‘as the exclusive representative
of DHS in immigration removal proceedings before [EOIR], liti-
gating all removal cases.’’111 DHS initiates immigration court re-
moval proceedings for an alien by filing the charging document,
called a Notice to Appear, with an immigration court.112
During removal proceedings, an alien may present evidence to
the immigration judge and argue why the alien should be allowed
to remain in the U.S., either because the alien is eligible for asy-

lum or on some other ground for relief.113 If an alien disagrees
with an immigration judge’s decision, the alien may file an appeal
with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), ‘‘the highest admin-
istrative body for interpreting and applying immigration laws.’’114
Published BIA decisions ‘‘are binding on all DHS officers and
[i]mmigration [j]udges unless modified or overruled by the Attorney
General or a federal court.’’115 Because immigration courts are ad-
ministrative courts, the Executive Branch wields broad authority
over the courts’ functioning. For example, the Attorney General can
overrule BIA decisions, establish new immigration law precedent,
and adopt new policies that immigration judges must follow.116
Because of the Biden-Harris border crisis, the immigration court
case backlog ballooned exponentially. At the end of October 2020,
less than three months before President Biden and Vice President
Harris took office, EOIR had a backlog of 1.5 million cases.117 By
the time President Biden left office, the backlog reached more than
4 million cases, an increase of 167 percent.118 As the border crisis
raged, EOIR received 1.2 million new cases in fiscal year 2023 and
nearly 1.8 million new cases in fiscal year 2024, compared to 1.9
million new cases received from fiscal years 2015 through 2020
combined.119
Given the case backlog, EOIR requires additional resources, in-
cluding immigration judges, support staff, and courtrooms, to re-
store integrity, efficiency, and the rule of the law to the immigra-
tion system. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, for example, EOIR
had only 601 courtrooms nationwide, despite employing more than
700 immigration judges.120 At that time, 84 immigration judges
‘‘us[ed] remote hearing equipment units on a full-time basis,’’ with
‘‘six [immigration judges] using remote hearing equipment outside
of an EOIR space on a full-time basis, and 100 [immigration
judges] using remote hearing equipment from in-chamber units
(i.e., outside of a courtroom but inside EOIR space).’’121 Mean-
while, the Biden-Harris Administration’s immigration court offi-
cials used congressionally appropriated funding to hire additional
immigration judges without hiring sufficient support staff for either
existing judges or new judges, in an apparent effort to stack the
immigration courts with Democrat appointed judges.122 Former
EOIR Acting Director Mary Cheng ignored complaints about such
hiring.123

The Committee’s reconciliation package provides funding for
EOIR to hire immigration judges and support staff to improve the
efficiency of the nation’s immigration courts.
Miscellaneous
Reimbursement for state incarceration of criminal aliens
Criminal aliens overwhelm local, state, and federal facilities—a
problem that will only worsen following the Biden-Harris border
crisis. According to a 2018 report from the Government Account-
ability Office, at least 39,500 criminal aliens were incarcerated in
federal prisons in fiscal year 2016, with roughly 198,000 unique
criminal aliens incarcerated in federal prisons from fiscal years
2011 through 2016.124 In fiscal year 2015, at least 169,300 criminal
aliens were incarcerated in state prisons and local jails.125
Staggering as they are, these figures do not capture the entire
criminal alien population in state and local facilities, as the num-
bers only encompass criminal aliens for which a state or locality re-
ceived reimbursement through the Department of Justice’s State
Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).126 SCAAP ‘‘reim-
burses states and localities for a portion of state and local incarcer-
ation costs for criminal alien populations that meet the criteria for
reimbursement.’’127 SCAAP reimbursement, however, is only avail-
able for aliens who ‘‘(1) had at least one felony or two misdemeanor
convictions for violations of state or local law and (2) were incarcer-
ated for at least [four] consecutive days during the reporting pe-
riod.’’128 In fact, for the fiscal year 2016 SCAAP program, the De-
partment of Justice ‘‘determined that 20 percent of the incarcer-
ations for which states or localities submitted a request for SCAAP
reimbursement were ineligible for SCAAP reimbursement.’’129
The Committee’s reconciliation package provides funding to par-
tially reimburse jurisdictions for the incarceration of certain crimi-
nal aliens.
Combatting drug trafficking and illegal drug use
As illegal aliens flooded across the southwest border during the
Biden-Harris Administration, drug trafficking and illicit drug sei-
zures spiked. The Committee’s reconciliation package provides
funding to combat illegal drug trafficking, including of fentanyl and
its precursor chemicals, and illegal drug use.
IMMIGRATION FEES
The Committee’s budget reconciliation provisions also include a
series of fees. Each fee includes a provision to preclude fee waivers
or reductions. In general, fees will be credited to the U.S. Treasury
for the purpose of deficit reduction.

Asylum application fee and asylum maintenance fee
Aliens in the United States can file for asylum affirmatively with
USCIS or defensively, meaning as a defense to being removed from
the United States after the alien has been placed in removal pro-
ceedings, in one of the nation’s immigration courts.130 Under sec-
tion 208(d)(3) of the INA, fees may be imposed ‘‘for the consider-
ation of an application for asylum . . . not to exceed . . . costs in
adjudicating the applications.’’131 Currently, however, no such fee
is imposed. In addition, in general, USCIS has operated as a fee-
funded agency, based on the principle that aliens, rather than U.S.
citizens, should pay for the adjudication of immigration benefits
they seek.132 As such, because no fees are imposed on asylum ap-
plicants, fees paid by legal immigrants subsidize the cost of adjudi-
cating asylum applications at USCIS.133 At the end of fiscal year
2020, the asylum backlogs of both the immigration courts and
USCIS totaled roughly 1.1 million asylum applications.134 Today,
despite the completion, and in many cases inappropriate dismissal
or non-adjudication, of hundreds of thousands of asylum applica-
tions over the past four years, the combined asylum backlog from
EOIR and USCIS stands at more than 3 million pending applica-
tions.135
Under the first Trump Administration, USCIS published a fee
rule, attempting to charge a $50 fee on asylum applicants.136 At
the time, DHS noted that this fee was not designed to achieve even
a modicum of cost recovery for the agency, but merely to stave off
‘‘increases of other fees that must otherwise be raised to cover the
estimated full cost of adjudicating asylum applications.’’137 In other
words, the fee would merely limit the amount by which legal immi-
grants subsidize asylum application adjudications. Unsurprisingly,
immigration activist groups decried these modest changes as ‘‘dra-
matic increases that [would] immediately devastate vulnerable pop-

ulations.’’138 The Trump Administration’s fee rule was enjoined
until it was abandoned and therefore did not go into effect.139
Rather than imposing fees on the aliens backlogging the immi-
gration courts and USCIS, the Biden-Harris Administration im-
posed a $600 ‘‘Asylum Program Fee’’ on certain employers of legal
immigrant or nonimmigrant workers to offset costs associated with
the asylum program.140 However, even the Biden-Harris Adminis-
tration’s DHS noted this fee would merely ‘‘fund part of the costs
of administering the entire asylum program’’ within USCIS, which
had expenses in excess of $400 million per year as of January
2024.141
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires a $1,000 fee for
each asylum application submitted by an alien in immigration
court or with USCIS. CBO preliminarily estimated that this provi-
sion would reduce the deficit by $784 million over the 10-year win-
dow. A portion of the amounts raised will be directed to the rel-
evant agencies for cost recovery. In addition, the Committee’s pro-
posals require a $100 annual fee for each year that an alien’s asy-
lum application remains pending. CBO preliminarily estimated
that this provision would reduce the deficit by $1.1 billion over the
10-year window.
Parole fee
Section 212(d)(5) of the INA allows the DHS Secretary to grant
parole to an alien ‘‘only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humani-
tarian reasons or significant public benefit.’’142 The Biden-Harris
Administration greatly expanded the use of parole.143
Under current law, no fee is imposed on aliens paroled into the
U.S. The Committee’s reconciliation package requires a $1,000 fee
for any alien who is paroled into the U.S. other than in limited cir-
cumstances (such as medical emergencies, funerals, etc.). CBO pre-
liminarily estimated that this provision would reduce the deficit by
$49 million over the 10-year window.
Fee for illegal alien Temporary Protected Status applicants
Currently, TPS applicants pay a registration fee that is capped
at $50, in addition to a $30 biometrics services fee, although fee
waivers are available for aliens who receive means-tested public
benefits, have an income at or below 150 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, or are experiencing financial hardship.144 The Biden-

Harris Administration expanded the approval of fee waivers and
fee reductions. In fiscal years 2021 through 2023, the Biden-Harris
Administration estimated it approved 1.4 million fee waivers, total-
ing an estimated $845 million.145 According to DHS:
The increase from [fiscal year] 2022 to [fiscal year] 2023
in approved fee waivers was driven by four forms I–765
EAD (up almost 74,000 due to the humanitarian parole
programs (U4U and CHNV) and an increase in asylum fil-
ings), I–485 (up over 58,500 due to the Cuban Adjustment
areas), I–821 TPS (up over 28,500), I–765 TPS (up almost
25,000 as there were new countries, redesignations and ex-
tensions). These same four forms also increased in approv-
als each year for the last three years. The increase in re-
ceipts from FY 2022 to FY 2023 was driven by the same
four forms: I–765 EAD (up almost 81,000), I–485 (up al-
most 62,000), I–821 TPS (up over 32,500), and I–765 TPS
(up almost 28,700). All four of these forms increased each
year for the last three fiscal years.146
Illegal alien TPS applicants are not currently charged a fee spe-
cific to their TPS application. The Committee’s reconciliation pack-
age requires a $500 fee for an alien who files a TPS application and
who either (1) has not been admitted to the U.S. or (2) entered the
U.S. on a temporary visa but failed to comply with the terms of the
visa, including by not complying with the period of authorized stay.
CBO preliminarily estimated that this provision will reduce the
deficit by $2 billion over the 10-year window.
Fees relating to work authorization application, renewal, extension,
and termination for asylum applicants
Section 208(d)(3) of the INA authorizes the imposition of fees as-
sociated with the adjudication of employment authorization docu-
ments (EAD) for asylum applicants, not to exceed the cost of adju-
dication.147 Currently, however, asylum applicants who file employ-
ment authorization document applications are not charged for their
initial application, although such aliens are charged for subsequent
renewals or extensions. Depending on whether aliens file electroni-
cally or via paper, the current fee is $470 or $520.148 The first
Trump Administration attempted to charge asylum applicants the
fee charged to all aliens for initial employment authorization docu-
ment applications, $550 under the 2020 fee rule.149 DHS noted
that, at the time, ‘‘initial EAD applicants with pending asylum ap-
plications account for a large volume, approximately 13 percent’’ of

all work authorization applications.150 However, the fee rule was
tied up in litigation and ultimately abandoned before it could go
into effect.151
The Biden-Harris Administration expanded the approval of fee
waivers and fee reductions, including for employment authorization
applications (Form I–765). In fiscal years 2021 through 2023, the
Biden-Harris Administration estimated it approved 1.4 million fee
waivers or an estimated $845 million waived.152 Of those, the
Form-765 employment authorization application was the third-
highest form in terms of the total dollar amount waived.153 Be-
tween fiscal years 2021 and 2023, DHS waived nearly $150 million
in fees it otherwise would have collected for employment authoriza-
tion applications.154 In a 2024 report, the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion DHS admitted that one of the main factors driving the in-
crease in the total amount of fees waived for employment author-
ization applications was ‘‘an increase in asylum filings.’’155
USCIS’s workload with respect to employment authorization ap-
plications increased dramatically due to the number of new border
arrivals applying for work authorization during the Biden-Harris
Administration. According to USCIS data, in fiscal year 2020, at
the end of the first Trump Administration, out of the 960,000 em-
ployment authorization applications processed by USCIS that year,
230,000, or roughly one quarter, were employment authorization
applications for asylum applicants.156 By fiscal year 2023, the total
number of work authorization applications increased dramatically
to nearly 2.4 million, of which 800,000 were asylum applicants.157
And in fiscal year 2024, those figures increased to nearly 3.5 mil-
lion total employment authorization applications, with 1.2 million
such applications processed for asylum applicants, quadruple the
number processed just four years prior.158 At the same time,
USCIS also experienced increased flows of renewals for employ-
ment authorization applications for asylum applicants.159 In fiscal
year 2020, 250,000 of the roughly 1 million employment authoriza-
tion application renewal filings were for asylum applicants.160 By
fiscal year 2024, nearly 430,000 of the 1.2 million total employment
authorization renewal filings were for asylum applicants.161
The Biden-Harris Administration implemented a series of regula-
tions providing for longer validity periods and automatic renewals
and extensions of EADs. For instance, on May 4, 2022, USCIS
issued a temporary final rule increasing the automatic renewal

time-period for EADs from 180 days to 540 days.162 The rule was
effective through October 15, 2022, and applied to asylees, asylum
applicants, TPS recipients, TPS applicants, aliens in the U.S. pur-
suant to withholding of removal, applicants for withholding of re-
moval, and aliens who have filed for suspension of deportation,
among others.163
On April 8, 2024, DHS issued another temporary final rule to ac-
complish a similar goal. The same categories of aliens were eligible
for automatic EAD extensions for up to 540 days from their EAD
expiration date.164 This rule, however, sought to bind the new
Trump Administration by not only applying to EAD applicants who
filed their applications on or after October 27, 2023, if the applica-
tion was still pending on April 8, 2024, but also applying to aliens
who filed between April 8, 2024, and September 30, 2025.165
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires USCIS to collect
a $550 fee from asylum applicants who file an application for em-
ployment authorization. CBO preliminarily estimated that this pro-
vision would reduce the deficit by $3.8 billion over the 10-year win-
dow. In addition, the Committee’s proposals require DHS to collect
a $550 fee for asylum applicants seeking to renew or extend em-
ployment authorization. CBO preliminarily estimated that this pro-
vision would reduce the deficit by $17.2 billion.
Fees relating to work authorization application, renewal, and exten-
sion for parolees
In addition to vastly expanding the use of parole, the Biden-Har-
ris Administration’s USCIS worked to expedite the adjudication of
parolees’ work authorization applications. As a result, wait times
for legal immigrants slowed.
USCIS is authorized to collect fees for cost recovery under section
286(m) of the INA.166 The Trump Administration noted in its 2020
fee rule that it was necessary to increase work authorization appli-
cation fees for asylum applicants, for example, to at least $550 to
achieve cost recovery.167 The fee rule was caught up in litigation
for years and ultimately did not go into effect.168
As the Biden-Harris Administration noted, aliens granted parole
‘‘are immediately eligible to apply for employment authoriza-
tion.’’169 Accordingly, the previous Administration’s expansion of
parole led to dramatic increases in the work authorization adju-
dication backlog with respect to parolees. In 2020, USCIS received

and processed new EAD applications for just 9,700 parolees.170 In
2021 and 2022, the number shot up to 71,500 and 100,000, respec-
tively171—and that was before the Biden-Harris Administration
even fully instituted categorical parole programs for nationals of
Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV).
Today, USCIS still operates under the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion’s fee rule. Under the rule, parolees who apply for or seek to
renew or extend work authorization are charged a fee of $470 or
$520, respectively, depending on whether they file electronically or
via paper.172 However, aliens can request a fee waiver. Indeed, the
Biden-Harris Administration worked to expand the approval of fee
waivers and fee reductions, including for employment authorization
applications (Form I–765). In fiscal years 2021 through 2023, the
Biden-Harris Administration estimated it approved 1.4 million fee
waivers, or an estimated $845 million.173 Of those, the Form I–765
employment authorization application was the third-highest form
in terms of the total dollar amount waived.174 Between fiscal years
2021 and 2023, DHS waived nearly $150 million in fees it other-
wise would have collected for employment authorization applica-
tions.175 The Biden-Harris Administration admitted that among
the main factors behind the increases in the amount of fees waived
relating to employment authorization applications during this pe-
riod were the Administration’s categorical parole programs, such as
CHNV.176
USCIS data reflect this reality. Work authorization filings for
aliens paroled into the country increased by more than 10,000 per-
cent during the Biden-Harris Administration.177 In fiscal year
2020, of the 960,000 initial filings for employment authorization,
just 7,000 were filed by parolees.178 By fiscal year 2024, that num-
ber increased dramatically, with total employment authorization
applications rising to 3.4 million, of which 750,000 were for aliens
paroled into the country.179 Renewals for employment authoriza-
tions reflected the same trend. In fiscal year 2020, merely 2,600 of
the roughly 1 million employment authorization application re-
newal filings were for aliens paroled into the country.180 By fiscal
year 2024, of the 1.2 million renewal filings, 43,000 were for aliens
paroled into the country, an increase of more than 1,500 percent.181
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires USCIS to collect
a $550 fee from an alien who has been paroled into the U.S. and
who files an application for employment authorization. In addition,
the Committee’s proposals require DHS to collect a $550 fee for pa-
rolees seeking to renew or extend employment authorization. CBO
preliminarily estimated that the initial employment authorization

Fees relating to work authorization application, renewal, and exten-
sion for aliens granted Temporary Protected Status
Today, under the Biden-Harris Administration’s fee rule, aliens
with TPS who apply for or seek to renew or extend work authoriza-
tion are charged a fee of $470 or $520, respectively, depending on
whether they file electronically or via paper.182 Many aliens re-
quest a fee waiver or reduction, which were expanded by the
Biden-Harris Administration. In fiscal years 2021 through 2023,
the Biden-Harris Administration estimated it approved 1.4 million
fee waivers, leaving an estimated $845 million uncollected.183 Of
those, the Form I–765 employment authorization application was
the third-highest form in terms of the total dollar amount
waived.184 Between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, DHS waived nearly
$150 million in fees it otherwise would have collected for employ-
ment authorization applications.185 The Biden-Harris Administra-
tion admitted that among the biggest drivers of the increases in fee
waivers for employment authorization applications were the ‘‘new
countries, redesignations, and extensions’’ relating to TPS.186
USCIS data demonstrate the impact of the Biden-Harris Admin-
istration’s expansion of TPS on the agency’s workload for work au-
thorization applications. In fiscal year 2020, 251 aliens granted
TPS and 119 aliens who were prima facie eligible for TPS applied
for employment authorization.187 These aliens represented less
than one percent of all initial work authorization filings.188 That
same year, 28,600 aliens granted TPS and 69 aliens prima facie eli-
gible for TPS filed to renew work authorization.189 The following
year, initial filings increased dramatically, with 115,000 aliens
granted TPS—a 45,000 percent increase—and 8,000 prima facie eli-
gible for TPS submitting work authorization applications.190 In fis-
cal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, aliens granted or prima facie eligi-
ble for TPS submitted 66,000, 99,000, and 230,000 initial employ-
ment authorization applications, respectively.191 By fiscal year
2023, work authorization renewal filings had similarly increased.
That year, 227,000 aliens granted TPS, together with 1,400 aliens
prima facie eligible for TPS filed work authorization renewal appli-
cations.192 In fiscal year 2024, 150,000 aliens granted TPS and
11,000 aliens prima facie eligible for TPS submitted work author-
ization renewal applications.193
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires USCIS to collect
a $550 fee for an alien who seeks employment authorization pursu-

ant to a grant of TPS. CBO preliminarily estimated that this provi-
sion would reduce the deficit by $30 million. In addition, the Com-
mittee’s package requires DHS to collect a $550 fee for TPS bene-
ficiaries seeking to renew or extend employment authorization.
CBO preliminarily estimated that this provision would reduce the
deficit by $4.7 billion.
Fee for certain special immigrant juveniles (SIJs) applying for a
green card
Alien minors who (1) have been abused, neglected, or abandoned
by a parent and (2) have been declared a dependent by a state
court may be eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) visa.194
UACs use the SIJ process to receive green cards. The 2008 TVPRA
expanded the SIJ definition to allow a juvenile or other state court
to consider whether reunification is possible with ‘‘one or both’’ of
the child’s parents.195 This language allows a minor to receive an
SIJ visa even if only one of his or her two parents has abused or
abandoned them, and even if the minor can still be safely reunited
with their other parent.
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires an alien who
files an application for SIJ status to pay a $500 fee if reunification
with one parent is possible despite abuse, abandonment, neglect, or
other similar activity by the other parent. CBO preliminarily esti-
mated that the fee would reduce the deficit by $18 million over the
10-year window.
Fees for unaccompanied alien child (UAC) sponsors
Each year, Congress appropriates billions of dollars to fund the
UAC program. While in HHS custody, UACs receive food, edu-
cation, medical services, clothing, and other services costly to U.S.
taxpayers.196 For example, in fiscal year 2021, when roughly
122,000 UAC were transferred to the care of ORR, obligations for
the UAC program were roughly $7 billion, or roughly $57,000 per
UAC.197 Under the Biden-Harris Administration, UACs were then
released as quickly as possible to a sponsor, often without nec-
essary safeguards. According to an internal ORR memo, the Biden-
Harris Administration released UACs to sponsors who provided im-
ages that were ‘‘obviously fake or doctored.’’198 For example:
[In one] photo, submitted by a man who wanted custody
of a migrant child, showed the child’s mother crudely
photoshopped into the image to claim he had a relation-
ship with her. The mother’s feet were clipped off in the
botched clip-art job. Another incident had a 23-year-old mi-
grant who claimed he was a minor being held in a federal
1948 U.S.C. §1101(a)(27)(J).

reportedly asking kids ‘‘You want to have sex?’’199
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires the sponsor of a
UAC to pay a $3,500 fee prior to the release of the UAC to the
sponsor. The fee will partially reimburse the government for the
cost of processing, housing, feeding, educating, transporting, and
otherwise caring for the UAC from the time the UAC entered U.S.
government custody to the time at which the sponsor takes custody
of the UAC. A portion of the fee will be directed back to the agency
to fund background checks on potential UAC sponsors and all adult
residents of the potential UAC sponsor’s household. CBO prelimi-
narily estimated that the fee would reduce the deficit by $350 mil-
lion over the 10-year window.
Visa integrity fee
Foreign visitors to the United States must either obtain a non-
immigrant visa to legally visit the United States temporarily or, if
they are a resident of one of the 40 Visa Waiver Program (VWP)
countries, be authorized to travel to the U.S. through the Electronic
System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) for no more than 90
days.200 The United States welcomes tens of millions of foreign na-
tionals with nonimmigrant visas to the United States legally each
year.201
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires the Secretary of
State to impose a $250 fee on each alien issued a nonimmigrant
visa by the State Department. This section provides that aliens
may be reimbursed after the visa validity period expires if the alien
can demonstrate compliance with certain conditions. First, if the
alien demonstrates that the alien did not seek admission to the
U.S., and therefore did not utilize the visa, the alien can receive
reimbursement. Second, if the alien demonstrates that, after ad-
mission to the U.S., he or she complied with all terms of the visa
and departed the U.S. within five days of the date on which the
alien was authorized to remain in the U.S., the alien is eligible for
reimbursement. Third, if the alien demonstrates he or she filed to
extend, change, or adjust such status, the alien is eligible for reim-
bursement. According to a preliminary estimate from CBO, this fee
would reduce the deficit by an estimated $28.9 billion over the 10-
year window.
Form I–94 fee
CBP uses the Form I–94 to track arrival and departure record
information for most aliens traveling to the U.S., as part of the
agency’s entry-exit system.202 The Committee’s reconciliation pack-
age creates a $24 fee for Form I–94. This fee is in addition to the
current $6 fee, thus in total per Form I–94 the cost will now be

$30. According to the agency, an increase in the fee is needed to
achieve cost recovery.203 While most of the increased fee will be al-
located to the agency for cost recovery, a portion of the funds raised
will be allocated to the Treasury for deficit reduction. CBO prelimi-
narily estimated this fee would reduce the deficit by $10.8 billion
over the 10-year window.
Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) fee
The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act
of 2007 established an electronic authorization system to pre-screen
aliens prior to arrival in the United States.204 The Electronic Sys-
tem for Travel Authorization (ESTA) operationalizes the require-
ment for all Visa Waiver Program (VWP) travelers to obtain au-
thorization prior to travel.205 As part of an ESTA application,
aliens are currently required to pay a $21 fee.206
A portion of the funds raised by this fee is credited to the agency
for cost recovery.207 However, currently, the amount credited to
CBP is insufficient to cover such costs.208 Additionally, a portion of
the funds raised by ESTA fees are credited to a separate account
known as the Travel Promotion Fund, which funds the Corporation
for Travel Promotion, a non-profit corporation established to pro-
mote tourism and travel to the U.S., also known as Brand USA.209
Up to $100 million derived from the collection of a portion of the
ESTA fee becomes available to Brand USA. The first Trump Ad-
ministration proposed to zero out the Brand USA account in 2017
and ‘‘redirect the . . . surcharge . . . to support U.S. Customs and
Border Protection passenger inspection activities.210
The Committee’s reconciliation package increases the ESTA fee,
paid by all foreign nationals seeking to enter the U.S. via VWP,
from $21 to $40. The Committee’s proposals allocate an increased
portion of the funds raised to the agency for cost recovery, $10 per
authorization. At least $13 per authorization is also allocated to the
Treasury for deficit reduction. In addition, the amount that can be
transferred to Brand USA is capped each year, and the remainder
of the funds raised under that subsection in excess of the cap will
be allocated to deficit reduction.
Immigration user fee
The immigration user air and sea passenger processing fee was
established in 1986 at $5 and is currently set at $7 per pas-
senger.211 The fee applies to aliens arriving in the United States

most foreign locations on a commercial sea vessel.212
The Committee’s reconciliation package increases the immigra-
tion user fee by $3 for all passengers and eliminates a partial fee
exemption for commercial sea passengers arriving from the United
States, Canada, Mexico, or adjacent islands. These two adjust-
ments will result in a total fee of $10 for all passengers, regardless
of mode of transportation or point of departure. This fee was last
adjusted in 2003, yet international travel volumes continue to grow
at an annual rate of between 3 and 4 percent, and, according to the
CBP, agency costs for immigration inspections continue to in-
crease.213 Nine dollars per fee imposed will be allocated to the
agency for cost recovery, while one dollar per fee imposed will be
allocated to the Treasury for deficit reduction. CBO preliminarily
estimated that this fee will reduce the deficit by $1.4 billion over
the 10-year window.
Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS) fee
When an alien applies for a nonimmigrant visa to travel to the
United States, the validity period of the visa depends in large part
on the type of visa and reciprocal arrangements between the
United States and the country that issued the alien’s passport.214
Some visas may be issued with validity periods of up to 10
years.215 While longer length visa validity periods may provide con-
venience to foreign travelers, they limit the U.S. Government’s abil-
ity to receive regular updated biographic or other pertinent infor-
mation from repeat visitors who travel to the United States mul-
tiple times over the life-span of a visa.216 These concerns are of
particular importance in the case of Chinese nationals.
Given these concerns, DHS and the State Department developed
the Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS), which provides a
mechanism through which information updates can be obtained
from aliens holding a U.S. nonimmigrant visa of a designated cat-
egory in a passport issued by an identified country.217 By requiring
enrollment in EVUS for periodic updates to biographic and travel
information, CBP can increase the chances of identifying individ-
uals who may pose a threat to the United States.218 In general,
EVUS is used for travelers from China with 10-year, multiple entry
B1, B2, or B1/B2 visas for tourism and business.219 EVUS requires
travelers with these visas to provide updated biographic and travel
information to CBP via a publicly-accessible website prior to initial
travel on the visa and then at least every two years from the date
of visa issuance for the duration of visa validity.220

The Committee’s reconciliation package imposes an EVUS fee of
$30. While most of the funds are allocated to the agency for cost
recovery, a portion of the funds raised are allocated to the Treasury
for deficit reduction. CBO preliminarily estimated that this fee will
reduce the deficit by $49 million over the 10-year window.
Continuance fee
Under federal regulations, immigration judges ‘‘may grant a mo-
tion for continuance for good cause shown.’’221 A continuance is a
‘‘temporary adjournment[] of case proceedings until a different day
or time.’’222
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires a $100 fee for
every continuance that (1) is requested by an alien; (2) is granted
by an immigration judge; and (3) is not based on ‘‘exceptional cir-
cumstances.’’ Current immigration law defines ‘‘exceptional cir-
cumstances’’ as ‘‘exceptional circumstances (such as battery or ex-
treme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, seri-
ous illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse,
child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling cir-
cumstances) beyond the control of the alien.’’223 With a required
fee for continuances, immigration courts could recoup some of the
resources lost because of continuances.
Additional fees in immigration court
EOIR adjudicates applications for immigration relief before and
appeals from immigration judge decisions. Although asylum appli-
cations are the most common applications filed at immigration
courts, aliens can seek other forms of immigration relief before an
immigration judge. In fact, immigration judges and the BIA may
adjudicate numerous applications and waivers, including:
• Applications for cancellation of removal for certain permanent
residents;224
• Applications for cancellation of removal and adjustment of sta-
tus for certain nonpermanent residents;225

224Under the cancellation of removal statute, an immigration judge may cancel the removal
of an alien who is otherwise inadmissible or removable from the country if the alien establishes
that he ‘‘(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5
years, (2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted
in any status, and (3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.’’ 8 U.S.C. §1229b(a).

of, and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,’’ of an alien
who is otherwise inadmissible or removal from the country if the alien establishes that he ‘‘(A)
has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10
year immediately preceding the date of such application; (B) has been a person of good moral
character during such period; (C) has not been convicted’’ of certain crimes, and ‘‘(D) establishes
that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien’s spouse,
parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for perma-
nent residence.’’ 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b).

The BIA has jurisdiction over appeals of immigration judges’ de-
cisions.232 As the nation’s immigration courts have been saddled
with a historic number of cases, the BIA’s caseload has also in-
creased. In 2000, for example, the BIA received 30,049 total ap-
226Aliens who were admitted or paroled into the United States may adjust their immigration
status to that of a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) if (1) the alien ‘‘is eligible to
receive an immigrant visa,’’ (2) the alien ‘‘is admissible to the United States for permanent resi-
dence,’’ and (3) ‘‘an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application
is filed.’’ 8 U.S.C. §1255(a). Aliens who are physically present in the United States but who en-
tered without inspection (i.e. without being admitted or paroled) may also adjust their immigra-
tion status to that of a lawful permanent resident under additional requirements. See 8 U.S.C.
§1255(i). Federal regulations give immigration judges ‘‘exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any
application for adjustment of status’’ filed by an alien in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R.
1245.2(a)(1)(i).
227Certain aliens who are inadmissible to the United States and ineligible for various forms
of immigration relief may seek a waiver of certain grounds of inadmissibility. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.
§1182(a)(9)(B)(v), (C) (unlawful presence waivers); 8 U.S.C. §1182(g) (waiver of health-related
grounds); 8 U.S.C. §1182(h) (waiver of certain criminal grounds); 8 U.S.C. §1182(i) (waiver of
fraud and misrepresentation ground).
228TPS may be granted to eligible aliens from countries that have been designated by the
DHS Secretary due to ‘‘an ongoing armed conflict within the state’’ or ‘‘an earthquake, flood,
drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but
temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected.’’ 8 U.S.C. §1254a. See generally
H. Comm. on the Judiciary, Interim Staff Rep., De Facto Mass Amnesty: How the Biden-Harris
Admin. Abused Temporary Protected Status to Shield Hundreds of Thousands of Illegal Aliens
from Deportation (Mar. 3, 2025).
229An alien may be eligible for suspension of deportation, a type of immigration relief that
was replaced by cancellation of removal, if the alien establishes that (1) he ‘‘has been physically
present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 7 years immediately pre-
ceding the date the application was filed; (2) he ‘‘was and is a person of good moral character’’;
and (3) his removal from the United States would ‘‘result in extreme hardship to the alien or
to the alien’s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully
admitted for permanent residence.’’ 8 C.F.R. §240.65(b). The relevant statute was repealed in
1996, but certain aliens remain eligible for suspension of deportation. See Suspension of Depor-
tation, LEGAL INFO. INSTITUTE, CORNELL LAW SCHOOL, https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/

230An adjudicating official or the BIA may impose disciplinary sanctions against a practitioner
if he engages in fraudulent or unethical activity, such as charging excessive fees, knowingly
making a false statement relating to an immigration case, being disbarred or suspended, or com-
mitting a serious crime. See 8 C.F.R. §1003.102. An attorney or organization may appeal a deci-
sion of the adjudicating official to the BIA within 30 days of the official’s decision. See Exec.

231Aliens applying for immigration benefits from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS) can appeal a USCIS denial of certain applications to the BIA. See generally EOIR–29,

ZENSHIP AND IMMIGR. SERVS., https://www.uscis.gov/eoir-29 (last accessed Mar. 6, 2025). These
applications are (1) petitions for alien relative and (2) petitions for certain widowers, special im-
migrants, and other aliens. See generally I–360, Petition for Amerasion, Widow(er), or Special

peals.233 By fiscal year 2019, the number of case appeals filed with
the BIA swelled to 63,235.234 In fiscal years 2023 and 2024, there
were 50,855 and 50,416 total appeals filed, respectively.235 Mean-
while, the number of pending appeals has risen dramatically, from
less than 17,000 pending appeals at the end of fiscal year 2015 to
roughly 130,000 pending appeals by the end of December 2024—
a nearly 650 percent increase.236
In addition to adjudicating applications and appeals, immigration
courts and the BIA receive thousands of motions to reopen and mo-
tions to reconsider each year, only compounding their increasing
backlogs. Through a motion to reopen, an alien requests that an
immigration judge or the BIA reopen the alien’s case to ‘‘consider
new facts or evidence in the case.’’237 A motion to reconsider, by
contrast, ‘‘either identifies an error in law or fact’’ in the immigra-
tion judge’s or BIA’s prior decision ‘‘or identifies a change in law’’
that affects the adjudicator’s decision.238
The number of motions to reopen filed with immigration courts
rose dramatically over the last four years. In addition to overbur-
dening the immigration courts with a flood of new cases, the Biden-
Harris Administration worked to undo immigration judges’ pre-
vious decisions by encouraging ICE attorneys to join motions to re-
open cases. A Biden-era memo outlined how ICE attorneys could
join aliens’ motions to reopen their cases so that ICE could then
agree to dismiss the case altogether.239 Aliens and ICE attorneys
took note. In fiscal year 2024, 44,094 motions to reopen were filed
with the immigration courts, compared to an average of 17,920 mo-
tions to reopen during the Trump Administration—a 146 percent
increase.240 In fiscal year 2024, immigration courts also received
roughly 2,100 motions to reconsider, with more than 7,000 total
motions filed with the BIA.241
Despite its historic case backlog, EOIR charges fees for only a
fraction of the applications it receives—and even then, the fees
have not been updated in four decades and are far from covering
the cost of adjudication. EOIR last updated its fees in 1986.242 The
Trump Administration attempted to raise the fee amounts,243 but

federal district court judges stopped the implementation of the fees
in January 2021 and March 2021.244 Through new statutory fees
for commonly adjudicated applications and frequently filed motions,
EOIR could partially defray its adjudication costs, fund additional
immigration judges and support staff, and invest in infrastructure
and technology upgrades to more efficiently adjudicate cases.
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires fees for applica-
tions, motions, and appeals filed with or adjudicated by EOIR:
• Fee for filing an application for cancellation of removal for cer-
tain permanent residents (current filing fee is $100);245
• Fee for filing an application for cancellation of removal and ad-
justment of status for certain nonpermanent residents (current fil-
ing fee is $100);246
• Fee for filing an application for adjustment of status (current
filing fee is $1,440);247
• Fee for filing an application for waiver of grounds of inadmis-
sibility (current filing fee is $1,050);248
• Fee for filing an application for temporary protected status
(current filing fee is $50);249
• Fee for filing an application for suspension of deportation (cur-
rent filing fee is $100);250
• Fee for filing an appeal from a decision of an immigration
judge (current filing fee is $110);251
• Fee for filing an appeal from a decision of a DHS officer (cur-
rent filing fee is $110);252
• Fee for filing an appeal from a decision of an adjudicating offi-
cial in a practitioner disciplinary case (current filing fee is
$675);253 and
• Fee for filing a motion to reopen or motion to reconsider (cur-
rent filing fee is at least $110 for a motion to reopen or reconsider
before the BIA and at least $145 for a motion to reopen or recon-
sider before an immigration judge).254

removed in absentia if the aliens fail to attend an immigration
court hearing.255
The number of in absentia removal orders rose dramatically just
as the Biden-Harris Administration released more illegal aliens
into the United States. In fiscal year 2023, there were 159,379 in
absentia removal orders for aliens who failed to appear before an
immigration judge, a 74 percent increase from the second-highest
total of 91,271 such orders since 2008.256 That is an average of
13,282 in absentia removal orders each month.257 For asylum ap-
plicants, the number of in absentia removal orders in fiscal year
2023 reached 13,732, the highest total since at least 2008.258 In
cases that originated with an alien claiming a credible fear of per-
secution when encountered at the border, the in absentia removal
order numbers climbed to their second-highest total since at least
fiscal year 2008, with 9,988 in absentia removal orders in those
cases in fiscal year 2023 alone.259 By the end of fiscal year 2024,
immigration judges ordered 222,687 aliens removed after they
failed to attend their immigration court hearings.260 In absentia
cases waste the immigration courts’ funding resources.
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires fees in certain
instances when aliens are ordered removed in absentia. The pack-
age requires the sponsor of an unaccompanied alien child to pay a
$5,000 fee prior to the release of such unaccompanied alien child
to a sponsor to ensure the UAC’s appearance in immigration court.
The sponsor may receive reimbursement for the fee if the sponsor
demonstrates that (1) the UAC was not ordered removed in
absentia or (2) the in absentia order was rescinded. The package
also requires a $5,000 fee for any alien who (1) is ordered removed
in absentia after failing to appear at an immigration court hearing
and (2) is subsequently arrested by ICE. This section includes an
exception for cases in which an in absentia order is rescinded.
Diversity visa program fees
Every year for decades, the United States has issued tens of
thousands of immigrant visas to aliens around the world who are
selected through a lottery.261 The diversity visa program, which
provides aliens a pathway to citizenship in the U.S., was enacted
‘‘to foster legal immigration from countries other than the major
sending countries of current immigrants to the United States.’’262
To determine which countries’ nationals are eligible for the diver-
sity visa lottery each year, the program uses a statutory formula
255INA §240(b)(5)(A).

to calculate regions with high admissions and low admissions of
aliens into the United States.263 Aliens from high-admission re-
gions are ineligible for a diversity visa, with 50,000 diversity visas
distributed to nationals from low-admission regions.264 During a
registration period each year, aliens can enter the diversity visa
lottery through the Electronic Diversity Visa website.265 There is
no cost to enter the lottery, and the eligibility criteria are low,
merely requiring ‘‘at least a high school education or the equiva-
lent, or two years of experience in an occupation that requires at
least two years of training or experience.’’266 Through a lottery sys-
tem, ‘‘approximately 100,000 selectees are randomly chosen’’ and
identified as ‘‘those who are eligible to apply’’ for a diversity
visa.267 Once selected, aliens must confirm their qualifications,
submit a visa application, prepare documentation, undergo an
interview, and pay relevant fees.268 The State Department then
issues roughly 50,000 diversity visas to qualified applicants.269 The
visas are ‘‘apportioned among six geographic regions with a max-
imum of seven percent available to persons born in any single
country.’’270
Millions of people around the world register for the diversity visa
lottery every year. In 2019, 14.3 million aliens entered the diversity
visa lottery, with more than 8 million derivatives (spouses and chil-
dren); in 2020, there were 14.7 million entrants, with 8.4 million
derivatives; and in 2021, there were 6.7 million entrants and 5 mil-
lion derivatives.271 In fiscal year 2019, 453,242 Iranian nationals
registered for a chance at this pathway to citizenship in the United
States, with 1.8 million registrations from Uzbekistan, 240,323
from Russia, 141,679 from Yemen, 28,542 from Somalia, 35,939
from Afghanistan, and 47,368 from Iraq.272
The Committee’s reconciliation package requires a $250 fee for
each alien who registers for the diversity visa program. The Com-
mittee’s proposal also requires a $400 diversity visa application fee
for any alien who is selected for the program.273 More than 20
years ago, the OIG warned that the diversity visa program’s costs
‘‘significantly exceed revenues,’’ with embassies lacking sufficient
resources ‘‘to develop, investigate, and process all [diversity visa]

that the State Department ‘‘request authority to collect processing
fees from all persons who apply for the diversity visa program.’’275
This proposal accomplishes those goals. CBO preliminarily esti-
mated that the diversity visa application fee would reduce the def-
icit by $185 million over the 10-year window, with the initial reg-
istration fee reducing the deficit by $2 billion.
REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS
Congressional review of agency rulemaking
The Constitution separates the powers of the federal government
by vesting the legislative power in Congress, the executive power
in the President, and the judicial power in the courts.276 The
‘‘[s]tructural separation between the exercise of federal executive,
legislative, and judicial power preserves individual freedom’’ and
‘‘helps to ensure that each branch can more effectively perform its
function of serving as a check on the other branches.’’277 This care-
ful system of ‘‘[c]hecks and balances ha[s] a role in ensuring a more
meaningful separation of powers for they help[] ensure that no one
branch w[ill] dominate’’ our federal government.278
Consolidating these separate powers departs from constitutional
principles and jeopardizes American liberty.279 Yet, the administra-
tive state does just that: federal agencies exercise legislative power
by issuing regulations with the force of law, executive power by en-
forcing those regulations, and judicial power by adjudicating dis-
putes about them.280
Given the administrative state’s unconstitutional assumption of
legislative powers and its lack of electoral accountability to the
American people, it is unsurprising that it has imposed unpopular
and radical regulations. The Biden-Harris Administration routinely
sought ‘‘to accomplish through regulation what [it could not] pass
through Congress.’’281 Federal agencies, with limited political ac-
countability and freedom from the lawmaking procedures that the
Constitution requires of Congress, often try to implement far-left
policy goals that could not be attained through the legislative proc-
ess. Hundreds of examples of this overreach can be found through-
out the administrative state.282

The Administrative Procedure Act
Originally enacted by Congress in 1946, the Administrative Pro-
cedure Act (APA) provides standards for agency rulemaking, among
other things.283 Under ‘‘formal’’ rulemaking, an agency may issue
a ‘‘rule after the kind of trial-type hearing procedures normally re-
served for adjudicatory orders.’’284 More commonly, agencies issue
rules through ‘‘informal’’ or notice-and-comment rulemaking.285 In-
formal rulemaking requires publication of a ‘‘notice of proposed
rulemaking in the Federal Register,’’ an opportunity for public feed-
back (typically through the submission of written comments), and
publication of the final rule at least thirty days before its effective
date.286 Such legislative rules have the ‘‘force and effect of law.’’287
Between 1984 and 2024, agencies were given wide judicial lati-
tude when determining the meaning of their own statute for the
purposes of promulgating rules. In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled
in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc.
that judges were required to defer to an agency’s interpretation of
its own ambiguous statute so long as such legal determination was
‘‘reasonable.’’288 Despite being relatively innocuous in the begin-
ning,289 the holding in Chevron quickly allowed agencies to expand
their power by finding new authorities in old statutes.290 By ex-
ploiting ambiguities in the law, the administrative state effectively
coopted legislative authority from Congress in the form of increased
rulemaking.291
In 2024, the Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v.
Raimondo ended the required judicial deference imposed by Chev-
ron.292 In Loper Bright, the Court held that under the APA, courts
are required to express independent judgement when determining
whether an agency acted within the boundaries of its statutory au-
thority.293 While courts may look to an agency’s interpretation of
its own statute in reaching its independent conclusion, the Court
held that the APA prohibits courts from deferring to agency inter-
pretation without conducting its own analysis.
The Congressional Review Act
In addition to the APA, another existing law governing—and de-
signed to constrain—agency action is the Congressional Review Act
(CRA) of 1996,294 which was part of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich’s
Contract With America legislative agenda.295 The CRA requires
agencies to submit rules to Congress and the U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) before they can take effect, and it creates

an expedited process, which cannot be filibustered, for Congress to
disapprove a rule by passing a joint resolution.296 Once both the
House and Senate pass a joint resolution disapproving of the rule,
and the President signs such resolution into law, the rule will no
longer be in effect.297 The CRA provides Congress with a fast-track
process to prevent agency rulemaking that satisfies the Constitu-
tion’s bicameralism and presentment requirements.298
Under the CRA, ‘‘[m]ajor rules’’—those causing ‘‘an annual effect
on the economy of $100,000,000 or more,’’ ‘‘a major increase in costs
or prices,’’ or other ‘‘significant adverse effects’’ on the economy—
are subject to additional restrictions under the CRA.299 In par-
ticular, major rules cannot take effect until at least ‘‘60 days after
the date that the rule is published in the Federal Register,’’ double
the thirty-day delay period provided under the APA, giving ‘‘Con-
gress additional time to consider whether to overturn a major rule
. . . before it goes into effect.’’300
Congress’s power to disapprove agency rules under the CRA pro-
vides a check on federal administrative power. Currently, however,
the CRA requires Congress to introduce separate joint resolutions
for each agency rule it seeks to disapprove.301 By forcing Congress
to consider agency rules one at a time, the CRA slows Congress’s
ability to provide oversight of agency action. This inefficiency is es-
pecially pronounced in the final year of a President’s term. In so-
called ‘‘midnight rulemaking,’’ executive agencies historically issue
substantially more regulations in the President’s final year of his
term.302 During the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations,
agencies issued approximately 2.5 times more regulations during
the last year of each President’s term.303
Despite the CRA’s initial promise to help reestablish Congress’s
proper role in making federal policy, as of July 2024, only twenty
agency rules had been overturned under the CRA—because the
House, Senate, and President must all be aligned with regard to
the disapproval resolution, the CRA is realistically only an effective
check on regulations promulgated during the waning days of a
presidential administration.304 On average, Congress has dis-
approved of less than one agency regulation per year since the pas-
sage of the CRA, but during that time, federal agencies issued
more than 100,000 rules—thus, Congress has rejected just 0.02
percent of the rules issued by agencies.305

agency compliance with rulemaking requirements. The Commit-
tee’s proposal would also require that Congress affirmatively ap-
prove of major rules that increase revenue prior to them taking ef-
fect.
Congressional Review Act compliance
In general, agencies are required to quantify the costs and bene-
fits that their regulations will impose on regulated entities.306
Since 1993, Executive Order 12866 has been in effect, and along
with requiring a cost-benefit analysis of all regulations, the order
‘‘encourages agencies to design their regulations in the most cost-
effective manner to achieve the regulatory objective and to ensure
that the benefits of a regulation justify the costs.’’307 For economi-
cally significant rules, defined as imposing an annual effect on the
economy of at least $200 million—raised from $100 million in
2023—agencies must quantify the costs and benefits of the regula-
tion and reasonably feasible alternatives to such regulation.308
Often, the agency’s analysis is either incorrect or incomplete. For
example, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that its newly
promulgated Premerger Notification Rule would increase the cost
of preparing a merger filing by around $49,000.309 However, some
independent estimates have placed the increase in cost at over
$300,000—over six times more than the agency’s estimate.310 Addi-
tionally, while the FTC only considered, albeit incorrectly, the di-
rect costs of the regulation, the indirect costs associated with the
regulation are likely far more significant.311 The decrease in merg-
er activity related to the rule will likely disrupt innovation and en-
trepreneurial activity and disrupt economic activity across the na-
tion.312
While not the case for the FTC’s Premerger Notification Rule,
some agencies are able to avoid the ‘‘major rule’’ designation under
the CRA by underestimating the cost of their regulations. For ex-
ample, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS)
Electronic Identification Eartag Rule is estimated to impose only
$26 million in economic costs annually,313 less than the $100 mil-
lion threshold required by the CRA to be designated as a major
rule.314 However, to fully establish an electronic database for live-
stock, as is the stated goal of the regulation, the economic cost is
estimated to be over $550 million in the first year alone.315 Taking
these estimates as given, there are around $525 million in indirect
costs associated with APHIS’s regulation.

While agencies generally initiate any economic analysis during
the rulemaking process, it is the responsibility of the Office of In-
formation and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to ensure that the agency
is not cutting corners.316 An important function of OIRA is to con-
duct oversight of the analysis conducted by agencies,317 and while
some claim that OIRA simply applies a ‘‘rubber stamp’’ to agency
analysis,318 there is some evidence to suggest that OIRA review
makes a meaningful difference in the cost estimates produced by
agencies.319
Despite the impact that OIRA may have in reviewing agency cost
estimates, OIRA is not required to conduct its own analysis to inde-
pendently verify the precision of an agency’s estimate.320 OIRA re-
view consists of checking that the agency’s calculations, methodolo-
gies, and assumptions are correct, but OIRA does not conduct its
own analysis.321
Such de novo independent analysis by OIRA may include a com-
plete reworking of the methodology, assumptions, and recollection
of any data, but such comprehensive analysis would likely be un-
necessary. In conducting de novo analysis, OIRA may review and
accept an agency’s assumptions and methodologies, with proper
analysis detailing why the agency’s assumptions and methodologies
are correct, but it should not give the agency deference or rubber
stamp the agency’s work.
Such an analysis would be particularly impactful given the tend-
ency of agencies to incorrectly estimate the cost of regulations.322
While there is evidence that agencies both over- and under-esti-
mate the costs associated with their regulatory schemes,323 OIRA
rarely intervenes to require the agency to conduct more rigorous
analysis.324 OIRA has the power to ‘‘return’’ regulations back to an
agency for analytical deficiencies, but estimates reveal that less
than one percent of regulations are returned.325 If OIRA conducted
its own de novo analysis, it may be in a better position to identify
the flaws in an agency’s analysis and propose enhanced methodolo-
gies and more accurate assumptions for more rigorous analysis in
the future.
The Committee’s reconciliation package provides funding to OMB
to enhance its capacity to analyze the direct and reasonably fore-
seeable indirect costs of compliance with certain regulations and
estimate the budgetary effects of enforcement of certain regulations

to better ensure agency compliance with applicable rulemaking re-
quirements.
Limitation on donations made pursuant to settlement agreements to
which the United States is a party
Popularized during the Obama Administration, the use of settle-
ment slush funds is a litigation technique in which funds that
should be directed to injured parties or deposited in the United
States Treasury are diverted to politically-favored third-party enti-
ties or programs that the executive branch supports, all while
avoiding Congressional oversight.326 In these cases, as part of a
settlement, defendants are required to make payments to favored
or politically-friendly third parties.327 Because these payments are
from a defendant to a third-party, and the money does not flow
through the Treasury, it can be challenging to track these settle-
ments and the funds involved.328 Many of these settlements also
involve non-disclosure requirements, and therefore, other than pub-
lic statements that may inform the defendant’s shareholders of the
settlement amount, there is little transparency into which entities
receive the funds under the settlement.329 Such settlements effec-
tively seize a portion of Congress’s power over the purse and put
it into the hands of agencies, as the executive branch, not Con-
gress, is determining the terms of these settlements.
An example of how settlement slush funds work in practice can
be seen with President Obama’s unsuccessful request in 2011 that
Congress fund electric vehicle innovation.330 After Congress did not
act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reached a partial
settlement with Volkswagen in a lawsuit related to pollution
claims.331 The settlement required Volkswagen to invest $2.7 bil-
lion in ‘‘projects across the country’’ to reduce emissions, with bil-
lions of dollars directed toward ‘‘improving infrastructure, access
and education to support and advance zero emissions vehicles.’’332
This settlement circumvented Congressional spending authority
and was a form of unconstitutional overreach by the executive
branch.333 The Obama Administration also used settlements to di-
rect funds to groups such as the National Fish and Wildlife Foun-
dation, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, the Na-
tional Urban League, and the National Council of La Raza, among
others.334

Unlike with federal outlays to third parties where Congress has
authorized an agency to exercise discretion in directing funds,
there are few requirements as to how settlement funds must be
spent and accounted for.335 For example, government contracting
laws require clear disclosure and accounting of how the third par-
ties spend funds allocated through normal government channels.336
In contrast, settlement slush funds are not subject to such laws
and enable the executive branch to apply pressure to defendants
and direct funds without the same oversight that would apply in
other contexts.337 Accordingly, the details of where third-party pay-
ments go are often unknown. For example, one study found that
only 1.4 percent of all settlement slush fund payments could be
tracked—the remaining 98.6 percent of the $668 million were di-
rected in ways that were undisclosed.338
The Trump Administration essentially ended the practice of
using settlement slush funds.339 In 2017, then-Attorney General
Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum prohibiting Department of
Justice (DOJ) staff from entering into these types of agreements
except in limited circumstances.340 In 2020, the Trump Administra-
tion further limited the use of these agreements.341 Specifically, the
Trump DOJ expressly prohibited its attorneys from negotiating set-
tlements in environmental cases that directed funding to third par-
ties, and instead directed settlement funds to be placed in the U.S.
Treasury.342
However, in 2022, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland re-
scinded the Trump Administration policies that banned third-party
payments.343 In support of the rescission, then-Attorney General
Garland noted that third-party payments have certain remedial
purposes and should be permissible if they have a ‘‘strong connec-
tion to the underlying violation or violations of federal law at issue
in the enforcement action.’’344 However, as one commentator wrote,
the concept of a ‘‘remedial’’ settlement agreement is an oxymoron:
the courts already provide a legitimate avenue for remedial dam-
ages.345 Left unabated and subject to administrative discretion,
this practice can result in abuse.346

Solicitation of orders defined
In general, the Interstate Income Act of 1959 exempts businesses
whose only economic nexus in the state is the ‘‘solicitation of or-
ders’’ that are subsequently fulfilled from a point outside of the
state from state income tax obligation.347 The original intent of this
law was to clarify the status of state taxation of interstate com-
merce following a pair of Supreme Court decisions in 1959.348 The
Court held that states are permitted to impose taxes on income
that foreign businesses generate within the state.349 Those deci-
sions left open the question of whether states could impose taxes
on out-of-state businesses whose income is solicited within the
state, but otherwise do not have a physical presence in that
state.350 The Interstate Income Act of 1959 was passed to ensure
that businesses that only solicit orders within a state, but do not
have offices, warehouses, or any other physical presence in the
state, are exempt from that state’s income tax regimes.351
In 1992, the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of business ac-
tivities that fall under this tax exemption in Wisconsin Department
of Revenue v. William Wrigley Jr., Co.352 In Wrigley, the Court held
that the only protected business activities are those with ‘‘no inde-
pendent business function apart from their connection to soliciting
orders.’’353 The Court also articulated a narrow exception from tax
liability for activities that occur out-of-state and are not ancillary
to the solicitation of orders but otherwise provide the businesses
with a de minimis value.354
In 2024, the Minnesota Supreme Court seized on the Wrigley de-
cision to find that the gathering and reporting of competitor infor-
mation and market conditions, despite being obtained in the proc-
ess of soliciting orders, does provide the company with more than
de minimis value and the company is therefore liable for tax on the
income generated in that state.355 The Minnesota Supreme Court
held that making such reporting activity a component of the sales
process does not necessarily mean that it is required for the solici-
tation of sales.356 The Minnesota Supreme Court found that the
gathering and reporting of information was an exercise in market
research, and simply assigning such market research to sales per-
sonnel does convert such activity into solicitation.357

In effect, both the United States and Minnesota Supreme Courts
have narrowed the scope of the solicitation exemption to state in-
come tax to the point where the exemption is largely ineffective.358
Nealy all activity that a business engages in other than the literal
solicitation of orders is subject to state income taxes.359 Further,
the Multistate Tax Commission (MTC), a multi-state, intergovern-
mental tax agency that sets uniform tax policies which its member
states agree to follow,360 has compiled a list of numerous, routine
business steps that companies engage in during the solicitation and
fulfilment of orders but that the MTC has determined do not qual-
ify as exempt under the law.361 According to the MTC, activities
such as offering post-sale customer service, offering extended war-
ranty plans through its website, or contracting with a third party
fulfilment company with fulfillment centers in a given state may
cause a business to lose its tax-exempt status.362
The Committee’s reconciliation package clarifies the tax treat-
ment of certain interstate commercial activity regarding the solici-
tation of orders.

partment of Homeland Security. This section requires a fee of $900
for any alien who files an appeal from a decision of an officer of
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The section directs
no more than 25 percent of the fees received to EOIR and the re-
maining fees to the Treasury for deficit reduction.
(f) Fee for filing an appeal from a decision of an adjudicating offi-
cial in a practitioner disciplinary case. This section requires a fee
of $1,325 for any practitioner who files an appeal from a decision
of an adjudicating official in a practitioner disciplinary case. The
section directs no more than 25 percent of the fees received to
EOIR and the remaining fees to the Treasury for deficit reduction.
(g) Fee for filing a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider.
This section requires a fee of $900 on any alien who files a motion
to reopen or motion to reconsider a decision of an immigration
judge or the BIA. The section clarifies that such a fee does not
apply to motions to reopen a removal order entered in absentia if
the motion is based on the alien (1) failing to receive proper notice
of the proceeding or (2) failing to attend the proceeding because the
alien was in state or federal custody and the failure to appear was
through no fault of the alien. The section directs no more than 25
percent of the fees received to EOIR and the remaining fees to the
Treasury for deficit reduction.
(h) Fee for filing an application for suspension of deportation.
This section requires a fee of $600 for any alien who files with an
immigration court an application for suspension of deportation. The
section directs no more than 25 percent of the fees received to

any alien who files an application for cancellation of removal for
certain permanent residents. The section directs no more than 25
percent of the fees received to EOIR and the remaining fees to the
Treasury for deficit reduction.
(j) Fee for filing an application for cancellation of removal and
adjustment of status for certain nonpermanent residents. This sec-
tion requires a fee of $1,500 for any alien who files an application
for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status for certain
nonpermanent residents. The section directs no more than 25 per-
cent of the fees received to EOIR and the remaining fees to the
Treasury for deficit reduction.
Sec. 70017. ESTA fee. This section increases the fee for the Elec-
tronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which is required
to be used by aliens who travel to the U.S. via the Visa Waiver
Program, from $21 to $40. Currently, $4 of the fee goes to the
agency for cost recovery and $17 goes to the Travel Promotion
Fund. This section would change that allocation such that $10 of
each fee collected is directed to the agency to achieve cost recovery.
$13 per fee is allocated to the Treasury for deficit reduction. In ad-
dition, this section limits the $17 portion directed to the Travel
Promotion Fund to $20 million annually. Once that cap is reached,
the $17 portion of each fee will also be directed to the Treasury for
deficit reduction. Finally, this section extends CBP’s authority to
charge ESTA fees until 2034.
Sec. 70018. Immigration user fees. Currently, air and sea pas-
sengers arriving from a foreign location on a commercial aircraft/
sea vessel pay this fee. This section increases the current $7 fee to
$10 and eliminates a partial exemption for certain commercial sea
passengers. Per fee, $9 is directed to the agency for cost recovery
and $1 is directed to the Treasury for deficit reduction.
Sec. 70019. EVUS fee. The Electronic Visa Update System
(EVUS) provides a mechanism through which information updates
can be obtained from aliens holding a U.S. nonimmigrant visa of
a designated category in a passport issued by an identified country,
generally Chinese nationals on B–1, B–2, and B–1/B–2 visas.
EVUS requires travelers with such visas to provide updated bio-
graphic and travel information to CBP via a publicly accessible
website prior to initial travel on the visa and then at least every
two years from the date of visa issuance for the duration of visa
validity. This section establishes in statute an EVUS fee of $30.
While most of the funds are allocated to the agency for cost recov-
ery, a portion of the funds raised are allocated to the Treasury for
deficit reduction.
Sec. 70020. Fee for sponsor of unaccompanied alien child who
fails to appear in immigration court. This section requires the
sponsor of a UAC to pay a $5,000 fee prior to the release of such
UAC to the sponsor. The sponsor may receive reimbursement for
the fee if the sponsor demonstrates that (1) the UAC was not or-
dered removed in absentia or (2) the in absentia order is rescinded.
Sec. 70021. Fee for aliens ordered removed in absentia. This sec-
tion requires a $5,000 fee for any alien who (1) is ordered removed
in absentia after failing to appear at an immigration court hearing
and (2) is subsequently arrested by ICE. This section includes an
exception for cases in which an in absentia order is rescinded.

MINORITY VIEWS
With their budget reconciliation plan, House Republicans want to
cut hundreds of billions of dollars from essential government pro-
grams and services that the American people rely on—Medicaid,
food assistance for mothers and children, veterans’ benefits, Meals
on Wheels, and more—in order to pay for another giant tax break
for billionaires.
I. OVERVIEW OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE’S
RECONCILIATION PROVISIONS
The House Judiciary Committee’s portion of the reconciliation
package (Title VII), includes more than $81 billion in new spend-
ing. Most of this funding is provided to the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE), primarily for immigration enforce-
ment purposes. The bill includes $45 billion for ICE for family and
adult detention centers; $14.4 billion for transportation and re-
moval operations; $858 million for ICE bonuses and $8 billion for
ICE hiring; $650 million for ICE to facilitate 287(g) agreements
with state and local governments; and more. It also includes $1 bil-
lion for the U.S. Secret Service; $500 million to the Department of
Justice (DOJ) for anti-drug trafficking efforts; and several million
dollars for the Republicans’ anti-regulation agenda. The legislation
also increases existing immigration fees and imposes new ones, in-
cluding—for the first time in our nation’s history—a $1,000 fee im-
posed on people who are applying for asylum.
Subtitles B and C of the GOP’s legislation include expansions of
anti-regulatory bills, including the Regulations from the Executive
in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 142) and the Midnight
Rules Relief Act (H.R. 77); the Interstate Commerce Simplification
Act (H.R. 427); the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act; a provision
that would prevent courts from enforcing contempt citations; and
legislation gutting the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) competi-
tion enforcement authority, the One Agency Act (H.R. 384). Demo-
crats prepared amendments to eliminate all of these dangerous
provisions, and secured a victory when Republicans were forced to
remove the FTC provision from the bill at markup following bipar-
tisan pushback.
II. ‘‘IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT’’
Every day, the Trump Administration uses immigration enforce-
ment as an excuse to violate and erode our rights and liberties.
They round up people in the street and disappear them to the tor-
ture prison of a foreign dictator without even the semblance of Due
Process, in direct violation of the Fifth Amendment. They strip stu-
dents at American universities of their student visas for writing op-
eds the Administration disagrees with, in direct violation of the

First Amendment. President Trump uses extraordinary emergency
wartime powers like the Alien Enemies Act and threatens to in-
voke the Insurrection Act because he imagines an invasion at the
southern border—which he also claims is safer than it has ever
been.
Republicans claim that these extreme and unlawful measures are
necessary to deport gang members, violent criminals, ‘‘the worst of
the worst.’’1 But the Trump Administration is not targeting the
‘‘worst of the worst.’’ They’re using federal agents to round-up law-
abiding members of our communities who have been our friends,
neighbors, and co-workers for decades, parents of American chil-
dren, husbands and wives of American spouses—people who pose
no threat to public safety. Agents are breaking into cars to arrest
mothers as their children watch, terrified.2 They’re arresting people
who are coming in for their citizenship interviews.3 They are stalk-
ing churches, hospitals and schools, staking out people’s homes,
and trolling through Internal Revenue Service taxpayer data in
search of tax-paying people to deport.4 They’re arresting and de-
taining people who are here legally. And they’re making serious
mistakes along the way by trashing Due Process.
In their frenzied attempt to arrest and deport anyone who looks
like they might be an immigrant, they’ve arrested U.S. citizens,
providing false and inaccurate information about why they were
detained.5 They’ve wrongly arrested U.S. citizens—mothers, grand-
mothers, and children—because they were overheard speaking
Spanish.6
The Trump Administration has abandoned the rule of law. If
Donald Trump can sweep noncitizens off the street and fly them to
a torturer’s prison in El Salvador with no Due Process, he can do
it to citizens too, because if there is no Due Process, no fair hear-
ing, you have no opportunity to object.
This bill is a blank check. It hands $81 billion to the Administra-
tion to do more of what we have already seen—mistakenly deport-
ing people to a foreign prison. Deporting a two-year-old U.S. citizen
and a four-year-old U.S. citizen who is battling cancer.7 Sending
masked agents with no identification to snatch students out of

their neighborhoods, hauling them away in unmarked cars and
sending them to a detention center across the country.8
This meaner, smaller version of America is not what the Amer-
ican people want.
It does not need to be this way. We know how to remove people
from the country who should not be here. We know how to do it
legally, consistent with the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and the
legal rights of every person in the United States. We have done it
under Democratic and Republican presidents.
That is why, at our markup, Democrats offered 30 amendments
to rein in some of the Administration’s worst abuses.9 Unfortu-
nately, Republicans silently rejected every single one of these
amendments, refusing to debate or discuss them.
Republicans rejected our amendment requiring the government
to abide by the Constitution and provide Due Process before remov-
ing anyone from the U.S. and sending them to a torture prison in
El Salvador. They rejected an amendment by Representative Nad-
ler to ensure the Trump Administration does not use U.S. taxpayer
dollars to send Americans to foreign dictators’ jails. They even re-
jected an amendment offered by Representative Jayapal to bar the
Trump Administration from detaining and deporting U.S. citizens
to a foreign country.
Judiciary Committee Republicans opposed amendments by Rep-
resentatives Garcia, Crockett, Correa, and Jayapal that would bar
ICE from raiding sensitive locations, including houses of worship,
hospitals, elementary schools, and shelters for survivors of domes-
tic violence.
They opposed an amendment by Representative Garcia to ensure
people who currently have legal protection under the Deferred Ac-
tion for Childhood Arrivals program from being detained and de-
ported. And they opposed amendments to halt ICE’s violation of
the First Amendment and Due Process rights of students at Amer-
ican colleges and universities.
Throughout the markup, our Republican colleagues sat silently,
declining to offer any explanation as they voted against every sin-
gle amendment offered.
III. OTHER PROVISIONS
While the federal courts have provided a meaningful check on
President Trump’s actions so far, House Republicans want to fur-
ther enable President Trump’s worst instincts here as well.
Instead of providing support for the judicial branch, this bill at-
tempts to strip the courts of their power to hold the Administration
in contempt when the President violates court orders, as he ap-
pears dangerously close to doing on so many fronts. Republicans re-
jected an amendment by Representative Johnson to ensure this bill
does not defund courts’ power to hold Administration officials in

contempt for violating court orders and the rights and freedoms of
the American people.
And to make matters worse, as Republicans race to spend more
than $81 billion on ‘‘immigration enforcement,’’ President Trump’s
own DOJ is terminating hundreds of millions of dollars in grants—
they’re cutting funding for law enforcement, cutting funding for
opioid addiction treatment programs, cutting funding for crime pre-
vention programs, and cutting funding for victims of violent
crimes.10 In a shocking move late last month, the Justice Depart-
ment abruptly notified more than 300 grant recipients who work
on precisely these issues that their DOJ grants were terminated
immediately. The Administration’s stated reason for canceling
funding was that the grants no longer aligned with the Administra-
tion’s goals or the agency’s priorities.
This is baffling. These grants support local police in solving and
preventing violent crime. They help the survivors of abuse and sex-
ual assault navigate the legal system and connect them to the re-
sources and support they need. They provide drug addiction treat-
ment services and overdose prevention resources. And yet Judiciary
Committee Republicans, without a word of explanation, voted
against our amendment to reinstate these critical public safety
grants.
And while they hamstring our police, House Republicans are also
trying to handcuff the agencies that work to make sure our food
and drugs are safe, and our air and water are clean.
The supercharged REINS Act is buried in this bill. It would pre-
vent the government from enforcing our civil rights, protecting
workplace safety, and guarding against misconduct by banks and
financial institutions. It would require both houses of Congress and
the President to approve EVERY major rule from federal agencies
for them to take effect—virtually guaranteeing no more regulatory
action on any subject.
This bill also includes the Midnight Rules Relief Act. This meas-
ure would allow Republicans to bundle together lots of regula-
tions—including all of the regulations adopted in the final 365 days
of the prior administration—into a single package and then vote
them down as a single jumbo resolution. This tactic would, of
course, only be used to hide the most destructive deregulatory votes
among dozens of others.
The presence of these and other provisions in this legislation sug-
gests that this is not merely a budgetary bill, but one that includes
significant, unrelated policy changes that may run afoul of the
budget reconciliation process.
IV. CONCLUSION
For all of the reasons discussed above, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,
U.S. CONGRESS,
Washington, DC, April 28, 2025.
Re CBO’s Review of the Reconciliation Recommendations of the
House Committee on the Judiciary.
Hon. JIM JORDAN,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: You have asked the Congressional Budget
Office to review the reconciliation recommendations posted on the
website of the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 28, 2025,
to assess compliance with the instructions included in H. Con. Res
14.1
That resolution instructed the Committee to submit changes in
laws within its jurisdiction that increase the deficit by not more
than $110 billion for the period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034.
CBO estimates that the Committee’s reconciliation recommenda-
tions would increase deficits by less than $110 billion over the
2025–2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits in any
year after 2034.
I hope this information is useful to you. Please contact me if you
have further questions.
Sincerely,
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director.

reconciliation directive in section 2001 of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal
Year 2025, H. Con. Res. 14’’ (April 28, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/yryadsjd.

application for the lease who is qualified to hold a lease under
this chapter shall be entitled to a lease of such lands without
competitive bidding, upon payment of a nonrefundable applica-
tion fee of at least $75. A lease under this subsection shall be

the United States, its agents or employees, which preceded,
and was a major consideration in, the lessee’s expenditure of
funds to develop the property under the lease after the rent
had become due and had not been paid; or if in the judgment
of the Secretary it is equitable to do so for any reason.’’; and

cated prior to February 24, 1920, which has been or is currently
producing or is capable of producing oil or gas, has been or is here-
after deemed conclusively abandoned for failure to file timely the
required instruments or copies of instruments required by section
1744 of title 43, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary
that such failure was inadvertent, justifiable, or not due to lack of
reasonable diligence on the part of the owner, the Secretary may
issue, for the lands covered by the abandoned unpatented oil placer
mining claim, a noncompetitive oil and gas lease, consistent with
the provisions of section 17(e) of this Act, to be effective from the
statutory date the claim was deemed conclusively abandoned.
Issuance of such a lease shall be conditioned upon—
‘‘(1) a petition for issuance of a noncompetitive oil and gas

tions issued by him;

Section 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 226) is further
amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘(r) FEE FOR COMMINGLING OF PRODUCTION.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of the Interior shall ap-
prove applications allowing for the commingling of production
from two or more sources (including the area of an oil and gas
lease, the area included in a drilling spacing unit, a unit par-
ticipating area, a communitized area, or non-Federal property)
before production reaches the point of royalty measurement re-
gardless of ownership, the royalty rates, and the number or
percentage of acres for each source if the applicant pays an ap-
plication fee of $10,000 and agrees to install measurement de-
vices for each source, utilize an allocation method that achieves
volume measurement uncertainty levels within plus or minus
2 percent during the production phase reported on a monthly
basis, or utilize an approved periodic well testing methodology.
Production from multiple oil and gas leases, drilling spacing
units, communitized areas, or participating areas from a single
wellbore shall be considered a single source. Nothing in this
subsection shall prevent the Secretary of the Interior from con-
tinuing the current practice of exercising discretion to author-
ize higher percentage volume measurement uncertainty levels
if appropriate technical and economic justifications have been
provided.
‘‘(2) REVENUE ALLOCATION.—Fees received under this sub-
section shall be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous
receipts.
‘‘(s) FEES FOR PERMITS-BY-RULE.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall establish, by regula-
tion not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this
subsection, a permit-by-rule process under which a leaseholder
may receive approval to drill for oil and gas if the leaseholder
certifies compliance with such regulations and pays a fee of
$5,000. Such permit-by-rule process shall allow drilling oper-
ations to commence no later than 45 days after the leaseholder
has filed a registration that certifies compliance with such reg-
ulations and paid the fee required by this paragraph.

section shall be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous
receipts.’’.

cessor regulations), but subject to any applicable State require-

drill for an oil and gas lease under the Mineral Leasing Act for an
action occurring within an oil and gas drilling or spacing unit if the
leaseholder pays a fee of $5,000 and—
(1) the Federal Government—
(A) owns less than 50 percent of the minerals within the
oil and gas drilling or spacing unit; and
(B) does not own or lease the surface estate within the
area directly impacted by the action; or
(2) the well is located on non-Federal land overlying a non-
Federal mineral estate, but some portion of the wellbore tra-
verses but does not produce from the Federal mineral estate
subject to the lease.
(b) NOTIFICATION.—For each State permit to drill or drilling plan
that would impact or extract oil and gas owned by the Federal Gov-
ernment—
(1) each lessee of Federal minerals in the unit, or designee
of a lessee, shall—
(A) notify the Secretary of the Interior of the submission
of a State application for a permit to drill or drilling plan
on submission of the application;
(B) provide a copy of the application described in sub-
paragraph (A) to the Secretary of the Interior not later
than 5 days after the date on which the permit or plan is

commencing drilling operations, agreements authorizing the
Secretary of the Interior to enter non-Federal land, as nec-
essary, for inspection and enforcement of the terms of the Fed-
eral lease.
(c) EFFECT.—Nothing in this section affects the amount of royal-
ties due to the Federal Government from the production of the Fed-
eral minerals within the oil and gas drilling or spacing unit.
(d) REVENUE ALLOCATION.—Fees received under this section
shall be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
(e) AUTHORITY ON NON-FEDERAL LAND.—Section 17(g) of the
Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 226(g)) is amended—

The Committee Print, as amended, and the accompanying mate-
rials were ordered to be transmitted to the House Committee on
the Budget.
EARMARK STATEMENT
This legislation does not contain any Congressional earmarks,
limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined under
clause 9(e), 9(f), and 9(g) of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of
Representatives.
UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT STATEMENT
An estimate of federal mandates prepared by the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 423 of the Un-
funded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Com-
mittee in time for the filing of this report. The Chair of the Com-
mittee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional
Record upon its receipt by the Committee, if such estimate is not
publicly available on the Congressional Budget Office website.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
A Ramseyer was requested but not yet received. Therefore, with
respect to clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Committee advises that compliance prior to sub-
mission to the Committee on the Budget was not possible.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
This legislation does not establish or reauthorize a program of
the federal government known to be duplicative of another pro-
gram. Such program was not included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139 or identified in the most recent Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance published pursuant to the Federal
Program Information Act (Public Law 95–220, as amended by Pub-
lic Law 98–169) as relating to other programs.

DISSENTING VIEWS
This committee print is the most extreme, anti-environment leg-
islation in American history, and it does nothing to address the
problems facing our country and our constituents.
It’s a billionaires-first, Americans-last giveaway to benefit Big
Oil and polluters, contrived under the sham pretense of an energy
emergency fabricated by President Donald Trump. It guts clean air,
water and climate protections, slashes funding for our national
parks, and sells off our public lands. For the first time, Americans
who simply want their voices heard on Big Oil projects on federal
land will be slapped with fees for daring to protest. Meanwhile, the
legislation will hand out massive subsidies to oil, gas, and coal cor-
porations and would create an unprecedented pay-to-play scheme
allowing polluters to write a check to buy rushed environmental re-
views and total immunity in the courts.
It’s indefensible. Indeed, perhaps literally indefensible. Com-
mittee Republicans not only voted in lockstep for this cartoonishly
extreme measure—they also refused to participate in any public de-
bate or discussion about it other than a few pre-scripted remarks
at the beginning of the 14-hour markup. Knowing how opposed
Americans are to selling off public lands, they waited until the
dead of night to offer an amendment to do that very thing. Com-
mittee Democrats filed 124 amendments, and Republicans refused
to debate a single one. The American people deserved to hear why
Committee Republicans opposed our commonsense amendments
and why they support what’s in this bill.
For example, Republicans must explain why they voted against
amendments that would have blocked the bill’s most egregious pro-
visions and held the Trump Administration accountable by condi-
tioning the bill’s funding on actions like:
• Restoring essential and lifesaving public services like fire-
fighting, weather forecasting, and coastal hazards mitigation;
• Rooting out corruption and conflicts of interest, including
those stemming from Elon Musk and DOGE’s illegal activities;
and
• Repealing the Trump tariff taxes that are hammering
American families and businesses with higher prices and sup-
ply chain uncertainty.
Republicans also voted in lockstep to block holding a public hear-
ing on the committee print, continuing their pattern of ignoring
voters while ramming though a partisan, unpopular anti-environ-
ment agenda. Their unwillingness to stand up to Trump and their
disdain for democracy are making America weaker, less safe, and
less prosperous.
Democrats showed up and fully engaged in debating and chal-
lenging this terrible legislation. We fought back. And we’ll keep
fighting for Americans’ basic freedoms, which include clean air,

safe water, healthy communities, and a livable planet for future
generations.
The committee print’s extreme and reckless provisions are de-
scribed below.
TITLE VIII—COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES
SUBTITLE A—ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES
Part 1—Oil and Gas
Sec. 80101. Onshore Oil and Gas
Requires the Secretary of the Interior to immediately resume
quarterly lease sales for all eligible and nominated lands without
discretion. Lease sales are mandated in Wyoming, New Mexico,
Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, Alas-
ka, and any other state with land available for oil and gas develop-
ment. If a sale is delayed or canceled for any reason, or less than
25 percent of the acres offered receive a bid, then the Secretary
must hold a replacement sale. This section wastes taxpayer re-
sources by forcing the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to hold
unnecessary lease sales, and it will lead to federal agencies selling
off our public lands at cut-rate prices.
Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to:
• Require the Secretary to offer all eligible land for lease if
it has had an expression of interest in the last 18 months.
• Give the Secretary broad discretion to hold oil and gas
lease sales, even if a land use plan is revised.
• Extend an ‘‘application for a permit to drill’’ (APD) validity
to four years (from three).
• Require the Secretary to process APDs and other permits
and authorizations even if there is a pending civil action
against the application.
• Direct the Secretary to use certain categorical exclusions
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for oil
and gas development even if there are ‘‘extraordinary cir-
cumstances’’ that would otherwise require more thorough anal-
ysis.
Sec. 80102. Noncompetitive leasing
Reinstates noncompetitive oil and gas leasing, which was elimi-
nated in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) because it led to the
hoarding of low-priced land by oil and gas companies, much of
which they never bring into production. Ninety-nine percent of non-
competitive leases fail to produce in their ten-year primary term.1
Rather than holding multiple rounds of competitive bidding for
land, land is immediately available for noncompetitive leasing if no
bids are received in the first round. Oil and gas companies are al-
lowed to convert their low-producing leases to noncompetitive
leases with a decreased royalty rate of 12.5 percent (down from
16.67 as enacted by the IRA).

1072
Authorizes the Secretary to reduce royalty rates for noncompeti-
tive leases—possibly even down to ZERO—if it is ‘‘in his judgment
it is equitable to do so’’ or the royalty rate would cause ‘‘undue
hardship’’ or an early end to production.
Sec. 80103. Permit fees
Requires the Secretary to approve applications for the commin-
gling of production from two or more sources of oil and gas before
production reaches the point of royalty measurement if the appli-
cant pays a $10,000 fee and agrees to install measurement devices.
Under current law, commingling applications may be approved if
the different sources being combined all have the same proportion
of federal mineral interest (federal land vs. state vs. private), the
same fixed royalty rate, and the same revenue distribution. More
commingling could exacerbate the Department of the Interior’s on-
going challenges with accurately measuring production and col-
lecting royalties.
Requires the Secretary to establish a permit-by-rule process
where an oil and gas leaseholder may receive an APD if the lease-
holder certifies compliance with regulations themselves and pays a
fee of $5,000. ‘‘Permit by rule’’ means that the reviewing authority
sets a standard of requirements criteria. If an application meets
these criteria, it will be automatically approved and will skip the
final stage of public review.
Sec. 80104. Permitting fee for non-federal land
For a $5,000 fee, no federal permit under the Mineral Leasing
Act is needed for oil and gas exploration and production that hap-
pens on non-federal lands but taps into federal subsurface oil and
gas mineral estate. This applies as long as the operator has a state
drilling permit and less than 50 percent of the oil and gas to be
accessed is federally owned. The Secretary of the Interior may not
require a bond, impose mitigation requirements, or require ap-
proval for reclamation for lands described under this section. De-
velopment under this section ‘‘shall require no federal action’’ and
may begin as soon as 30 days after the leaseholder submits the
state permit to the Secretary.
This section could degrade private and state lands, particularly
in split-estate scenarios where the federal government owns the
subsurface estate and another party owns the surface estate. An
operator could start drilling on private land and freely access fed-
eral subsurface estate underneath a third party’s property, with no
notice or opportunity for that landowner to raise concerns. By
eliminating federal bonding requirements, private landowners or
state taxpayers would be left with the bill if an oil company made
a mess and refused to clean it up.
Sec. 80105. Reinstate reasonable royalty rates
Reduces the range of offshore oil and gas royalty rates from be-
tween 16.67 and 18.75 to between 12.5 and 18.75 percent, lowering
the royalty rate floor. Royalties could be reduced further at the Sec-
retary’s discretion, per the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Re-
duces onshore oil and gas royalty rates from 16.67 to 12.5 percent.

These royalty rates were increased through the IRA to provide
a fair return for taxpayers. Instead, this bill would prioritize sub-
sidies to an industry that pollutes our lands, air, water, and bodies,
all while enjoying massive profits obtained by price-gouging the
American public—in some cases through illegal collusion with
OPEC. As a further insult, these wasteful handouts are included
in the same bill that will cut Medicaid and food assistance for the
most vulnerable Americans.
Part II—Geothermal
Sec. 801 1. Geothermal leasing
Amends the Geothermal Steam Act by requiring one lease sale
for geothermal energy every year rather than one every two years.
If the annual sale is canceled or delayed, the Secretary must hold
a replacement sale. The Secretary is required to include all nomi-
nated parcels for geothermal development under a state’s approved
resource development plan. This would increase geothermal leasing
while respecting the public resource planning process, which Com-
mittee Democrats support.
Sec. 801 2. Geothermal royalties
Amends the royalty structure in the Geothermal Steam Act to
apply to each ‘‘electric generating facility producing electricity’’ on
a geothermal lease. This gives additional discretion to the Sec-
retary to change royalty rates on a facility-by-facility basis.
Part III—Alaska
Sec. 80121. Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing
Directs the Secretary to withdraw the Supplemental Environ-
mental Impact Statement (SEIS) prepared by the Biden adminis-
tration to review the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program
and Record of Decision (ROD), which called for an end to the pro-
gram. Secretary Burgum already took this action on March 20,
2025.
Reissues the leases that were canceled by the Biden administra-
tion under the terms from the Trump administration in 2020,
which was previously ordered by a federal court in Alaska and also
already acted on in March 2025.2
Requires at least four new area-wide lease sales on the coastal
plain in the next seven years, offering at least 400,000 acres each
time. Directs the Secretary to issue all necessary rights of way,
permits, biological opinions, incidental take statements, to develop
said leases, and waives permitting requirements of ANILCA,
NEPA, the Tax Act, ESA, and MMPA. Judicial review is waived ex-
cept for challenges by the State of Alaska or any leaseholder. Rev-
enue will be split 50–50 between the state of Alaska and the fed-
eral government for the next ten years, then after 2035, it switches
to 90–10 between Alaska and the federal government. Seismic test-
ing will be approved on a 30-day timeline. If the Secretary fails to
comply with deadlines in this section, leaseholders can petition the
2US Department of Interior, ‘‘Interior Secretary Takes Steps to Unleash Alaska’s Extraor-
dinary Resource Potential,’’ March 20, 2025.

courts to force action within 90 days—a remarkable exception in a
bill that repeatedly strips the general public of their rights to ac-
cess the courts.
Sec. 80122. National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska
Ceases implementation of the Biden administration’s NPR–A
rule, which protected ecologically sensitive areas from oil and gas
development. Within one year of enactment, the Secretary is re-
quired to hold lease sales in the region once every two years.
Rights of way, easements, and other authorizations will not be sub-
ject to judicial review, including any pending litigation. The State
of Alaska and any leaseholders (but not others) may pursue judicial
review, and if the court finds a violation of the act, it must order
the agency to remedy the violation within 90 days. Revenue will be
split 50–50 between the state of Alaska and the federal government
for the next ten years, then after 2035, it switches to 90–10 be-
tween Alaska and the federal government. Seismic testing will be
approved on a 30-day timeline.
Part IV—Mining
Neither of the mining sections in this scorched-earth giveaway to
polluters would bring common sense to our woefully antiquated
General Mining Act of 1872. Under current law, corporations can
engage in destructive mining on our public lands—which consumes
valuable water and leaves behind toxic pollution—and then carry
off the public’s mineral resources for free. Not even oil and gas re-
ceive such a generous handout.
Worse, these outdated laws allow even our foreign adversaries to
take our collectively owned mineral wealth for free—enriching our
adversaries at our expense. To be clear, under current law, compa-
nies literally owned by America’s foreign adversaries (state-owned
companies) can mine public lands by setting up a subsidiary, and
then they don’t even pay us for the minerals they take back. At the
markup on this committee print, Republicans voted against a
Democratic amendment to ban our foreign adversaries from mining
on our public lands. Republicans also voted against a Democratic
amendment to require our foreign adversaries to at least pay us for
the minerals they take from us. What happened to America First?
What happened to not letting foreign adversaries rip us off? The
public can only guess as to why Republicans opposed these amend-
ments, because they refused to explain their votes or to engage in
any debate on the matter.
Sec. 80131. Superior National Forest Lands in Minnesota
Voids Public Land Order 7917, the 225,000-acre withdrawal sur-
rounding the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW)
and reinstates Twin Metals’ leases in the region on extended 20-
year terms with rights to non-discretionary renewals. The rein-
statement of leases is not subject to judicial review, except of
course for a leaseholder to seek judicial review regarding an alleged
failure by the Secretary under this section.
The Boundary Waters in Northeastern Minnesota is a pristine
wilderness. It is a treasure beloved by countless Americans and is
the most visited Wilderness Area in the country. It also supports

a thriving outdoor recreation economy with hundreds of thousands
of annual visitors and tens of thousands of jobs across North-
eastern Minnesota.
Twin Metals Minnesota—a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chil-
ean mining company Antofagasta—has been pushing to build a sul-
fide-ore copper mine in the Boundary Waters watershed for over a
decade. In 2016, after an extensive environmental review process,
including public input and scientific analysis, the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice concluded sulfide-ore copper mining—which is significantly dif-
ferent from the taconite mining the region is used to—could result
in ‘‘extreme’’ and ‘‘serious and irreparable harm’’ in the watershed
of this Wilderness Area. All operational U.S. copper sulfide mines
have leaked polluted mine waste. The Forest Service found that
any spills, leaks, or pollution from the Twin Metals mine would be
all but impossible to contain, putting the entire ecosystem at risk.
Sec. 80132. Ambler Road in Alaska
Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act
(ANILCA) to require the issuance of all rights-of-way, permits, and
other authorizations for the Ambler Road, a 211-mile mining road
through the Gates of the Arctic National Preserve. Reinstates the
March 2020 Joint Record of Decision, Alternative A for Ambler
Road, which approves the road and waives all applicable federal
laws with no judicial review. Requires an annual $500,000 rental
fee for the Ambler Road right-of-way for fiscal years 2025-2034. For
years, numerous Alaska Native communities have strongly opposed
this project, with eighty-nine Tribes and First Nations passing or
signing onto resolutions against the Ambler Road.
Part V—Coal
Sec. 80141. Coal Leasing
For all applications for a coal lease sale, the Secretary is required
to publish an environmental review, hold a lease sale, and issue
the lease within 90 days. This section directs the Secretary to make
4,000,000 acres in the West available for coal leasing (non-competi-
tive) that are not otherwise withdrawn.
Sec. 80142. Future Coal Leasing
Voids Secretary Jewell’s Secretarial Order SO 3338 (coal morato-
rium while evaluating the federal coal leasing program) and any
other actions limiting the federal coal leasing program. This SO
was already withdrawn by the first Trump administration and
never reinstated by the Biden administration.
Sec. 80143. Coal Royalty
Decreases coal royalty from 12.5 to 7 percent, with discretion to
go lower, and retroactively applies this to all active coal leases. As
with this bill’s provisions lowering oil and gas royalties, this section
prioritizes subsidies to an industry that pollutes our lands, air,
water, and bodies. We should be investing in the competitive,
clean, renewable energy technologies of the future, which create
jobs and drive down electricity prices—instead of trying to revive
an industry that is not going to come back. As a further insult,

these wasteful handouts are included in the same bill that will cut
Medicaid and food assistance for the most vulnerable Americans.
Sec. 80144. Authorization to mine federal minerals
Automatically authorizes the Bull Mountain coal mine plan
modification, which the courts have repeatedly struck down for not
considering climate impacts. The Bull Mountain Mine is extremely
controversial, and the owner of the mine, Signal Peak, is currently
on probation with the Department of Justice (DOJ) after criminal
convictions for environmental and safety violations.3 These include
more than 122 accidents and more than 1,600 citations of mine
safety violations.4 To preserve the mine’s reputation, Signal Peak
leadership pressured mine employees ‘‘not to report injuries that
occurred while on duty, using over and implicit pressure, threats,
and bribes.’’5
Part VI—NEPA
Sec. 80151. Project sponsor opt-in fees for environmental reviews.
Establishes a pay-to-play pathway for any project subject to
NEPA review. If a project sponsor or developer pays 125 percent
of the estimated review cost, then a six-month deadline is estab-
lished to complete an Environmental Assessment (EA) and a one-
year deadline to complete an Environmental Impact Statements
(EIS). The EA or EIS could also be prepared by the project sponsor.
EIS reviews are typically reserved for the roughly 1 percent of
projects that are the largest, most complex and controversial, with
the greatest potential for environmental and public health im-
pacts—realities and challenges that this section tries to wish away.
This section also eliminates administrative and judicial review of
the adequacy of any EA or EIS completed under this program.
In effect, this section allows well-financed project sponsors to buy
a one-year EIS (or a six-month EA) and immunity from lawsuits
and judicial or administrative accountability—even in cases of fla-
grantly inadequate NEPA reviews.
Sec. 80152. Recission relating to environmental and climate data
collection
Rescinds unobligated funds from section 60401 of the Inflation
Reduction Act. These funds support data collection efforts related
to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) EJ-Screen tool and
disproportionate climate and pollution impacts.

Part VII—Miscellaneous
Sec. 80161. Protest fees
The Minerals Leasing Act of 1920 allows individuals or groups
to file protests challenging the Bureau of Land Management’s oil
and gas leasing decisions. This section adds a $150 fee to file a pro-
test, with an additional $5 per page for each page over 10 pages.
If the protest submission covers more than one lease parcel, right-
of-way, or application for permit to drill, it assesses an additional
$10 per lease parcel, right-of-way, or application for permit to drill.
These protest filing fees are indexed to inflation (unlike the re-
duced oil and gas royalties, the reduced coal royalties, or the pay-
to-play provision under this bill, of course).
This section targets members of the public, including hunters
and anglers, private landowners, and local elected officials, who
simply want their voices heard when oil companies try to lease in
sensitive wildlife habitats, on their ranches, or next to national
parks. For example, if an oil company tried to lease split-estate
lands to drill for oil under a private ranch, it could cost the rancher
several hundred dollars to file a formal protest.
Part VIII—Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing
Sec. 80171. Mandatory offshore oil and gas lease sales
For all lease sales under this title, no new analysis is required
under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Marine Mammal Protec-
tion Act (MMPA), NEPA, or Coastal Zone Management Act
(CZMA), and it prohibits the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
(BOEM) from instituting risk-reduction measures to protect the
critically endangered Rice’s whale. It also allows the Secretary to
waive any requirement of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
that the Secretary determines is slowing down leasing. This section
allows state governors to nominate areas adjacent to their state
waters, which BOEM must include in the next lease sale, and re-
quires geological and geophysical survey permits (seismic testing)
to be approved within 30 days.
Requires 30 lease sales over the next 15 years in the Gulf of
Mexico (two annually). Each lease sale must amount to the entire
region, or whatever remains that is unleased. This section also re-
quires six lease sales in the Cook Inlet of one million acres each,
or whatever remains if less than one million acres. Beginning in
2035, 90 percent of all revenues from leases issued offshore of Alas-
ka pursuant to this section will go to the State of Alaska and 10
percent to the Treasury. No leases awarded under this section in
either area can be cancelled, and it prevents the Secretary from im-
posing any additional terms on these leases, such as risk-reduction
measures to avoid harming the critically endangered Rice’s whale
(only 51 remain, all in the U.S. portion of the Gulf of Mexico). For
all leases under this section, this section permanently reinstates a
Biological Opinion that essentially waives all ESA and MMPA re-
quirements for oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico. Judicial
review for all permits under this section is limited to any circuit
courts in the affected state. This section also decreases revenue to
the Treasury by eliminating the cap on revenue-sharing to states

through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act for 10 years. This
section absurdly refers to the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘‘Gulf of Amer-
ica.’’
Sec. 80172. Offshore commingling
Allows for comingling of offshore production unless ‘‘conclusive
evidence’’ establishes that such comingling can’t be done safely or
would reduce the total amount of oil recovered from those res-
ervoirs. This section also uses the unserious term ‘‘Gulf of Amer-
ica.’’
Sec. 80173. Limitations on amounts of distributed qualified Outer
Continental Shelf revenues
Lifts the cap on revenue-sharing to states through the Gulf of
Mexico Energy Security Act.
Part IX—Renewable Energy
Sec. 80181. Renewable energy fees on federal land
Increases rents and fees for onshore wind and solar. Acreage-
based rental rates are increased according to a fee. Once the re-
newable energy project begins producing, they will pay as a ‘‘capac-
ity fee’’ (royalty) either the acreage rental fee or 4.58 percent of the
gross proceeds of the sale of the electricity generated. Wind projects
may apply for a multiple-use reduction factor to their capacity fee
if 25 percent or more of the land within their right of way is used
for activities other than wind generation. The Office of Natural Re-
sources Revenue (ONRR) will publish wind and solar energy reve-
nues collected on its website.
If renewable energy projects are more than 15 days late paying
their fees, the Secretary may charge a late fee; if the project holder
is more than 90 days late, the Secretary may terminate the right-
of-way (lease). The bill does not place such conditions on oil, gas,
or coal, of course.
Repeals the Secretary’s authority, originally included in the bi-
partisan Energy Act of 2020 signed into law by President Trump,
to reduce acreage rates and capacity fees for wind and solar based
on economic conditions or in pursuit of promoting the use of wind
and solar.
Sec. 80182. Renewable energy revenue sharing
Twenty-five percent of renewable revenues shall go to the state
where those revenues are generated, and 25 percent to the county
where it is generated. This shall be in addition to payments in lieu
of taxes.
SUBTITLE B—WATER, WILDLIFE, AND FISHERIES
This subtitle rescinds unobligated IRA balances from the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that fund improve-
ments to NOAA labs and facilities, including the National Marine
Sanctuaries, and supports coastal restoration and habitat resil-
ience, fisheries science and stock assessments, and innovative cli-
mate readiness programs. Last year, former NOAA administrator
Rick Spinrad reported to the House Committee on Natural Re-

sources that the amount of funding needed for qualified coastal and
marine habitat restoration projects is 28 times higher than what
NOAA could fund with IRA and Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) money. Rescinding these balances further exacer-
bates these needs, taking money away from important fishery re-
search and stock assessment priorities and coastal and Great
Lakes communities around the country.
This subtitle also appropriates $2.5 billion to Bureau of Reclama-
tion storage and conveyance projects. While not explicitly named,
these funds are intended for the Shasta Dam and the Friant-Kern
Canal projects in California.
Sec. 80201. Recission of funds for investing in coastal communities
and climate resilience
Rescinds unobligated funds from Section 40001 of the Inflation
Reduction Act. These funds support conservation and restoration of
marine and coastal habitats, Pacific salmon and other marine fish-
eries, and fisheries science and stock assessments.
Sec. 80202. Recission of funds for facilities of National Oceanic At-
mospheric Administration and National Marine Sanctuaries
Rescinds unobligated funds from Section 40002 of the Inflation
Reduction Act. These funds support construction and replacement
of piers, marine operations facilities, fisheries laboratories, and Na-
tional Marine Sanctuary System facilities.
Sec. 80203. Surface water storage enhancement
Appropriates $2 billion to increase the storage capacity of Bureau
of Reclamation storage facilities. This targets the proposed Shasta
Dam raise, a project that would violate California law by inun-
dating the McCloud River—a state-protected Wild and Scenic
River—and submerging sacred sites of the Winnemum Wintu
Tribe. This provision also waives standard non-federal cost-share
requirements, effectively authorizing full federal funding for the
project.
Sec. 80204. Water conveyance enhancement
Appropriates $500 million for restoring and increasing the stor-
age capacity of existing Bureau of Reclamation conveyance facili-
ties. This targets repairs and potential expansion of the Friant-
Kern Canal in California. Like section 80203, this provision waives
standard non-federal cost-share requirements, effectively author-
izing full federal funding for the project.
SUBTITLE C—FEDERAL LANDS
This subtitle continues the theme of handing over our public
lands to the highest bidder and overturing protections for sensitive
and cherished landscapes. Sections 80301–80305 would strip away
recent conservation gains by blocking the implementation of key
planning documents designed to promote climate resilience and
balanced development across millions of acres of public land. Addi-
tionally, the subtitle would rescind unobligated IRA balances to
claw back funds designed to promote old growth conservation, in-
vest in climate restoration and habitat restoration across our public

lands and national parks, and support new employees at the Na-
tional Park Service (NPS). Initial Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) estimates indicate a $257 million reduction in funds avail-
able to hire employees at units of the National Park System. Re-
scinding these funds sends the message that Congress supports the
Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the federal work-
force—efforts that betray the public support for our national parks.
Additionally, leaning into an Executive Order issued by Presi-
dent Trump, the subtitle directs the Forest Service and BLM to in-
crease timber production on national forests and public lands by
25%. This is an arbitrary increase with no direct connection to
wildfire risk reduction or community resilience. In fact, an over-
zealous emphasis on commercial logging could threaten treasured
old-growth trees and degrade forests that provide clean air, clean
water, and abundant wildlife habitat.
Finally, a surprise late-night amendment from Representative
Amodei directs the BLM and Forest Service to sell hundreds of
thousands of acres of public land in Nevada and Utah. The amend-
ment was filed without any notice and was not accompanied by
maps or any other background material to shed light on the spe-
cifics of the proposed sales. Further, the amendment includes land
in Clark County, Nevada, and was filed over the objections of the
Democratic Members who actually represent the area. Proceeds
from all of the authorized sales will be deposited in the U.S. Treas-
ury rather than reinvested in conservation. This betrays a long-
standing commitment to balance economic development with long-
term and durable protections for public land and outdoor recreation
in Southern Nevada and throughout the country.
Sec. 80301. Prohibition on the implementation of the Rock Springs
Field Office, Wyoming, Resource Management Plan
Prohibits the implementation and administration of the Resource
Management Plan (RMP) for the BLM’s Rock Springs Field Office
in Wyoming. This targets a plan developed through rigorous public
input designed to strike a fair balance between development and
conservation in order to prioritize oil and gas development and
mining over all other considerations.
Sec. 80302. Prohibition on the implementation of the Buffalo Field
Office, Wyoming, Resource Management Plan
Prohibits the implementation and administration of the RMP for
the BLM’s Buffalo Field Office in Wyoming. This targets a plan de-
veloped by the Biden administration designed to suspended future
coalleasing in the Powder River Basin in order to reduce emissions
and promote sustainable land management.
Sec. 80303. Prohibition on the implementation of the Miles City
Field Office, Montana, Resource Management Plan
Prohibits the implementation and administration of the RMP for
the BLM’s Miles City Filed Office in Montana in order to prioritize
coal production over all other considerations. This targets yet an-
other plan developed by the Biden administration designed to sus-
pend future coal leasing in the Powder River Basin in order to re-
duce emissions and promote sustainable land management.

Sec. 80304. Prohibition on the implementation of the North Dakota
Resource Management Plan
Prohibits the implementation and administration of the RMP for
the BLM’s North Dakota Field Office in order to prioritize oil and
gas development and coal mining over all other considerations.
Sec. 80305. Prohibition on the implementation of the Colorado River
Valley Field Office Resource Management Plans
Prohibits the implementation and administration of the RMP for
the BLM’s Grand Junction and Colorado River Valley Field Office
in order to prioritize oil and gas development and mining over all
other considerations. This targets plans developed to better incor-
porate the climate impacts of oil and gas development and rolls
back protections for conservation, habitat preservation, river vital-
ity, and areas of tribal and historic significance.
Sec. 80306. Rescission of Forest Service Funds
Rescinds unobligated balances from the Inflation Reduction Act
that fund the protection and mapping of old-growth forests in the
National Forest System.
Sec. 80307. Recission of National Park Service and Bureau of Land
Management Funds
Rescinds unobligated balances from the Inflation Reduction Act
that fund conservation and climate resilience projects on NPS and
BLM lands.
Sec. 80308. Recission of Bureau of Land Management and National
Park Service Funds
Rescinds unobligated balances from the Inflation Reduction Act
that fund habitat restoration projects on NPS and BLM lands.
Sec. 80309. Recission of National Park Service Funds
Rescinds unobligated balances from the Inflation Reduction Act
that fund hiring employees to serve in the National Park System.
Rescinding such funds is an outrageous affront as President Trump
is actively working to dismantle and undermine the NPS. Since the
beginning of 2025, the agency has lost 12.5 percent of the entire
workforce. Our National Parks have been characterized as Amer-
ica’s Best Idea. House Republicans are walking away from that
sentiment and abandoning a deep-rooted national priority.
Sec. 80310. Celebrating America’s 250th Anniversary
Appropriates $150 million for events and activities related to the
celebration of the 250th anniversary of the United States. Appro-
priates $40 million to establish and maintain the ‘‘Garden of Amer-
ican Heroes,’’ a proposed statuary park intended to recognize ‘‘great
figures of America’s history’’ as determined by President Trump.
Sec. 80311. Long-term contracts for the Forest Service
Requires the Forest Service to enter into at least one 20-year
timber sale or stewardship contract in each region of the Forest
Service for each of the fiscal years 2025—2034.

Requires BLM to enter into at least one 20-year timber sale or
stewardship contract for the fiscal years 2025–2034.
Sec. 80313. Timber Production for the Forest Service
Requires the Forest Service to increase timber production by 25
percent over production levels in 2024. This matches an Executive
Order issued by President Trump, and it is strictly designed to in-
crease logging in national forests without any regard for wildfire
mitigation or other considerations.
Sec. 80314. Timber Production for the Bureau of Land Management
Requires BLM to increase timber production by 25 percent over
production levels in 2024.
Sec. 80315. Bureau of Land Management in Nevada
Directs the BLM to sell hundreds of thousands of acres of public
land in Lyon, Clark, Washoe, and Pershing Counties in Nevada.
The proceeds from the sales are directed to the U.S. Treasury.
Sec. 80316. Forest Service Land in Nevada
Directs the Forest Service to sell parcels of the National Forest
System in Washoe County, Nevada. The proceeds from the sales
are directed to the U.S. Treasury.
Sec. 80317. Federal Land in Utah
Directs the BLM to sell tens of thousands of acres of land in Bea-
ver and Washington Counties in Utah. The proceeds from the sales
are directed to the U.S. Treasury.

nual rate resulting from averaging the individual’s rates of
basic pay in effect over any 3 consecutive years of cred-

SUMMARY OF BUDGETARY PROVISIONS IN THE COMMITTEE PRINT
Section 90001 of the Committee Print providing for reconciliation
pursuant to H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution on the
Budget for Fiscal Year 2025 (‘‘Committee Print’’) would achieve
$31,801,000,000 in revenue increases by raising the Federal Em-
ployees Retirement System (FERS) employee contribution rate for
certain existing federal civilian employees and postal service em-
ployees hired before 2014 up to the current rate of 4.4% of their
annual salary (or 4.9% in the case of Members and Congressional
staff hired before 2013). This increase is incrementally phased-in
over two years, such that the full increase is in effect starting on
January 1, 2027. Exempted from this Section’s effects are federal
law enforcement officers, federal firefighters, U.S. Capitol and Su-
preme Court police officers, air traffic controllers, nuclear materials
couriers, and customs and border protection officers.
Section 90002 of the Committee Print would save
$10,034,000,000 by eliminating the additional retirement annuity
payment for new federal retirees that are eligible to retire before
age 62 which they currently receive until they reach the age of So-
cial Security retirement eligibility (exempted from this legislative
change are those mandatorily separated from federal occupations
subject to statutory separation requirements).
Section 90003 of the Committee Print would save $3,100,000,000
by reducing federal pension benefit spending by basing new retir-
ees’ annuity payments on their average highest five earning years
(instead of the highest three years) with a delay in enactment so
that this change goes into effect for those retiring after January 1,
2027. Exempted from this Section’s effects are current retirees, fed-
eral law enforcement officers, federal firefighters, U.S. Capitol and
Supreme Court police officers, air traffic controllers, nuclear mate-
rials couriers, and customs and border protection officers.
Section 90004 of the Committee Print would achieve
$4,541,000,000 in net savings by raising the FERS employee con-
tribution rates by 5 percentage points—thus raising additional rev-
enue—for newly hired Federal employees who elect to maintain ex-
isting civil service employment protections. Those new hires who
elect to serve ‘‘at-will’’ will pay the FERS employee contribution
rates applicable to new employees under existing law. Thus, those
who elect to serve ‘‘at-will’’ will in effect receive higher take-home
pay than their peers who do not.
Section 90005 of the Committee Print would raise $3,000,000 in
revenue by charging a fee for Merit Systems Protection Board
(MSPB) filings (an amount equal to a District Court filing fee).
This fee would be refunded to those employees who win their ap-
peals.
Section 90006 of the Committee Print would achieve
$1,472,000,000 in net savings by requiring, and directing
$80,000,000 in funding for, the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) to conduct a comprehensive audit of employee dependents
currently enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Pro-
gram (FEHBP) plans—verifying marriage certificates and birth cer-
tificates, for instance—and requiring that ineligible individual
found to be receiving FEHB coverage be disenrolled. The section

also directs $473,267,927 in funding for OPM to develop, maintain,
and conduct oversight over FEHBP systems and directs
$50,057,934 to the OPM inspector general to audit the enrollment
and eligibility in FEHBP systems.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Federal Retirement Revenue and Budget Saving Provisions:
The Committee recognizes that the federal workforce enjoys ben-
efits—including generous retirement plan incentives—that largely
outpace those received by the private sector workforce. According
to an April 2024 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, in 2022
‘‘benefits cost about $31 per hour worked, on average, for federal
employees and $22 per hour worked for private-sector employees
. . . [t]hus, benefits for federal workers cost 43 percent more per
hour worked, on average, than benefits for private-sector workers’’
and such ‘‘[b]enefits also constituted a larger share of total com-
pensation for federal workers (40 percent) than for workers in the
private sector (30 percent).’’1 World-class employment benefits pro-
vided to federal employees can include eleven paid holidays; var-
ious incentives and awards; health, life, and long-term care insur-
ance; flexible spending accounts; student loan repayment and for-
giveness plans; generous leave and workplace flexibilities; and
childcare, professional development, and commuter subsidies.2
Federal employees receive particularly generous retirement bene-
fits. These are comprised of both defined contribution (in the form
of the defined contribution 401(k) equivalent Thrift Savings Plan
(TSP) investment program) and defined benefit retirement plans
(in the form of annuities). By comparison, the 2024 Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) National Compensation Survey indicates
that only 15% of the private sector civilian workforce had access to
both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.3 The Fiscal
Year 2019 budget request to Congress noted that ‘‘[p]rivate sector
employers provide a smaller share of compensation in the form of
retirement benefits than does the Federal Government.’’4
Federal annuity costs are shared by the employee and federal
government. Although employees contribute, the Government pays
a significant share of the cost of federal employee defined benefit
pensions. It is future taxpayers who will need to pay for unfunded
federal employee pension obligations. In 2012, Congress sought to
better balance the cost of these pensions by increasing the em-
ployee cost-share for the Federal Employees Retirement System
(FERS)—the defined benefit retirement plan established by Con-
gress in 1986—for new hires to 3.1% and later in 2013 to 4.4% of

the employees’ gross salaries.5 Since these changes only applied
prospectively to those hired following date(s) of enactment, those
enrolled before these changes were enacted continued to pay the
lower, 0.8% employee contribution rate.
Better balancing the share of federal employee retirement costs
between employees and taxpayers (and bringing federal employee
retirement benefits into better alignment with their private sector
peers) raises revenue for the Federal government and helps reduce
the budget deficit. Currently, federal and Congressional employees
and Members of Congress hired after December 31, 2013 contribute
10.6% of their salary (minus the current 6.2% Social Security tax
rate which reaches the effective 4.4% FERS salary contribution
rate seen in employee paychecks) into the FERS system, while law
enforcement officers, firefighters, members of the Capitol Police,
members of the Supreme Court Police, air traffic controllers, nu-
clear materials couriers, and customs and border protection officers
pay 11.1% (to accommodate their eligibility for ‘‘enhanced’’ FERS
retirement benefits—effectively 4.9% after the 6.2% Social Security
tax rate is subtracted). However, Cohorts of federal employees
hired on or prior to that date contribute less, ranging down to an
effective 0.8% employee contribution rate.
Sec. 90001 of the Committee Print brings all current cohorts of
employees into parity, with respect to their FERS contributions.
This, generates an estimated $31,801,000,000 in revenue for budget
deficit reduction over ten years. Exempted, however, from these
new FERS contribution changes are law enforcement officers, fire-
fighters, members of the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court Police,
air traffic controllers, nuclear materials couriers, and customs and
border protection officers from any increased FERS contribution
rates.
When a federal employee enrolled in FERS qualifies for, and re-
ceives, an ‘‘immediate retirement’’ benefit before attaining the eligi-
bility age to qualify for Social Security, they become eligible to re-
ceive a supplemental retirement benefit payment in addition to
their FERS annuity payment. The Fiscal Year 2019 budget request
notes how the ‘‘supplement partially replaces the Social Security
portion of the retirement package’’ and ‘‘[w]hen private sector em-
ployees retire before Social Security eligibility age, no such supple-
ment is provided.’’6
Sec. 90002 of the committee print generates an estimated
$10,034,000,000 in budget savings by eliminating the FERS annu-
ity supplement and associated costs of supplementing the already
generous defined benefit system for those employees who retire
after the date of enactment. Exempted from this change, however,
are, those who separate from service under federal mandatory sep-
aration requirements (as required under 5 U.S.C. 8425) (i.e., man-
datory retirement, which is set at age 57 for law enforcement offi-
cers and related personnel and at age 56 for air traffic controllers).

Federal employee annuity payments are currently based on an
average of their highest three years of salaried earnings during
their years of service. The Fiscal Year 2021 budget request in-
cluded a proposal to calculate federal ‘‘employees’ annuity based on
the ‘High-5’ highest earning salary years instead of the ‘High-3’
highest earning salary years’’ in order to ‘‘bring Federal retirement
benefits more in line with the private sector, while reducing their
long-term costs.’’7 The 2021 budget request further details how
‘‘Federal retirement annuity calculations are based on the average
of the Federal employee’s three highest salary-earning years’’ while
‘‘[p]rivate sector pension companies commonly base employee annu-
ity calculations on the employee’s five highest salary-earning years,
a formula more representative of an employee’s career earnings.’’
While exempting law enforcement officers, members of the U.S.
Capitol and Supreme Court Police, firefighters, nuclear materials
couriers, air traffic controllers, and customs and border protection
officers, Sec. 90003 alters the annuity calculation such that it uses
the average of the top FIVE consecutive years of service for, those
retiring on or after January 1, 2027. This will generate an esti-
mated $3,100,000,000 in budget savings to reduce the deficit.
The changes to FERS calculations and benefits in Sections
90001–90003 would also apply to the U.S. Postal Service workforce
which participate in FERS, but would not impact military service
members since they are in the separate military retirement system
(unless they transfer into the federal civilian workforce and opt out
of the military retirement system).
Lastly, to further reduce the federal government’s cost of funding
federal employee retirement benefits into the future, Sec. 90004
would amend the law to require new federal employee hires after
the date of enactment to elect to serve ‘‘at will’’ in exchange for
higher take- home pay than their peers. This provision would raise
$4,541,000,000 in estimated net decrease in the deficit through new
revenue over ten years. New hires after the date of enactment
would have a five-percentage point increase in their FERS con-
tribution rate, relative to current law, unless they choose to work
on an at-will basis.
Revenue Generation with Federal Employee Disciplinary Appeal Fil-
ing Fees:
With a nearly $50 million annual budget, the Merit Systems Pro-
tection Board (MSPB) is charged primarily with ‘‘adjudicating indi-
vidual employee appeals’’ and providing federal employees with an
opportunity to argue their case before a federal administrative
judge, present evidence in their own defense, call supporting wit-
nesses, and cross-examine witnesses.8 In Fiscal Year 2023 alone,

the MSPB reported a backlog of 1,884 cases with 4,135 total ap-
peals being decided (68.1% of which were dismissed outright).9
Recognizing the volume of these cases, Sec. 90005 of the Com-
mittee Print would raise additional revenue by requiring a modest
fee for bringing a case filing before the MSPB (equal to a district
court filing fee). The fee be refunded to employees who win their
appeals. This provision is estimated to generate $3,000,000 in addi-
tional revenue over ten years, contributing to deficit reduction.
Federal Employee Health Plan Enrollment Audit Budget Savings:
The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) is the
largest self-funded health plan in the United States.10 According to
a 2022 GAO report, the FEHBP covers approximately 8.2 million
individuals, including 2.2 million federal employees, 1.9 million re-
tirees, and an estimated 4.1 million family members costing ap-
proximately $59 billion of combined annual premiums paid by the
government and enrollees.11
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers the
FEHBP, contracting with approximately 87 health insurance car-
riers offering over 270 health care coverage options for eligible em-
ployees and family members. However, the program operates under
a diffused management structure spread over 160 government em-
ploying offices individually responsible for enrollment, fraud risk
management, and eligibility verification for those receiving FEHB
coverage. OPM’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) estimates
the annual cost of fraud and improper payments associated with
ineligible members being enrolled in the FEHBP is between $250
million and $3 billion.12
While OPM has taken steps to enable employing offices and
FEHB carriers to identify and remove ineligible FEHB members—
such as providing that employing offices and FEHB carriers may
request proof of family member eligibility at any time for existing
participants—these accountability measures are not required in
law and are therefore not achieving the potential budgetary sav-
ings. Specifically, although OPM now requires employing offices
and insurance carriers to verify family members’ eligibility for new-
hire and qualifying life event (QLE) transactions, OPM cannot rea-
sonably ensure such verification is actually taking place due to the
current FEHBP administrative structure.
Sec. 90006 of the Committee Print requires OPM to verify the
eligibility of family members for FEHBP coverage and enrollment
by conducting a government-wide audit in order to determine the
eligibility of family members and dependents currently receiving
FEHBP coverage. The legislation specifically mandates the
disenrollment or removal of any ineligible individual from FEHBP

coverage, thus saving associated federal agency retiree health care
plan costs. In total, this legislative requirement is estimated to re-
duce on-budget deficits by $1,472,000,000 over ten years.
Further, to improve FEHBP system management and ensure on-
going oversight of enrollments Sec. 90006 directs annual funding to
be derived from the FEHBP trust fund itself to consolidate the
FEHB program administration within OPM and ensure the OPM
OIG is effectively equipped to conduct ongoing oversight of federal
health plan enrollments.13
Federal employees and American taxpayers share in the costs as-
sociated with FEHBP coverage, including program administration.
The budgetary savings achieved by this government-wide audit and
improved ongoing oversight of the FEHB program vastly exceeds
the implementation and administrative costs, resulting in signifi-
cant deficit reduction.

the bill prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE AND RELATED
BUDGETARY COMPARISONS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives and section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, and pursuant to clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the House
of Representatives, the estimate prepared by the Congressional
Budget Office and submitted pursuant to section 402 of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 is as follows:
The legislation would:
• Increase some employees’ contributions to Federal Employ-
ees’ Retirement System (FERS) and eliminate the retirement
supplement for most employees in the system
• Change the years of salary history used for calculating re-
tirement benefits for most employees to five years from three
years
• Increase pension contributions of new federal hires who
choose not to be at-will employees
• Require eligibility verification for dependents in the Fed-
eral Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, expand
fraud assessments of the program, and deny or disenroll ineli-
gible dependents
• Impose private-sector mandates by reducing the value of
certain earned benefits
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Increasing revenues from federal employees’ contributions
to FERS
• Reducing federal spending on retirement annuities and an-
nuity supplements
• Verifying FEHB eligibility for dependents and disenrolling
ineligible dependents
Areas of significant uncertainty include:

• Anticipating federal employees’ responses to changes in
FERS contributions and benefits
• Projecting how many new federal workers would choose to
be at-will employees
• Predicting the number and timing of dependents who
would be found ineligible for FEHB
• Projecting reductions in spending generated by
disenrolling ineligible dependents from FEHB
Legislation Summary: H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolu-
tion on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, instructed the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Reform to recommend legisla-
tive changes that would decrease deficits by a specified amount
over the 2025–2034 period. As part of the reconciliation process,
the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ap-
proved legislation on April 30, 2025, that would decrease deficits.
Estimated Federal Cost: In CBO’s estimation, the reconciliation
recommendations of the House Committee on Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform would, on net, decrease deficits by $51.0 billion
over the 2025–2034 period. The estimated budgetary effects of the
legislation are shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation mainly
fall within budget functions 550 (health), 600 (income security), 800
(general government), and 950 (undistributed offsetting receipts).

Basis of Estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the leg-
islation will be enacted in summer 2025. CBO’s estimates are rel-
ative to its January 2025 baseline and cover the period from 2025
through 2034.
Direct Spending and Revenues: CBO estimates that enacting the
legislation would decrease direct spending by $11.7 billion and in-
crease revenues by $39.2 billion over the 2025–2034 period; the def-
icit would be reduced $51.0 billion over the 2025–2034 period (see
Table 2).
Increase in FERS Employee Contribution Requirements: The fed-
eral government provides most of its civilian employees a defined
benefit retirement plan through the Federal Employees’ Retirement
System (FERS). The plan provides eligible retirees with a monthly
benefit in the form of an annuity. Those benefits are funded jointly
by contributions from employees and their employing federal agen-
cies. Contribution rates, benefit formulas, and qualification criteria
vary across different categories of employees.
Section 90001 would raise the required contribution rates for cer-
tain groups of people who entered FERS before January 1, 2014;
specifically, most federal employees, Members of Congress, and
Congressional staff.
FERS contributions would not change for federal employees who
are both eligible for enhanced retirement benefits and subject to
mandatory retirement, specifically federal law enforcement officers
and firefighters, Customs and Border Protection officers, members
of the U.S. Capitol Police and the Supreme Court Police, air traffic
controllers, and nuclear materials couriers. (Enhanced benefits are
calculated using a higher percentage of federal salary—1.7 per-
cent—for the first 20 years of service compared with the regular
benefits that generally use 1 percent.) FERS contributions also
would not change for people who entered FERS after 2013 (those
employees are referred to as FERS Further Revised Annuity Em-
ployees).
Under current law, most regular federal employees who entered
FERS before January 2013 contribute 0.8 percent of their annual
salary toward retirement; most who entered FERS during 2013, re-
ferred to as FERS Revised Annuity Employees, contribute 3.1 per-
cent (see Table 3). The proposed higher contribution rates for af-
fected employees would be phased in over two years, beginning in
January 2026.
By the end of the phase-in period (2027), most employees who en-
tered FERS before January 1, 2014, would contribute 4.4 percent
of their annual salary. The contributions of FERS recipients who
are eligible for enhanced benefits and also subject to mandatory re-
tirement would remain unchanged at 1.3 percent. Members of Con-
gress and Congressional staff who entered FERS before 2013 are
eligible for enhanced benefits; their contributions would rise from
1.3 percent to 4.9 percent over the phase-in period. Members and
staff who entered FERS after January 1, 2013, are not eligible for
enhanced benefits.

FERS = Federal Employees’ Retirement System; FRAE = Further Revised Annuity Employees; RAE = Revised Annuity Employees.
The rate for most federal employees, Members of Congress, and
Congressional staff who entered the system in 2013 would increase
from 3.1 percent to 4.4 percent over the phase-in period. Contribu-
tions would remain constant at 3.6 percent for employees who en-
tered in 2013 who are eligible for enhanced benefits and also sub-
ject to mandatory retirement. The contributions for FERS Further
Revised Annuity Employees (those who entered after 2013) would
remain constant at 4.4 percent of their annual salary over the
phase-in period for most federal employees, Members of Congress,
and Congressional staff and at 4.9 percent for employees who are
eligible to receive enhanced benefits.
Contributions paid by federal employees toward their retirement
are recorded as revenues in the federal budget. CBO estimates that
the proposed increases in employee contributions would increase
revenues by $34.5 billion over the 2025–2034 period.
Federal agencies also contribute to their employees’ retirement.
For each increase proposed for employees, there would be a cor-
responding reduction for employing agencies. Reducing employers’
contributions for FERS employees (other than employees of the
Postal Service, USPS) would reduce spending subject to appropria-
tion by $31.8 billion over the 2025–2034 period, CBO estimates.
That, in turn, would reduce the intragovernmental offsetting re-
ceipts paid into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund
(CSRDF) by an equal amount. Because that budgetary action is
contingent on future appropriations, the increase in the deficit from
the decline in estimated offsetting receipts is not attributed to this
legislation.
By contrast, outlays by USPS are classified as off-budget direct
spending. Reducing that agency’s contributions to employee retire-
ment would result in smaller intragovernmental offsetting receipts
being paid into the CSRDF, therefore increasing on-budget direct
spending by that same amount.
Under section 90001, the total amount of retirement contribu-
tions (employee plus agency shares) paid into the CSRDF would re-
main the same as under current law. That is, the legislation would
replace some of the payments by agencies with payments by federal
employees. CBO attributes budgetary savings to the proposal be-
cause employees’ contributions are classified in the budget as reve-
nues, whereas agency payments are classified as

intragovernmental transfers that are subject to future appropria-
tion. If the reduction in intragovernmental transfers makes pos-
sible an offsetting increase in other appropriations, the net effect
would be an increase in outlays—because an intragovernmental
payment would be replaced by spending that goes outside the gov-
ernment.
CBO estimates that reducing the USPS contribution rate for af-
fected employees would reduce that agency’s required payments to
the CSRDF by nearly $2.7 billion over the 2025–2034 period. That
reduction of receipts into the fund would result in a nearly $2.7 bil-
lion increase in on-budget direct spending over the period. Because
CBO projects that USPS will exhaust both its borrowing authority
and its reserve funds in 2027, any savings to the Postal Service
Fund from lower retirement contributions would be fully offset be-
ginning in that year. As a result, CBO estimates that enacting the
provision would result in a reduction in off-budget outlays in 2026
that would be offset by increased off-budget direct spending begin-
ning in 2027 as USPS would spend the amount it saved from lower
accrual payments to fund its operations.
Elimination of FERS Annuity Supplement: Under current law,
certain FERS employees who retire before age 62 receive a supple-
ment to their annuity that is intended to equal the amount they
would receive from the Social Security Administration if they were
eligible for Social Security benefits at the time of retirement. The
annuity supplement ends when the retiree turns 62 or becomes eli-
gible to receive Social Security benefits.
Section 90002 would eliminate the annuity supplement for most
newly retired people under FERS. Employees who retire under a
mandatory authority would continue to receive the supplement as
under current law. Current FERS annuitants and those who retire
before enactment also would continue to receive the supplement.
Using data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),
CBO estimates that about 21,000 new FERS retirees who do not
retire under a mandatory authority are added to the annuity sup-
plement rolls each year. In fiscal year 2025, the average annual
supplement for affected annuitants would be about $18,000, CBO
estimates. Those annuitants begin to receive the supplement, on
average, at age 59 and would therefore receive the supplement for
about three years. On that basis, CBO estimates that eliminating
the supplement for new annuitants would reduce direct spending
by $10.0 billion over the 2025–2034 period.
High-5 Average Pay for Calculating CSRS and FERS Pension:
Most federal employees hired before 1987 are part of the Civil
Service Retirement System (CSRS), the defined benefit pension
plan that was replaced by FERS. Under current law, retirement
annuities under both systems are based on a participant’s average
salary over the three consecutive years with their highest earnings.
Section 90003 would change the annuity calculation to use a five-
year average for most CSRS and FERS employees who retire on or
after January 1, 2027. The annuity calculation for employees who
are subject to mandatory retirement would remain at the three-
year average, as under current law.
Using data from OPM, CBO estimates that about 90,000 employ-
ees who are not subject to mandatory retirement are added to the

CSRS and FERS retirement rolls each year. Under current law, the
average monthly benefit for CSRS annuitants was about $5,700 in
fiscal year 2024; for FERS the average was about $2,300. Using the
five-year average, rather than the three-year average, would reduce
an affected retiree’s annuity by about 3 percent. CBO estimates
that enacting section 90003 would reduce direct spending by $3.1
billion over the 2025–2034 period.
Election for At-Will Employment and Lower FERS Contributions
for New Federal Civil Service Hires: Section 90004 would require
most new federal civilian hires to choose either to serve as at-will
employees or to contribute an additional five percent of their salary
toward their retirement. The change would apply to employees
hired or appointed after enactment. It would not apply to employ-
ees who cannot appeal adverse actions to the Merit Systems Pro-
tection Board, including most USPS employees. It also would ex-
clude certain other employees, including positions excepted from
the competitive service due to the confidential, policy focused na-
ture of their work.
At-will employees can have their employment terminated at any
time without cause. Those employees retain protection under anti-
discrimination laws, however, including laws that prohibit termi-
nation on the basis of race, sex, or religion. Under this provision,
new hires who choose not to become at-will employees would retain
civil service protections that require employers to show cause for
any adverse personnel action and would retain the right to appeal
employment termination.
Based on data from OPM, CBO estimates that roughly 124,000
affected federal hires will enter FERS in fiscal year 2026 with an
annual salary of about $71,000, on average. Using data about em-
ployees’ perceptions of job security and willingness to forgo current
compensation for future benefits, CBO estimates that roughly one
quarter of affected federal hires would choose to contribute an addi-
tional 5 percent of their salary toward retirement rather than enter
into at-will employment. On that basis, CBO estimates that the
larger retirement contributions of those who reject at-will employ-
ment would increase revenues by $4.7 billion over the 2025–2034
period.
Federal agencies also are required to contribute toward employ-
ees’ retirement. Under section 90004, agencies’ contributions would
decrease by the same percentage that employees’ contributions rise.
CBO estimates that reduced employer contributions for FERS em-
ployees in agencies other than USPS would decrease spending sub-
ject to appropriation by $4.5 billion over the 2025–2034 period.
CBO estimates that section 90004 would apply to roughly 10 per-
cent of USPS employees. A reduction in USPS’s contributions for
affected hires who do not choose at-will employment would reduce
that agency’s required payments to the CSRDF (as well as receipts
into the fund) by $112 million over the 2025–2034 period, CBO es-
timates, thereby boosting on-budget direct spending by that
amount. Because CBO projects that USPS will exhaust both its
borrowing authority and its reserve funds in 2027, any savings to
the Postal Service Fund would be fully offset beginning in that
year. Thus, CBO estimates no net change in off-budget outlays by
USPS over the 2025–2034 period.

Filing Fee for Merit Systems Protection Board Claims and Ap-
peals: Section 90005 would direct the Merit Systems Protection
Board (MSPB) to impose fees for employees, former employees, or
applicants for employment to file certain types of claims against
federal agencies. Fees collected from claimants whose appeals are
denied would be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous re-
ceipts. CBO expects that under this provision fewer claims would
be filed than the 4,000 that are filed annually, on average, under
current law. Using information from the MSPB, CBO estimates
that enacting the provision would increase revenues by $3 million
over the 2025–2034 period.
FEHB Protection: Section 90006 would require federal agencies
to verify the eligibility of enrollees’ dependents to participate in the
FEHB program. That program provides health insurance to about
8 million federal workers and annuitants, including current and re-
tired USPS employees, and coverage for their dependents and sur-
vivors. Verification would occur when the employee or annuitant
starts or changes a dependent’s enrollment—for example, during
open season, because of a change in employment, or in response to
a qualifying life event, such as a marriage or the birth or adoption
of a child. Within six years of enactment, the legislation would re-
quire OPM to conduct a verification audit of all dependents en-
rolled in the program. Dependents found to be ineligible would be
denied enrollment or disenrolled. The legislation also would expand
OPM’s annual assessment of fraud risk to include a risk assess-
ment for enrollment by ineligible dependents.
Agencies currently verify dependents’ eligibility at initial enroll-
ment or when employees change their coverage at the time of a
qualifying life event. OPM requires federal agencies to verify 10
percent of enrollment elections during open season. However, the
Government Accountability Office has indicated that some ineli-
gible dependents have been enrolled and that additional measures
could be taken to reduce fraud in the program.1
Over the 2026–2034 period, the legislation would authorize OPM
to spend $604 million from the FEHB trust fund to expand that
agency’s oversight of the program, increasing outlays by the same
amount. Authorized amounts would be for the following activities:
• $474 million to develop, maintain, and conduct ongoing
verifications for and oversight of the FEHB program’s enroll-
ment and eligibility systems;
• $80 million to audit enrollment of dependents; and
• $50 million for program oversight by OPM’s Office of the
Inspector General.
Those amounts would be used in part for activities that would re-
duce enrollment in FEHB and result in smaller government con-
tributions to premiums. CBO anticipates that OPM would imple-
ment the section’s auditing requirements using contracts with pri-
vate-sector entities. Given the likely duration and complexity of
such an undertaking, CBO expects that the audit would begin later
in fiscal year 2026 and continue through 2031.

Using data on the composition of enrollment in the FEHB pro-
gram, along with information about the share of dependents re-
moved as a result of other verification audits, CBO expects that im-
plementing the section would cause enrollment to decline by about
100,000 people, on average, in each year over the 2026–2034 pe-
riod, of which about 10,000 would be removed as a result of open-
season verifications.
Government contributions to premiums for federal annuitants
and USPS employees are classified in the budget as direct spend-
ing. Therefore, a decline in FEHB enrollment among those groups
would reduce direct spending. CBO estimates that about 35 percent
of the people disenrolled would be ineligible dependents of federal
annuitants and USPS employees, at an average annual cost of
about $6,900 per dependent, for a total reduction in direct spending
of $2.1 billion over the 2026–2034 period.2
In total, CBO estimates enacting the section would reduce direct
spending by about $1.5 billion over the 2026–2034 period.
Uncertainty: CBO’s estimates for the budgetary effects of enact-
ing title IX are subject to uncertainty. Several areas in particular
are difficult to estimate:
• Anticipating federal employees’ responses to changes in FERS
contributions and benefits is uncertain because decisions related to
employment and retirement depend on a wide variety of individual
circumstances.
• Estimating new federal employees’ responses to a requirement
to contribute a larger percentage of their salary toward their retire-
ment or accept at-will employment is subject to significant uncer-
tainty due to limited data and historical experience related to how
workers have responded in similar situations.
• Estimating the budgetary effects of section 90006 is subject to
significant uncertainty because no similar verification audit of the
FEHB program has been undertaken. CBO projected the cost of an
audit, length of time required to complete an audit, the number of
dependents who could be found ineligible, and the number
disenrolled, but actual amounts could be larger or smaller than es-
timated. Moreover, given the inherent uncertainty concerning pat-
terns of health care use by people who would be newly found ineli-
gible, the reductions in spending that would be generated by an
audit also could be larger or smaller than estimated here.
Pay-As-You-Go Considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-
you-go procedures are shown in Table 1. Only on-budget changes
to outlays or revenues are subject to pay-as-you-go procedures.
Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits: CBO
estimates that enacting the legislation would not increase net di-
rect spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive
10-year periods beginning in 2035.
Mandates: The Committee on Oversight and Government Re-
form’s reconciliation recommendations would impose private-sector
2By contrast, spending for federal employees is classified as spending subject to appropriation
and contingent on subsequent appropriations; therefore, any reductions in spending for that pop-
ulation are excluded here.

mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA) by reducing the value of certain earned benefits for cur-
rent federal employees. Specifically, the legislation would impose
mandates by eliminating the FERS annuity supplement for most
federal employees and by calculating most future retirees’ annu-
ities using their average highest five years of earnings rather than
the three-year average specified under current law.
In general, changes to the conditions of federal employment are
not mandates because federal employment is voluntary. However,
CBO considers provisions that reduce the value of a benefit that is
already earned to impose a mandate because the change is retro-
active, and affected employees lack the opportunity to make an al-
ternative choice.
The cost of the mandates would be the loss of the annuity sup-
plement and the reduction in the value of current federal employ-
ees’ retirement annuities. CBO estimates that the average annual
cost in the first five years that the mandates are in effect would
be $750 million, which would exceed the annual private-sector
threshold established in UMRA ($206 million in 2025, adjusted an-
nually for inflation).
The legislation would not impose any intergovernmental man-
dates as defined in UMRA.
Other provisions within the legislation, including the increase in
required retirement contributions by current federal employees, are
prospective and do not decrease the value of any earned benefits.
Therefore, those provisions do not impose mandates.

MINORITY VIEWS
Congressional Republicans have instructed the Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform to target our federal workforce
with approximately $50 billion in funding cuts—regardless of their
impact on hard-working federal employees and the critical services
they provide to the American people. In just 100 days, we have wit-
nessed this administration: lay off more than 200,000 probationary
employees—including leading public health experts, veterans, and
other critical positions; coerce 75,000 civil servants into resigning;
replace 50,000 non-partisan civil servants with political appointees;
and illegally terminate non-partisan, independent oversight by fed-
eral watchdogs. This partisan bill threatens to further undermine
the federal workforce—by reducing the take-home pay, benefits,
and workforce protections of 2.4 million federal employees, most of
whom are middle-class American workers and a third of whom are
military veterans. This is more of the same—an unprecedented as-
sault and political purge of the civil service.
If this legislation becomes law, almost every federal employee
hired before 2013 under the federal employee retirement system, or
FERS, would see a nearly 4% pay cut under the bill’s new, forced
retirement contributions.
The FERS annuity supplement, a monthly payment for retirees
before they are eligible for social security age at 62, would be elimi-
nated for anyone not actively receiving the supplemental payment
at the time this bill is enacted, or who does not meet a specific ex-
emption. Federal workers like letter carriers, Veterans Affairs hos-
pital nurses, and food inspectors who have committed decades to
the job and are eligible to retire would not be able to receive this
vital payment to make ends meet.
This legislation would also change the annuity formula to base
most employees’ annual retirement payments on their highest five
years of earnings, instead of the highest three—an outright theft
of earned benefits that would cost federal retirees thousands of dol-
lars annually.
A particularly egregious provision in this bill would force any
newly hired federal employee to accept at-will employment status
or face an additional 5% retirement contribution on top of the 4.4%
already required. Firefighters, Capitol Police officers, air traffic
controllers and other federal workers who choose to remain under
the merit-based system would be forced to contribute nearly 10%
of their paycheck toward retirement.
This legislation would also require current and former federal
employees to pay a $350 filing fee for most appeals before the
Merit Systems Protection Board—which would create a financial
barrier for employees seeking justice, particularly for low-income or
recently separated workers.

A strong, non-partisan federal workforce is fundamental to a
functioning democratic government. These dedicated workers de-
serve our respect and support. Despite the claims of this adminis-
tration, federal workers are not leeches on the system but hard-
working, dedicated public servants who are paid about 25% less
than their private sector counterparts. The Committee Print ad-
vanced by the majority breaks the contract the federal government
made with its workers when they were hired by imposing new, on-
erous, and costly conditions on their annuities.
Like most Americans, federal workers face increased costs for
groceries and housing—and economic uncertainty because of Presi-
dent Trump’s reckless tax and tariff agenda. The Trump tariffs are
estimated to cost American households $4,900 per year—the larg-
est tax increase since 1968. Republicans are also advocating for a
tax regime that will actually increase the federal deficit by more
than $5 trillion.
Worst of all, Republicans are seeking to offset these costs by gut-
ting $800 billion from the Medicaid program. My Democratic col-
leagues and I do not support that. Oversight Democrats stand with
struggling families, we oppose corruption and abuse of power, and
we are committed to solving our nation’s crises without sacrificing
the well-being of our country’s civil servants.
The majority was gravely mistaken to support this legislation
and should instead work towards a budget that respects American
workers and the vital services they provide.

Ranking Member.

TRANSMITTAL OF THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRA-
STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE
BUDGET PURSUANT TO H. CON. RES. 14, CONCURRENT RESOLU-
TION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2025
The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure was in-
structed to submit changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce
the deficit by at least $10 billion for the period of fiscal years 2025
through 2034 in a Committee Print providing for reconciliation pur-
suant to H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Budget for Fiscal Year
2025.
BACKGROUND
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, provides recommenda-
tions to the Committee on Budget that reduce the deficit by at
least $10 billion over the next decade, while making necessary in-
vestments in border security, national security, and aviation safety.
Further, the T&I Committee Print, as amended, provides a historic
investment of $21.2 billion to recapitalize assets of the United
States Coast Guard (Coast Guard or Service), including the acquisi-
tion of cutters, aircraft, and icebreakers and the construction of fa-
cilities necessary to support the President’s maritime border secu-
rity initiatives and national security priorities. Additionally, the
T&I Committee Print, as amended, responds to the recent aviation

accidents and the President’s call to action by investing $12.5 bil-
lion as a down payment on efforts to overhaul and modernize fail-
ing air traffic control systems and to ensure robust air traffic con-
troller staffing and training.
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, assesses a $250 annual
registration fee on electric vehicles (EVs) and a $100 annual fee on
hybrids. These fees will be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund
(HTF), continuing the user-pays principle of the trust fund. Ensur-
ing EVs pay into the HTF will help address solvency and reduce
the need for future bailouts of the trust fund by all taxpayers. Fi-
nally, the T&I Committee Print, as amended, also rescinds waste-
ful spending for Inflation Reduction Act programs, increases ton-
nage duties from current 1909 levels to 2006 levels, establishes a
website to display motor carrier compliance with Federal operating
requirements, and provides $257 million to the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts.
Coast Guard Assets Necessary to Secure the Maritime Border and
Interdict Migrants and Drugs
United States Coast Guard
The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard or Service) was es-
tablished on January 28, 1915, through the consolidation of the
Revenue Cutter Service (established in 1790) and the Lifesaving
Service (established in 1848).1 The Coast Guard later assumed the
duties of three other agencies: the Lighthouse Service (established
in 1789), the Steamboat Inspection Service (established in 1838),
and the Bureau of Navigation (established in 1884).2
The Coast Guard supports critical maritime border security and
national defense missions. Among the Service’s primary duties
under section 102 of title 14, United States Code, the Coast Guard
has responsibility to enforce or assist in the enforcement of all ap-
plicable Federal laws on, under, and over the high seas and waters
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, including engaging
in maritime air surveillance and interdiction; to carry out domestic
and international icebreaking activities; and, as one of the six
armed forces of the United States, to maintain defense readiness
and operate as a specialized service in the Navy upon the declara-
tion of war or when the President directs.3
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, the Coast Guard interdicted 3,687 out
of the 14,211 known maritime illegal immigrants (25.8 percent).
The Coast Guard was responsible for 72 percent of maritime inter-
dictions completed by Federal Government agencies in FY 2024.
During the same fiscal year, the Coast Guard removed 106,290.1
kilograms of cocaine and 41,799.1 pounds of marijuana, worth an
estimated $3.24 billion.4
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, appropriates $21.2 bil-
lion for the acquisition of afloat and air assets and to rebuild the
Coast Guard’s crumbling shoreside infrastructure and facilities in

support of the Coast Guard’s maritime border security and national
defense missions.
Investments in the Coast Guard
The Coast Guard endured chronic undercapitalization for dec-
ades—jeopardizing the Service’s ability to carry out its maritime
border security and national defense missions. Recognizing that
many of its assets were nearing the end of their service lives or
were technologically insufficient, in 2007, the Coast Guard ap-
proved a program of record to modernize its surface, air, informa-
tion technology, and shoreside infrastructure, which has subse-
quently been updated.5 Sadly, many of these assets were utilized
well beyond their planned service life since funds to carry out the
recapitalization were not forthcoming. The Coast Guard is more
than 17 years into this recapitalization program and while signifi-
cant progress has been made, heavy icebreakers and medium en-
durance cutters are aging out before they can be replaced. In addi-
tion, one of the Coast Guard’s two rotary wing aircraft is aging out,
and one of its medium-range fixed-wing aircraft is being retired.6
While the Coast Guard has successfully undertaken some of the
steps outlined in its original recapitalization vision, such as the
procurement and deployment of the Fast Response Cutter (FRC),
programs such as the Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPC), Polar Secu-
rity Cutters (PSC), rotary wing aircraft and shoreside infrastruc-
ture remain dangerously behind schedule due to inadequate fund-
ing requests, and equally inadequate appropriations. These short-
comings have created serious capability gaps in the Service’s ability
to field the assets needed to fulfill its mission demands.7
To address these capability gaps, the T&I Committee Print, as
amended, makes significant investments in the Service’s surface
assets. To support the Coast Guard’s counter drug and migrant
missions, the measure appropriates $4.3 billion for OPCs and $1
billion for FRCs. This funding is intended to procure additional
FRCs which have proven to be a reliable workhorse for the Coast
Guard. The funding will also allow for the procurement of nine
OPCs to complete the first two phases of the OPC program of
record.
With substantial national interests in the Arctic and along the
Northern border, there is also a need to recapitalize and expand
the Coast Guard’s icebreaking fleet. The Arctic alone includes one
million square miles of territorial waters and Exclusive Economic
Zone, a $3 billion arctic seafood industry, 90 billion barrels of un-
discovered oil reserves, 30 percent of the world’s undiscovered nat-
ural gas, $1 trillion in rare earth minerals, and increased commer-
cial and tourism activity.8 Additionally, the Coast Guard is respon-

sible for icebreaking missions in the Great Lakes and other domes-
tic locations. Despite the importance of the Coast Guard’s
icebreaking missions, the current operational ocean-going
icebreaking fleet is limited to three vessels and icebreakers along
the Great Lakes and the Northeast are approaching or beyond
their service life.9
To support the Service’s national security measures, project sov-
ereignty in the Arctic, and ensure the flow of maritime commerce
in territorial waters, the measure provides $4.3 billion for the Polar
Security Cutter Program as well as nearly $5 billion for the Arctic
Security Cutter Program and domestic icebreakers. The funding for
domestic icebreakers is intended to support procurement, project
management, and spare parts for light and medium domestic ice-
breakers, as well as one heavy domestic icebreaker at least as ca-
pable as the Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw (WLBB–30), utilizing
existing designs to the greatest extent possible, and missionization
of the USCGC STORIS, WAGB–21.
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, also makes significant
investments in the Service’s air assets. The measure provides
$571.5 million for fixed wing assets, $1.283 billion for rotary wing
assets, and $140 million for long-range unmanned aircraft systems.
The fixed wing funding is intended to support the acquisition of
three new, fully missionized HC–130J aircraft to complete the
Service’s program of record of 22 aircraft. Funding for rotary wing
assets is intended to support fleet growth of the MH–60T program.
Given the age of the MH–65 aircraft, the Committee recognizes the
challenges of their continued operations over the long-term and
even the medium term. However, the Committee continues to have
significant concerns with the prospect of the Coast Guard moving
to an MH–60 only fleet, as the aircraft is not well suited to cover
several Coast Guard missions. The Committee strongly urges the
Service to continue to examine solutions to maintain a fleet of
smaller rotary wing aircraft that are well suited to undertake the
MH–65s missions. Moreover, the Committee urges the Coast Guard
to maintain a fleet of not less than 140 rotary wing assets to main-
tain sufficient capabilities and coverage.
The Coast Guard requires enhancements to its shoreside infra-
structure to facilitate new assets and more complex mission sets.
Currently, limitations in existing physical infrastructure have hin-
dered newer platforms from utilizing the full scope of their capa-
bilities. Moreover, due to years of underinvestment, the Coast
Guards’ shoreside infrastructure is in an advanced state of dis-
repair. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that
it will cost at least $7 billion to address the Service’s backlog of
shoreside projects, with half of the Services’ facilities beyond their
intended service life.10 The number is likely higher, as GAO’s esti-
mate does not include 234 projects for which the Coast Guard has
not developed estimates. The Coast Guard notes that based on the
Service’s $24 billion property portfolio, and accounting for the poor
conditions of current property, the Service requires between $500

million to $1 billion annually to meet its shoreside investment
needs.11
To address these capability gaps, the T&I Committee Print, as
amended, appropriates $3.15 billion for the design and construction
of necessary shoreside facilities, including hangers and home ports
to support air and surface assets for which appropriations are pro-
vided in this bill. This includes $400 million to support aircraft
hangers, maintenance and crew facilities, $2.329 billion for
homeports for cutters, including homeporting for the USCGC
STORIS, WAGB–21, and $425 million for the recapitalization of
barracks and a multi-use training center at the Coast Guard’s en-
listed bootcamp.
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, also includes $1.3 billion
to improve the Coast Guard’s depot maintenance facilities, includ-
ing $500 million to be used for construction of a ship handling facil-
ity and necessary dredging at the Coast Guard Yard, to provide the
facility with the capability to provide repairs and maintenance for
the Service’s Offshore Patrol Cutters and National Security Cut-
ters. For over a century, Coast Guard vessels have been built, re-
paired, and renovated in the Yard, which provides a unique capa-
bility to support the Coast Guard and the national fleet.
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, includes $180 million to
support the Coast Guard’s maritime domain awareness activities,
of which $75 million is directed to be spent on autonomous mari-
time systems, and $15 million is intended to improve merchant ma-
rine credentialing software. The Committee supports the Coast
Guard’s continued investments in autonomous maritime domain
awareness assets that strengthen the ability of the Service to con-
front drug and human smugglers, and other threats to the home-
land.
Procurement Requirements and Continued Oversight of the Coast
Guard
The Committee is disappointed by the Coast Guard’s inability to
produce statutorily required acquisition planning documents. Sec-
tion 5102 of Title 14, United States Code, requires the Coast Guard
to submit to Congress an annual five-year Capital Investment Plan
not later than 60 days after the President submits his budget to
Congress.12 The Committee has received neither the Fiscal Year
2024 Capital Investment Plan nor the Fiscal Year 2025 Capital In-
vestment Plan. Additionally, section 5103 of Title 14 United States
Code, requires the Coast Guard to submit a biennial report to the
Committee on the status of the Coast Guard’s major acquisition
programs.13 By the Coast Guard’s own admission, the major acqui-
sition program report was last made available in Fiscal Year 2015
and has not been produced since then because of ‘‘the complexity
and highly speculative nature of projecting long-term resource im-

plications. . . .’’14 The Committee is willing to make the largest in-
vestment in the Coast Guard’s history based on demonstrated need.
The Service’s latest history with major acquisition processes raises
concern, and demands greater oversight from Congress, not less.
Accordingly, the T&I Committee Print, as amended, includes lan-
guage that prohibits the Coast Guard from spending the funding
contained in this bill until certain statutorily required acquisition
reports are delivered to Congress. Similarly, the measure restricts
funding for fixed wing and rotary wing assets until the Service pro-
vides a report detailing the sufficiency of the Coast Guards aviation
assets to meet mission demands.15
The Committee recognizes the need to procure new surface and
air assets as quickly and efficiently as possible. Accordingly, the
Committee waives the requirements of sections 1131, 1132, and
1133 of Title 14, United States Code. Additionally, the Committee
continues to strongly support the domestic maritime industrial
base—both in terms of the economic benefits it brings to our coun-
try and the national security readiness it provides in times of war
or national emergency. The Committee maintains the requirement
of section 1151 of Title 14, United States Code, and mandates addi-
tional notification requirements should the President determine an
exemption from the requirement of that section is necessary. The
Committee also provides authority to use vessel construction man-
agers for procurement of domestic icebreakers, Arctic Security Cut-
ters, and a floating drydock for the Coast Guard Yard. A similar
procurement technique has proven successful in other government
agencies and provides the Service with an additional capability to
expeditiously procure these assets. The Committee does not modify
any additional procurement requirements, and expects the Coast
Guard to comply in good faith with the requirements set by stat-
ute. Additionally, the measure directs the Coast Guard to provide
the Committee with a detailed expenditure plan and notify the
Committee no less than one week prior to taking any procurement
actions impacting estimated costs or timelines for acquisitions or
procurements funded in this bill.
Changes to Mandatory Benefits Programs to Allow Selected Reserve
Orders for Preplanned Missions to Secure Maritime Borders
and Interdict Persons and Drugs
Under current law, the Department of Defense has the authority
to involuntarily activate members of the Selected Reserve for
preplanned missions under Chapter 12304b of Title 10, United
States Code. This extends the same authority to the Commandant
of the Coast Guard.
This authority is necessary to augment the regular Coast Guard
for foreseeable or regularly occurring, non-emergency operations.
These include, but are not limited to, support of the Department
of Defense’s Request for Forces in support of law enforcement oper-
ations, like border security. The absence of this authority has lim-
ited the Coast Guard’s ability to execute preplanned missions be-
cause the Service is forced to rely on volunteer reservists.

Vessel Tonnage Duties
Under current law, regular tonnage taxes are collected from ves-
sels entering from foreign ports. United States flagged vessels, rec-
reational vessels and barges, which are engaged in voyages to no-
where are exempt from these duties.16 The amount of duties col-
lected under current law was temporarily increased for fiscal years
2006 through 2010. The T&I Committee Print, as amended, re-
stores the tonnage taxes on foreign vessels entering from foreign
ports to their previous levels.
Registration Fee on Certain Vehicles
The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) was created in 1956 and has
since served as the chief funding source at the Federal level for
surface transportation funding. The HTF is funded by several user-
fees, with the largest source of revenue being excise taxes on gaso-
line and diesel fuels. Tax rates on gasoline and diesel fuels were
most recently raised in 1993 to 18.4-cents and 24.3-cents per gal-
lon, respectively. The user-fee structure sustained HTF spending
for decades, but expenditures began eclipsing revenues in 2001.
This disparity has ballooned over the years and is attributable to
several factors. For example, vehicle fuel efficiency has improved
and inflation has weakened purchasing power. The prevalence of
electric vehicles, which use no gasoline and therefore do not con-
tribute to the HTF, has also increased in recent years. While these
factors have impacted revenues, Congress has also increased
spending from the HTF. To cover this funding gap, since 2008,
Congress has transferred $275 billion, mainly from the Treasury’s
General Fund. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA;
P.L. 117–58) alone required a $118 billion General Fund transfer,
which represents more than 40 percent of General Fund transfers
to the HTF to date. The Committee recognizes the need to address
the solvency challenges facing the HTF to ensure continued sup-
port for our nation’s surface transportation infrastructure.
To preserve the user-pays model and ensure electric vehicles
begin contributing to the HTF similar to other motorists, the T&I
Committee Print, as amended, requires the Administrator of the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to impose certain annual
motor vehicle registration fees: $250 for an electric vehicle and
$100 for a hybrid vehicle. Fees do not apply to commercial motor
vehicles or covered farm vehicles and are to be indexed annually
for inflation. Intending to leverage existing state systems, fees are
to be collected by state departments of motor vehicles and balances
then remitted to FHWA. No personally identifiable data, including
vehicle ownership information, is intended to be transmitted from
a state to the Federal government for purposes of implementing
this collection mechanism. For any state not in compliance with
these requirements, FHWA will withhold Federal highway formula
funding at an amount equal to 125 percent of the fees that were
required to be remitted.
To support the states, the T&I Committee Print, as amended,
print provides $104 million for implementation of the registration
fee process. States in compliance with the requirements of the T&I

Committee Print, as amended, are permitted to retain up to one

Motor Carrier Data
Under current law, a motor carrier is not authorized to operate
on the Nation’s roadways if that motor carrier has received an un-
satisfactory safety rating via the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Ad-
ministration’s (FMCSA’s) Safety Measurement System (SMS) or
has been ordered to discontinue operations by the FMCSA for addi-
tional violations.17 The T&I Committee Print, as amended, will im-
prove transparency and increase roadway safety by requiring motor
carrier safety rating data is available on a website. A broker,
freight forwarder, or household goods freight forwarder who relies
on the website’s determinations of whether motor carriers have met
FMCSA requirements has made reasonable and prudent deter-
minations when engaging that motor carrier.
IRA Recissions
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, rescinds wasteful spend-
ing for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) programs. The IRA was
passed on a partisan basis, and the Committee rescinded unobli-
gated balances that were supporting the Biden Administration’s
Green New Deal agenda in order to reduce the deficit.
General Services Administration
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, rescinds unobligated
funding for funding included in the IRA provided for the General
Services Administration to convert facilities to high-performance
green buildings, acquire and install low carbon material for the
construction or alteration of federal buildings, and for emerging
and sustainable technologies.
Federal Highway Administration
The T&I Committee Print, as amended, rescinds unobligated
funding for Federal Highway Administration initiatives provided
under the IRA, including the Neighborhood Equity and Access
Grant, Low-Carbon Transportation Materials Grants, and Environ-
mental Review Implementation funds.
Federal Aviation Administration
The T&I Committee print, as amended, rescinds unobligated
funding for the Federal Aviation Administration’s Fueling Avia-

tion’s air navigation service provider and air traffic control (ATC)
system operator, providing safe and efficient navigation and sur-
veillance services for aircraft operators such as major airlines, busi-
ness aviation, general aviation, the military, and other users of the
NAS. FAA’s Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is responsible for oper-
ating the ATC system, which includes maintaining the technical
and physical infrastructure necessary to operate the NAS, and em-
ploying and training highly skilled workers to ensure the proper
and safe functioning of the NAS.18 Approximately 14,000 air traffic
controllers, 4,100 air traffic supervisors and air traffic managers,
2,200 engineers, and 5,800 maintenance technicians make up
ATO’s workforce.19
Much of the FAA’s air traffic infrastructure is several decades
old, which decreases efficiency and jeopardizes the reliability of
critical navigation and surveillance services provided to aircraft op-
erating in the NAS.20 The challenges with the FAA’s efforts to
swiftly modernize ATC programs remain a serious concern for the
Committee and poses a critical risk to the safety of the NAS if left
unaddressed.21 For decades, GAO and others have reported the on-
going challenges facing the FAA’s modernization of ATC systems.22
As early as 1995, GAO designated the FAA’s ATC modernization
efforts as ‘‘high-risk’’ due to the many delays and cost overruns the
agency has encountered.23 More recently, the GAO found that
these challenges are also due to the unavailability of parts, reduced
technical expertise in outdated technologies, growth in airspace de-
mand, among other factors.24 Although the FAA has acknowledged
these gaps and are working to establish greater accountability with
its investments,25 more must be done to improve the safety and ef-
ficiency of the NAS. For these reasons, the T&I Committee print,
as amended, appropriates $12.5 billion for the acquisition,
sustainment, improvement, and operations of FAA facilities and
equipment necessary to improve or maintain aviation safety. This
sum also covers personnel expenses related to such facilities and
equipment, including for airway transportation system specialists
necessary to safely integrate new facilities, equipment, and systems
into the NAS.
ATC Infrastructure
The ATC system’s physical infrastructure system serves as the
backbone of the NAS and is the most visible element of the system.

From FAA facilities, air traffic controllers provide air traffic serv-
ices to approximately 45,000 flights each day carrying 2.9 million
passengers and assist roughly 5,400 aircraft at any given time dur-
ing peak operational hours.26 ATC services are provided to opera-
tors 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The age and poor physical
condition of many of these facilities and equipment introduce un-
necessary risk into the NAS.27 Some major types of ATC facilities
include the following:
• Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facili-
ties. Radar approach control facilities that provide separation
services for aircraft operating in terminal areas, the airspace
generally located within 40 miles of a major airport. In FY
2023, there were 146 TRACON facilities of various configura-
tions.28
• Airport traffic control towers. These towers direct air-
craft on the airport surface, as well as landings and take-offs
at airports. In FY 2023, the FAA operated 142 stand-alone
towers.29
• Federal contract towers. Federal contractors, rather
than FAA employees, provide air traffic control services at vis-
ual flight rule airports. FAA oversees the safe operation of
these towers. In FY 2023, there were 262 contract towers in
the NAS.30
• Combined control facilities (CCF). These air traffic
control facilities provide approach control services for one or
more airports, as well as en-route air traffic control for a large
area of airspace. In FY 2023, there were four CCFs in the
NAS.31
According to the FAA, the average age of air traffic control tower
is 40 years and the average age of a TRACON facility is 27 years.32
The condition of these facilities continues to worsen with age and
they are in critical need of replacement.33 However, funding levels
over the past decade have failed to sustain the pace necessary to
support these facilities.34 With a finite capital budget and unstable
funding, the FAA is forced into the impossible predicament of hav-
ing to dedicate vast amounts of money on simply sustaining old
and outdated systems with little left over for capital improvement
projects. Therefore, the T&I Committee print, as amended, appro-
priates $2.16 billion for air traffic control tower and TRACON re-
placement.
Air traffic controllers in these facilities use a suite of technical
operating systems to monitor weather, conduct navigation and sur-
veillance, and communicate with aircraft in the NAS. However,
many of these systems are obsolete and much of the infrastructure

has well exceeded its expected service life. In a GAO report last
year, the FAA determined that, of its 138 ATC systems, 51 were
unsustainable and 54 were potentially unsustainable.35 Addition-
ally, GAO identified 17 systems that were ‘‘especially concerning’’
given they are both ‘‘unsustainable’’ and ‘‘critical to the safety and
efficiency of the national airspace’’ and that their replacement sys-
tems ‘‘will not be completed for at least [six] more years and in
some cases, they will not be completed for 10 to 13 years.’’36 Many
aviation stakeholders have expressed concerns with these findings
given that these systems comprise the suite of complex technical
systems that enable air traffic controllers to safely monitor and
control the separation of aircraft in the NAS.37
Specifically, the FAA owns and operates a vast network of 618
radar systems necessary for the safety and security of our air-
space.38 There are two main types of radar systems: ‘‘cooperative
radars’’ which identify and track aircraft with the help of on-board
aircraft transponders, and ‘‘non-cooperative radars’’ which identify
and track and aircraft’s position independently.39 These radars are
essential tools used by air traffic controllers to detect and monitor
aircraft, and the NAS cannot operate without them.40 However,
several of these radar systems are approaching 36 years of age and
are experiencing structural deficiencies and maintenance-related
issues, resulting in more frequent repairs and periods when the
system is not operational.41 Modernizing these systems will in-
crease the safety and efficiency of the NAS, which is why the T&I
Committee print, as amended, appropriates $3 billion for radar sys-
tems replacement.
Furthermore, the FAA maintains mission critical telecommuni-
cations infrastructure necessary for voice, radar, and flight data
communications for air traffic control operations.42 However, the
current telecommunications system is comprised of obsolete copper
wire infrastructure that is costly to maintain, prone to network
failures, and no longer supported by common service providers.43
The Committee is concerned that the FAA is obligated to pay over
$100 million a month in obsolescence fees to service providers to
maintain the old system.44 Therefore, the Committee believes a
substantial investment in telecommunications infrastructure re-
placement is necessary to promote valuable use of taxpayer dollars
and provide the FAA the resources necessary to upgrade this mis-
sion critical system. For this reason, the T&I Committee print, as

Runway Safety
In the past several years, there have been an alarming number
of near misses at airports. Most notably, on February 4, 2023, a
FedEx flight inbound to Austin Bergstrom International Airport
(AUS) in Austin, TX, and almost landed on top of a Southwest
flight, with 128 passengers and crew onboard, taking off from the
same runway. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) re-
port noted the aircraft came within 150 to 170 feet of each other
during this incident and attributed the near miss to dense fog and
a lack of surface detection equipment that could have alerted the
air traffic controller in the tower to a potential collision.45
In recognition of the increase in near misses, the Committee in-
cluded section 347 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which
requires the FAA to identify and deploy surface surveillance and
detection systems and technologies at all medium and large hub
airports, and airports that do not have such technologies.46 Fur-
thermore, section 347 requires the FAA to conduct a study of run-
way incursions and other surface safety events to determine how
advanced technologies may be able to reduce the frequencies of
such events.47 The Committee continues to remain concerned about
the potential for future near misses. Therefore, the T&I Committee
print, as amended, appropriates $500 million for runway safety
projects, airport surface surveillance projects, and to carry out sec-
tion 347.
Alaska Aviation Safety
Aviation in Alaska is a vital necessity given that 82 percent of
Alaskan communities are inaccessible by road.48 However, aviation
operators in Alaska face unique challenges compared to operators
in the contiguous states, due in large part to the state’s challenging
geography, unpredictable weather, and relative lack of aviation and
air traffic control infrastructure. The Committee recognizes the
challenges unique to Alaska aviation and included section 342,
which establishes the Don Young Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative
(DYAASI) in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.49 The objective
of DYAASI is to reduce the number of fatal accidents in Alaska and
the territories by 90 percent from 2019 to 2033 and eliminate fatal
accidents for Part 135 operations by 2033. To realize these objec-
tives, DYASSI requires the FAA to install reliable automated
weather systems at certain airports, install and continually assess
the state of weather cameras, and implement certain NTSB rec-
ommendations, among other provisions.50 The Committee recog-
nizes the substantial resources necessary to achieve these objec-

NextGen
To meet an anticipated growth in air traffic, in 2007 the FAA
launched a series of initiatives to revamp the Nation’s ATC system
known as ‘‘NextGen.’’51 The goal of NextGen is to transition from
ground-based navigation and surveillance systems to a satellite-
based system to increase the efficiency, capacity, and flexibility of
our airspace. Specifically, NextGen initiatives should reduce the re-
quired separation between aircraft, resulting in more efficient
routes and decrease congestion. Together, these initiatives should
provide better experience for the travelling public.52
The goal at the inception of NextGen was to achieve trans-
formation of the NAS by 2025.53 However, NextGen programs have
been vulnerable to delays and cost-overruns.54 According to a Sep-
tember 2024 GAO report, NextGen activities’ initial completion
dates of 2025 have been delayed to 2030.55 Although anticipated
costs for NextGen programs have fallen back in line with original
estimates, challenges remain for FAA’s continued implementation,
including uncertainty of future funding, unanticipated system re-
quirements, and aircraft owners’ equipage to fully utilize NextGen
improvements, FAA’s leadership stability, and cybersecurity
issues.56
In recognition of the ongoing challenges and delays of the
NextGen program, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 effectively
sunsets the NextGen program57 and requires the FAA to achieve
what the NextGen program could not, closing out key airspace
modernization initiatives that will improve the safety and effi-
ciency of the NAS.58 Specifically, section 619 requires the FAA to
expedite the implementation of the following programs and capa-
bilities previously under the NextGen brand: Performance Based
Navigation, Data Communications, Terminal Flight Data Manager
and Aeronautical Information Management.59 The Committee
views the airspace modernization initiatives as critical to the safety
and efficiency of the NAS. Therefore, the T&I Committee print, as
amended, includes $300 million to carry out Section 619.

ATC Workforce
For many years, the FAA failed to hire and train a sufficient
number of air traffic controllers.60 At the onset of the COVID–19
pandemic, decreased demand for air travel led to the elimination
or reduction of activities at air traffic control facilities, and the hir-
ing goals at ATO for 2021 were reduced to account for decreased
demand.61 Additionally, ATO shuttered the FAA ATC Training
Academy due to the pandemic.62 As demand for air travel dramati-
cally increased post-pandemic, ATO struggled with staffing short-
ages at critical facilities.63
In the 2022 Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, the FAA near-
ly doubled its hiring goals compared to 2021 to match increasing
air travel demand.64 However, the process of hiring and adequately
training an air traffic controller is a lengthy process, often taking
several years to complete.65 While the FAA has sought to increase
staffing numbers in air traffic control centers, its Air Traffic Con-
trol Workforce Plan counts newly hired and untrained air traffic
controllers in its overall workforce numbers, which can give the ap-
pearance that a facility is appropriately staffed when the facility
does not have enough fully trained controllers.66 Unfortunately,
this dynamic creates uncertainty and confusion in the overall air
traffic controller workforce and the FAA’s ability to meet oper-
ational needs. At the end of FY 2024, the FAA had a net gain of
only 34 Certified Professional Controllers (CPCs); which meant
that there were 1,020 fewer CPCs than there were at the end of
FY 2012, a nine percent decrease.67
In the latest Aerospace forecast for the 2024–2044 period, the
FAA noted that ‘‘with robust air travel demand growth in 2024 and
steady growth thereafter, [they] expect increased activity growth
[which] has the potential to increase controller workload.’’68 To di-
rectly address the controller workforce bottleneck in the aviation
system, section 437 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 directs
the FAA to set the minimum hiring target for new air traffic con-
trollers, for each of FYs 2024 through 2028, to the maximum num-
ber of individuals trained at the FAA Air Traffic Control Academy.

Additionally, the Trump Administration and Secretary Duffy
have announced a series of actions to supercharge the controller
workforce.69 These actions include increasing starting salaries for
controller candidates, streamlining the hiring process to improve
efficiency, and expand the number of instructors at the Air Traffic
Controller Academy in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, among other ini-
tiatives.70 The Committee views a healthy and robust certified con-
troller workforce as essential for maintaining aviation safety.
Therefore, the T&I Committee print, as amended, appropriates $1
billion for air traffic controller recruitment, retention, training and
advanced training technologies.
Kennedy Center Appropriations
In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the
National Cultural Center Act establishing a cultural arts center in
Washington, D.C. to present performance arts, lectures, programs
for children, youth, and the elderly as well as provide facilities for
other civic activities.71
In 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Ken-
nedy, President Johnson signed into law legislation renaming the
National Cultural Center as the ‘‘John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts’’, as a ‘‘living memorial’’ to President Kennedy.72
As the national memorial to the late President Kennedy, Congress
provides funding for the Kennedy Center’s buildings and grounds.
However, the Kennedy Center’s programming and other functions
are paid for almost exclusively through ticket sales and dona-
tions.73
The T&I Committee print, as amended, print includes funding
for capital improvements, operations and maintenance and associ-
ated administration costs to address deferred maintenance and up-
keep of the Kennedy Center’s buildings and grounds as a memorial
to the late President Kennedy and to ensure continued proper use
as a performing arts center for the American people as intended by
President Eisenhower. More specifically, this funding would gen-
erally support water system upgrades, office space improvements,
electric enhancements, elevator updates, rigging replacement (sus-
pending lights, cameras, speakers), seating replacement, lighting
and backstage improvements, hydronic system (water heaters)
modernization, and bathroom upgrades, among other items.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of rule XIII, clause 3(c)(6)(A) of the 119th Con-
gress, the Committee held numerous hearings that supported the
proposals included in the T&I Committee print, as amended. Below

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee’s over-
sight findings and recommendations are reflected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under sec-
tion 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely
submitted prior to the filing of the report and is included in the re-
port. Such a cost estimate is included in this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has received the
enclosed cost estimate for the T&I Committee Print, as amended,
from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office:
The bill would:
Appropriate funds for activities of the Coast Guard, the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration (FAA), and the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts
Increase tonnage duties charged to shippers that enter U.S.
ports
Impose annual registration fees on electric and hybrid vehi-
cles and require states to collect and remit those fees
Rescind funds appropriated under Public Law 117–169 for
transportation and federal buildings programs
Impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:

Expending funds appropriated for Coast Guard, FAA, and
other activities
Increasing tonnage duties
Collecting fees on electric and hybrid vehicles remitted by
states
Rescinding funds for transportation and federal buildings
programs
Areas of significant uncertainty include:
Anticipating the volume of goods imported into the U.S., tar-
iff rates, and other factors that affect tonnage fees
Estimating the number of electric and hybrid vehicles that
will be registered and the rates at which states remit the
motor vehicle fees required under the bill
Legislation summary: H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution
on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, instructed the House Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure to recommend legisla-
tive changes that would decrease deficits by a specific amount over
the 2025–2034 period. As part of the reconciliation process, the
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure approved
legislation on April 30, 2025, with provisions that would decrease
deficits.
Estimated Federal cost: In CBO’s estimation, the reconciliation
recommendations of the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure would decrease deficits by $36.6 billion over the
2025–2034 period. The estimated budgetary effects of the legisla-
tion are shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within
budget functions 400 (transportation), 500 (education, training, em-
ployment, and social services), 700 (veterans benefits and services),
and 800 (general government).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legis-
lation will be enacted in summer 2025. CBO’s estimates are rel-
ative to its January 2025 baseline and cover the period from 2025
through 2034. Outlays of appropriated amounts were estimated
using historical obligation and spending rates for similar programs.
CBO’s estimate incorporates administrative and judicial action as
of April 10, 2025, the date that H. Con. Res. 14 was approved by
the Congress.
Direct spending: Enacting the bill would increase direct spending
by $27.8 billion over the 2025–2034 period (see Table 2), CBO esti-
mates. Most of that amount would result from specified direct ap-
propriations for activities of the Coast Guard and the Federal Avia-
tion Administration (FAA), offset by a reduction in direct spending
from funds rescinded from transportation projects and programs in-
volving federal buildings.
Coast Guard Assets Necessary to Secure the Maritime Border
and Interdict Migrants and Drugs: Section 100001 would appro-
priate $21.2 billion for the Coast Guard to acquire, procure, and
improve equipment and facilities, as follows:
$14.6 billion for vessels, including offshore patrol cutters,
polar security cutters, and arctic security cutters;
$3.2 billion for shoreside infrastructure;
$2.0 billion for aircraft; and
$1.5 billion for other activities, including $500 million to ac-
quire, procure, or construct a floating dry dock at the Coast
Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland.
Based on historical spending patterns for similar projects, and
using information from the Coast Guard, CBO estimates that en-
acting section 100001 would increase outlays by $19.6 billion over
the 2025–2034 period.
Changes to Mandatory Benefits Programs to Allow Selected Re-
serve Orders for Preplanned Missions to Secure Maritime Borders
and Interdict Persons and Drugs: Section 100002 would authorize
the Coast Guard to place members of the Selected Reserve on ac-
tive duty under certain circumstances. That time would count to-
ward the reservists’ entitlement for benefits under the Post-9/11 GI
Bill; those benefits are paid from mandatory appropriations. Ac-
counting for the increased benefits some reservists and their de-
pendents would receive and using information from the Coast
Guard, CBO estimates that each year, 250 reservists, on average,
would accrue about six months of additional active duty that would
be counted toward their eligibility.
Using information from the Department of Veterans Affairs,
CBO estimates that the longer time reservists spend on active duty
would increase direct spending by $9 million over the 2025–2034
period.
Vessel Tonnage Duties: Section 100003 would increase tonnage
duties on vessels entering the United States. Those charges are lev-
ied by Customs and Border Protection and recorded in the budget
as offsetting receipts (that is, as reductions in direct spending). In
general, the bill would increase tonnage duty rates by 125 percent
relative to rates under current law. In 2024, the government col-
lected about $33 million in such charges.

CBO estimates that the higher rate would increase collections
(and reduce direct spending) by about $38 million per year relative
to current law, totaling $343 million over the 2025–2034 period.
Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles: Section 100004 would appro-
priate $104 million in 2026 to support states as they implement
systems for collecting registration fees for electric and hybrid vehi-
cles. Those collections are discussed below in the section on Reve-
nues.
Based on historical spending patterns for similar programs, CBO
estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays by $102
million over the 2025–2034 period.
Motor Carrier Data: Section 100006 would appropriate $5 million
to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to
create a public website for tracking motor carriers’ compliance with
the agency’s operating requirements. The provision also would
allow FMCSA to collect fees from entities that access the website,
which could be spent without further appropriation. Those collec-
tions are discussed below in the section on Revenues.
CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays
by $20 million over the 2025–2034 period, reflecting spending of
the direct appropriation ($5 million) and the collected fees ($15 mil-
lion).
Rescissions: Section 100007 would rescind funds from seven pro-
grams established under the 2022 reconciliation act with the fol-
lowing purposes:
Support development of sustainable aviation fuel;
Support projects to improve walkability, safety, and trans-
portation access in disadvantaged communities;
Convert General Services Administration (GSA) facilities to
high-performing green buildings;
Install low-carbon materials in GSA facilities;
Support use of emerging technologies for environmental pro-
grams in GSA facilities;
Support environmental review for transportation projects;
and
Support development of low-carbon transportation materials.
CBO estimates that enacting this section would reduce budget
authority by $5.2 billion and outlays by $4 billion over the 2025–
2034 period.
Air Traffic Control Staffing and Modernization: Section 100008
would appropriate $12.5 billion for the FAA to construct, acquire,
improve, and operate various facilities and equipment as follows:
$7.8 billion for radar and telecommunications systems;
$2.2 billion for air traffic control facilities;
$1.0 billion for air traffic controller recruitment, retention,
and training; and
$1.6 billion for other activities, including runway safety
projects and unstaffed infrastructure.
Based on historical spending patterns for similar projects and
using information from the FAA, CBO estimates that enacting this
section would increase outlays by $12.0 billion over the 2025–2034
period.
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Appropriations:
Section 100009 would appropriate $257 million for the John F.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, increasing outlays by the
same amount over the 2025–2034 period.
Revenues: Enacting the bill would increase revenues by $64 bil-
lion over the 2025–2034 period (see Table 2). Almost all of that
would be collected in registration fees on electric and hybrid vehi-
cles under section 100004.
Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles: Sections 100004 and 100005
would require states to collect annual registration fees of $250 for
electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles, through September
30, 2035, and to deposit those collections into the Highway Trust
Fund. States would be required to remit 99 percent of the collected
fees to the federal government, retaining up to 1 percent to cover
administrative costs associated with collections. The Federal High-
way Administration would be directed to withhold apportionments
from the Highway Trust Fund for states that do not collect and
remit the fees. Starting in fiscal year 2027, the withheld amount
would be 125 percent of the amount required to be remitted.
CBO expects that states would generally enact the necessary leg-
islative or administrative measures to implement and collect the
required fees within a few years of enactment and would comply
with the remittance requirements. Proceeds from the collections
would be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund; outlays from the
fund are controlled by annual obligation limitations and therefore
are considered discretionary.
Indirect taxes and regulatory fees tend to reduce collections of in-
come and payroll taxes. As a result, CBO expects that the new fee
collections would be partially offset by decreases in tax receipts of
about 25 percent of the gross fee collections each year.74 CBO esti-
mates that enacting sections 100004 and 100005 would increase
revenues, on net, by $64 billion over the 2025–2034 period.
Motor Carrier Data: Section 100006 would authorize FMCSA to
charge an annual fee of $100 for access to a website that would
track motor carriers’ compliance with FMCSA’s operating require-
ments. Under the provision, brokers and similar entities would be
considered to have exercised reasonable and prudent care in engag-
ing motor carriers if they use the website to verify a carrier’s com-
pliance status.
When they are collected by the federal government under its sov-
ereign authority, fees are considered revenues. CBO considers a de-
termination that an entity has acted in a ‘‘reasonable and prudent’’
manner as a matter of law to be an exercise of sovereign authority,
so those access fees would be considered revenues.
Based on expected participation rates, and accounting for the off-
set for indirect taxes, CBO estimates that the collection of access
fees would increase federal revenues, on net, by $12 million over
the 2025–2034 period.
Uncertainty: Many of CBO’s estimates for the budgetary effects
of enacting title X are subject to uncertainty because they rely on
underlying projections and other estimates that are themselves dif-
ficult to estimate.
Several areas in particular are difficult to estimate:

roll Tax Offset in Its Budget Projections and Cost Estimates (October 2022), www.cbo.gov/publi-
cation/58421.

The amounts collected in tonnage duties under section 100003
could vary from CBO’s estimates because the volume of goods im-
ported into the United States is uncertain. CBO also cannot predict
changes in tariffs or certain other factors that would affect the vol-
ume of imported goods.
Revenues collected for registrations of electric and hybrid vehi-
cles under section 100004 could differ from estimated amounts if
states begin to collect fees more quickly or slowly than CBO ex-
pects, or if there are more or fewer registrations than expected
under current law.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-
you-go procedures are shown in Table 1.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting the legislation would not increase net direct
spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-
year periods beginning in 2035.
Mandates: The reconciliation recommendations included in title
X of the legislation would impose intergovernmental and private-
sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(UMRA). CBO estimates that the total cost of those mandates
would exceed the thresholds established in UMRA for intergovern-
mental and private-sector mandates ($103 million and $206 million
in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).
Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Fees: Section 100004 would require
the owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to remit annual registra-
tion fees, which would impose intergovernmental and private-sector
mandates on the owners of those vehicles. The requirement would
include some light-duty vehicles owned by state and local govern-
ments, including schools, universities, and other public entities
that are subject to state registration requirements. The legislation
would exclude some commercial vehicles from the fee.
CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would exceed $10
billion each year once the policy has been fully implemented. The
cost for intergovernmental entities to comply with the mandate
would exceed the threshold starting in 2029 and remain above it
each year through 2034. As a result of the legislation, to avoid pay-
ing the registration fees, some states could choose to modify their
registration requirements for government-owned vehicles.
The section would impose an additional intergovernmental man-
date by requiring states to administer and collect the fees on behalf
of the federal government. States would update their registration
processes unless an alternative is approved by the administrator of
FMCSA. The legislation would provide a onetime grant to states to
implement the policy and allow them to retain a portion of the re-
mittances to cover administrative costs. For states unable to re-
cover credit and debit card fees from vehicle registration remit-
tances, CBO estimates that the requirement would result in a net
loss of several million dollars in revenue each year.
Motor Carriers: Section 100006 would require FMCSA to estab-
lish a website that would provide information to brokers and simi-
lar entities on the status of a motor carrier’s compliance with

FMCSA operational requirements. That provision would impose a
private-sector mandate by limiting the rights of action that peti-
tioners may make against brokers. Currently, when a motor carrier
causes injuries or property damage, a petitioner may challenge
whether the broker exercised due care in selecting the carrier.
Under the legislation, brokers using that site will be considered to
have exercised due care in selecting a motor carrier. The cost of the
mandate would be any monetary damages that would not be
awarded as a result. CBO cannot estimate the cost of the mandate
because it would depend on the outcome of future litigation.
Coast Guard Selected Reserve: Section 100002 would expand the
scope of an existing intergovernmental and private-sector mandate
on employers. That section would extend the employment protec-
tions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act of 1994 to members of the Coast Guard Selected Re-
serve who are placed on active duty. Employers would be required
to treat those reservists as furloughed employees or employees on
a leave of absence, which would entitle them to any compensation
or benefits otherwise available to them in that status. Upon their
return from active duty, employers would be required to provide
them with the same benefits, pay, and seniority as though they had
not been deployed. The cost of the mandate would be the cost to
employers that provide those benefits. CBO expects that each year
the provision would affect 250 reservists, on average. The cost for
public and private employers would be small.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Susan Yeh Beyer (for the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts); Paul B.A. Hol-
land (for veterans’ education programs); Aaron Krupkin (for avia-
tion and maritime programs); Willow Latham-Proenc¸a (for surface
transportation programs); Matthew Pickford (for federal buildings);
Molly Sherlock (for revenues); Mandates: Brandon Lever.
Estimate reviewed by: Elizabeth Cove Delisle, Chief, Income Se-
curity Cost Estimates Unit; Ann E. Futrell, Acting Chief, Natural
and Physical Resources Cost Estimates Unit; David Newman,
Chief, Defense, International Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs Cost
Estimates Unit; Joshua Shakin, Chief, Revenue Projections Unit;
Kathleen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit;
Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; H.
Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; Chad
Chirico, Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goal
and objective of this Committee Print is to provide recommenda-
tions to the Committee on Budget that reduce the deficit by at
least $10 billion over the next decade, while making necessary in-
vestments in border security, national security, and aviation safety.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of the
T&I Committee Print, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a
program of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of an-
other Federal program, a program that was included in any report
from the Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to
section 21 of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a pro-
gram identified in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic As-
sistance.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND
LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional
earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined
in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of the rule XXI.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(Public Law 104–4).
PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the
report of any Committee on a bill or joint resolution to include a
statement on the extent to which the bill or joint resolution is in-
tended to preempt state, local, or tribal law. The Committee finds
that the T&I Committee Print, as amended, does not preempt any
state, local, or tribal law.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the definition of Section 5(b) of
Public Law 92–463 (5 U.S.C. 10004(b)), the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee Act, are created by this legislation.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the Committee Print does not relate
to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public serv-
ices or accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of
the Congressional Accountability Act (Public Law 104–1).

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE PRINT
Sec. 100001. Coast Guard Assets Necessary to Secure the Maritime
Border and Interdict Migrants and Drugs
This section provides $21.2 billion to the United States Coast
Guard (Coast Guard or the Service) for the acquisition,
sustainment, improvement, and operations of Coast Guard assets
necessary to provide presence, surveillance, and security of the
maritime border. Specifically this section makes the following
funds available for obligation through September 30, 2029: $571.5
million for fixed wing aircraft; $1.283 billion for rotary wing air-
craft; $140 million for long-range unmanned aircraft and base sta-
tions; $4.3 billion for Offshore Patrol Cutters; $1 billion for Fast
Response Cutters; $4.3 billion for Polar Security Cutters; $4.978
billion for Arctic Security Cutters and domestic icebreakers; $3.154
billion for shoreside infrastructure, of which $400 million is for
hangars, maintenance, and crew facilities for fixed wing aircraft
and rotary wing aircraft, $2.33 billion is for homeports for Offshore
Patrol Cutters, Fast Response Cutters, Arctic Security Cutters,
Polar Security Cutters, and National Security Cutters, and $425
million for design, engineering, construction management of, and
program management for enlisted boot camp recapitalization, in-
cluding barracks’ replacement and a multi-use training center; $1.3
billion for aviation, cutter, and shoreside facility depot mainte-
nance, of which $500 million is for a floating dry dock; and $180
million for maritime domain awareness, of which $75 million is for
autonomous surface assets.
This section waives certain acquisitions requirements under
chapter 11 of title 14, United States Code, related to acquisition,
procurement, and construction for programs funded with appropria-
tions under this section. Additionally, this section allows the use of
a vessel construction manager for the construction of a floating dry-
dock, Arctic Security Cutters, or domestic icebreakers. It also limits
design, planning and engineering to 15 percent of the amount ap-
propriated.
Before spending funds appropriated by this section, the Coast
Guard is required to submit overdue reports on Coast Guard acqui-
sition, provide an expenditure plan, and notify the Congressional
committees of jurisdiction before taking actions impacting esti-
mated acquisition costs or timelines. Finally, the President is re-
quired to notify the Congressional Committees of jurisdiction before
exercising an exception under section 1151(b) of title 14, United
States Code.
Sec. 100002. Changes to Mandatory Benefits Programs to Allow Se-
lected Reserve Orders for Preplanned Missions to Secure Mari-
time Borders and Interdict Persons and Drugs
This section gives the Commandant of the Coast Guard the au-
thority to order any member of the Selected Reserve to active duty
for no more than 365 consecutive days to conduct preplanned mis-
sions.
Under current law, the Coast Guard has authority to call up re-
servists to respond to emergencies. In contrast, the Department of
Defense has the authority to call up the reservists of the other five

armed forces both to respond to emergencies and to conduct
preplanned activities. This section provides the Coast Guard parity
with the other armed forces.
Sec. 100003. Vessel Tonnage Duties
This section increases vessel tonnage duties imposed on vessels
that enter the United States from a foreign port or place or depart
from and return to a United States port or place after a ‘‘voyage
to nowhere.’’ Current tonnage duty rates were established in 1909
and were temporarily increased in fiscal years (FYs) 2006 through
2010. This section returns the tonnage duty level to the amount
that was imposed in FYs 2006 through 2010.
Sec. 100004. Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles
This section directs the Administrator of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) to impose the following Federal annual
motor vehicle registration fees: $250 for an electric vehicle and
$100 for a hybrid vehicle. This section also requires each fee to be
increased annually for inflation. Covered motor vehicles include ve-
hicles intended for roadway use but exclude commercial motor ve-
hicles and covered farm vehicles. This section requires that the col-
lection of fees for electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles begins no
later than the end of FY 2026 and that these fees terminate in FY
2035.
This section instructs state departments of transportation to col-
lect the fees and remit the balance of the fees collected monthly to
the FHWA Administrator. If a state fails to remit collected fees re-
quired under this section, FHWA will withhold Federal highway
formula funding at an amount equal to 125 percent of the fees that
were required to be remitted.
Additionally, this section provides $104 million for states to es-
tablish the registration fee process, providing that a state may re-
ceive not more than $2 million. A state found to be in compliance
with this section is permitted to retain up to one percent of total
fees collected by that state for administrative expenses.
This section requires the FHWA Administrator to issue any nec-
essary regulations and guidance to carry out this section. This sec-
tion also requires that the Administrator report to Congress on the
status of implementation.
Sec. 100005. Deposit of Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles
This section provides that amounts accrued pursuant to 23
U.S.C. 180 (the fees on motor vehicles created in section 100004 of
this Committee Print) are deposited into the Highway Trust Fund.
Sec. 100006. Motor Carrier Data
This section provides $5 million to the Administrator of the Fed-
eral Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to establish a
public website that details whether each motor carrier, as defined
in section 13102, of title 49 United States Code, meets FMCSA op-
erating requirements. Additionally, this section establishes an an-
nual $100 fee for accessing the website. This section also details
that a broker, freight forwarder, or household goods freight for-
warder who relies on the website’s determinations of whether

motor carriers have met FMCSA requirements has made reason-
able and prudent determinations when engaging that motor car-
rier.
Sec. 100007. IRA Rescissions
This section permanently rescinds unobligated balances for seven
programs created under the Inflation Reduction Act: alternative
fuel and low-emission aviation technology program, neighborhood
access and equity grant program, Federal building assistance, use
of low-carbon materials for Federal building assistance, General
Services Administration emerging technologies, environmental re-
view implementation funds, and low-carbon transportation mate-
rials grants.
Sec. 100008. Air Traffic Control Staffing and Modernization
This section appropriates $12.5 billion to the Administrator of
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the acquisition,
sustainment, improvement, and operation of facilities and equip-
ment necessary to improve or maintain aviation safety, as well as
supporting the personnel related to those facilities. Specifically, the
section makes the following funds available for obligation until
September 30, 2029: $2.16 billion for air traffic control tower and
terminal radar approach control facility replacement, of which at
least $240 million will be available for Contract Tower Program air
traffic control tower replacement and airport sponsor-owned air
traffic control tower replacement; $3 billion for radar systems re-
placement; $4.75 billion for telecommunications infrastructure re-
placement; $500 million for runway safety projects, airport surface
surveillance projects, and to carry out section 347 of the FAA Reau-
thorization Act of 2024 related to surface safety risk mitigation;
$550 million for unstaffed infrastructure sustainment and replace-
ment; $300 million to carry out section 619 of the FAA Reauthor-
ization Act of 2024 related to NextGen programs; $260 million to
carry out the Don Young Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative; and $1
billion for air traffic controller recruitment, retention, training, and
advanced training technologies. Additionally, this section requires
the FAA Administrator to provide a quarterly report on how these
funds have been expended.
Sec. 100009. Kennedy Center Appropriations
This section appropriates nearly $241.8 million, which will re-
main available for obligation until September 30, 2029, for ex-
penses related to capital repair and restoration of the John F. Ken-
nedy Center for the Performing Arts (Kennedy Center). The section
also appropriates $7.7 million, which is available for obligation
until September 30, 2026, for the operation, maintenance, and se-
curity at the Kennedy Center. Additionally, the section appro-
priates $7.2 million, available until September 30, 2029, for admin-
istrative expenses.

scribed in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1)) or submit an
application for reemployment with such employer (in the case of a
person described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of such paragraph).
Except as provided in subparagraph (B), such period of recovery

that satisfies regulations prescribed by the Secretary shall satisfy
the documentation requirements in such paragraph. (3)(A) Except
as provided in subparagraph (B), the failure of a person to provide
documentation that satisfies regulations prescribed pursuant to
paragraph (2) shall not be a basis for denying reemployment in ac-
cordance with the provisions of this chapter if the failure occurs be-
cause such documentation does not exist or is not readily available
at the time of the request of the employer. If, after such reemploy-
ment, documentation becomes available that establishes that such
person does not meet one or more of the requirements referred to
in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1), the employer

oped through negotiations between the Secretary of Defense and a
private insurer, that is available for purchase by or for the use of
a person who is no longer a member of the armed forces or a cov-

(c) COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE OF FEE.—
(1) COLLECTION OF FEE.—A State motor vehicle department
shall—
(A) incorporate the collection of the fees established under

(B) obtain approval from the Administrator to establish
an alternate means of compliance for the collection of such
fees that is acceptable to the Administrator.
(2) REMITTANCE OF FEE.—Not later than 30 days after the
last day of each month, a State motor vehicle department shall

MINORITY VIEWS
Committee Democrats oppose the Committee’s Budget Reconcili-
ation recommendations, as amended and ordered transmitted to
the House Committee on the Budget on April 30, 2025, pursuant
to H. Con. Res. 14.
Reconciliation is an inherently partisan process, and we recog-
nize that this legislation is a departure from the regular work of
this Committee.
Democrats stand ready to work with the Majority on transpor-
tation and infrastructure investment and other shared goals, but
not to further the instructions of H. Con. Res. 14, a fiscally reckless
package that provides a gut punch to hardworking families. The
Republican Reconciliation package adds more than $14 trillion in
new debt over ten years; gives away $7 trillion in deficit-financed
tax cuts to the wealthy; and slashes access to health care and food
assistance for families.
We agree that providing additional resources for the Coast
Guard, funding to improve our air traffic control system, and shor-
ing up investments in surface transportation are important invest-
ments.
In the 117th Congress, Democrats used the gavel to enact his-
toric levels of funding for all means of travel, to promote clean en-
ergy, to support supply chain improvements, to modernize water
infrastructure, and to build and connect stronger, healthier commu-
nities. In stark contrast to the tax giveaways to billionaires ad-
vanced by Republicans, Democrats promoted investments in public
goods designed to benefit everyone, not a select few, for decades to
come. In addition, one of the revenue raisers in this bill is an in-
crease to the tonnage tax. This tax is assessed on all cargo entering
the United States and will increase costs for all Americans.
We are also deeply concerned that the budget resolution that
underlies this reconciliation legislation leaves little room to ad-
vance robust bipartisan investments for the remainder of this Con-
gress. The budget resolution cuts transportation budget authority
by $406 billion over the next ten years compared to the CBO base-
line.
These assumptions do not include a continuation of the nearly
$200 billion enacted by the 117th Congress through emergency ad-
vanced appropriations which end in September 2026. These invest-
ments include: $66 billion in guaranteed investment in passenger
and freight rail, $47 billion in bridge investments, $25 billion in
airport grants, $21 billion in transit rail and bus grants, $13 billion
to shore up Clean Water State Revolving Funds, $12 billion to sup-
plement major project grants, and $2 billion for port infrastructure
development. The budget resolution does not provide room to con-
tinue these investments, nor does the resolution provide a reserve

fund to accommodate transportation or infrastructure legislation
outside of the budget allocations.
Reauthorization of surface transportation programs is a major
priority for the Committee in the 119th Congress. The Highway
Trust Fund (HTF) faces a deficit of over $140 billion in the next
five years. The changes to motor vehicle fees contained in the Com-
mittee recommendations represent a marked shift in how we gen-
erate revenue for highways and transit. These changes deserve ro-
bust debate and a full vetting of views by members on both sides
of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol, by Governors, Mayors,
transportation stakeholders and many others.
The day before marking up the Committee recommendations, the
Committee received testimony that $90 per year is an equivalent
charge for electric vehicles (EVs) if the goal is to ensure EVs pay
into the HTF on par with what drivers of gas-powered vehicles pay.
This legislation, as amended, institutes a fee of $250 per year for
EVs and $100 for hybrid vehicles, establishing EV and hybrid fees
that far exceed what is paid by the average gas-powered vehicle.
This legislation does not execute the deposit of these fees into the
Highway Trust Fund, to both the Highway and Mass Transit Ac-
counts, as is the current practice with other revenues. We agree
that current gas tax revenues are insufficient to fund surface trans-
portation needs. We also agree on the need for a robust debate on
sustainable funding for surface transportation as we move through
reauthorization. A budget resolution without a reserve fund and a
markup that demonstrated a lack of consensus among Republicans
on car fees means we have more work to do.
As noted during the markup, Democrats also strongly oppose
Section 100007 of the legislation that claws back funding provided
by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The cuts contained in the
Committee recommendations are unnecessary to comply with the
Senate reconciliation instructions. These programs are targeted for
cuts simply because our colleagues don’t agree with the policies.
Many of the grant programs listed for rescission have already
been announced for specific projects. For example, the rescission of
Neighborhood Access Grants claws back 80 grants that have been
awarded—including to projects in 41 Congressional districts rep-
resented by Republican Members. Communities have spent time
and resources applying for these grants and are relying on the an-
ticipated funds in their budgets. Cutting this funding is a direct at-
tack on many of our constituents. A list of announced projects
under the IRA’s Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants is at-
tached.
Similarly, the legislation rescinds unobligated balances of IRA
funding provided to the General Services Administration to im-
prove and upgrade federal buildings and Land Ports of Entry.
These rescissions are expected to impact over 140 projects across
the country, a list of which is attached.
A robust debate at markup, in which Democrats offered 100
amendments, demonstrates the desire to work together and make
investments that can garner broad support. We have a lot of work
to do together this Congress to support the Coast Guard, to im-
prove our air traffic control system, and to shore up investments
in surface transportation. This Committee does not exist in a vacu-

um, however, and the product produced by the Committee will go
into a fiscally irresponsible package with massive cuts to hard-
working families. For these reasons, Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee Democrats opposed the legislation.
