Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 161]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 161) to require the Secretary of
Transportation to issue rules relating to the testing procedures
used under the New Car Assessment Program of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and for other purposes,
having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with an
amendment in the nature of a substitute and recommends that the
bill, as amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 161, She DRIVES Act, is to require the Sec-
retary of Transportation to issue rules relating to the testing proce-
dures under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and the
New Car Assessment Program of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
According to early estimates from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were 40,990 traffic fatalities
in 2023.1 NHTSA is responsible for enforcing vehicle safety stand-
ards with the goal of reducing crashes and injuries on the roadway.
NHTSA sets vehicle safety standards by issuing vehicle safety reg-

ulations known as the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
(FMVSS). The FMVSS are safety regulations that specify design,
construction, performance, and durability requirements for motor
vehicles. Manufacturers are responsible for certifying that their
products meet all FMVSS to sell vehicles in the United States.
NHTSA also administers the New Car Assessment Program
(NCAP), also known as the five-star safety ratings program. This
motor vehicle crash test program evaluates new vehicles for crash-
worthiness, crash avoidance technology, and pedestrian protection.2
The requirements to achieve a five-star rating go above and beyond
what is required by FMVSS to encourage manufacturers to build
vehicles that consistently achieve high ratings.
To provide manufacturers a repeatable and consistent way to
measure occupant protection across different vehicle makes and
models, NHTSA requires manufacturers to use test dummies, also
known as anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs), to measure the im-
pact to vehicle occupants in crash tests. NHTSA sets requirements
for the type of ATDs used in crash tests, including for durability,
biofidelity, repeatability, and reproducibility.3 However, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) has found that the data col-
lected from the current ATDs does not measure whether the vehi-
cle safety features are effective for a diverse range of people.4 For
example, the current ATDs may not adequately measure the risks
of lower leg injuries for females compared to males in similar
crashes.5
According to an ATD manufacturer’s description, the current
adult female ATD is a scaled-down version of the male ATD.6 This
means that while the height is reduced, internally, the dummy
used to represent the female body is based off the bone mass, bone
structure, musculature, fat distribution, and organ distribution of
a male.7 The Committee is concerned that this inaccurate represen-
tation has potentially created a safety disparity. Women have a 73-
percent higher risk of injury from fatal car crashes than males and
are more likely to sustain injuries to their pelvis or liver. Testing
key safety features with ATDs designed to accurately reflect a
greater range of human anatomies in the driver’s seat could help
protect more vehicle occupants from injuries in real-world crashes.8
Given the inadequacy of the current ATDs and the significant fa-
tality and injury rate disparity between men and women, the Com-
mittee believes action is needed to address this public safety con-
cern. This legislation requires NHTSA to update its regulations to
adopt more technologically advanced ATDs that represent the 50th

percentile adult male and ATDs that represent the 5th percentile
adult female for front and side impact crash testing for both NCAP
and FMVSS.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 161 would do the following:
• Require NHTSA to amend its regulations to require the use of
more technologically advanced ATDs that represent the 50th
percentile adult male and ATDs that represent the 5th per-
centile adult female for front and side impact crash testing.
• Require NHTSA to update NCAP crashworthiness testing pro-
cedures to include crashworthiness frontal impact and side im-
pact tests for female occupants in all front seating positions.
• When updating the ATD regulation, establish injury criteria to
better measure the risk of injury or death in crashes that are
based on real-world data and the greatest potential to increase
safety.
• Require NHTSA to send a report within 1 year to the relevant
congressional committees providing a roadmap with deadlines
for NHTSA to update its regulation to require the use of more
advanced ATDs, and to update the report on NHTSA’s progress
in meeting the roadmap deadline 5 years after the report is
submitted.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 161 was introduced on January 21, 2025, by Senator Fischer
(for herself and Senators Murray, Blackburn, and Duckworth) and
was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Trans-
portation of the Senate. Senators Collins, Welch, Capito, Schatz,
Britt, Hickenlooper, Rosen, and Daines are additional cosponsors.
On February 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Ses-
sion and, by voice vote, ordered S. 161 to be reported favorably
with an amendment (in the nature of a substitute).
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

S. 161 would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad-
ministration (NHTSA) to conduct additional crash tests for motor
vehicles using devices that represent female drivers. The agency
does not currently use such devices for all test types. The bill also
would require NHTSA to issue rules requiring the use of newer,
more advanced crash test devices by both the agency and vehicle
manufacturers. Finally, S. 161 would require NHTSA to report to
the Congress twice on its plans to incorporate additional advanced
crash test devices—once within a year of enactment and again in

Section 2:
2031.
Based on information from the agency, CBO expects that NHTSA
would spend about $3 million annually, beginning in 2027, for ad-
ditional test vehicles and about $500,000 annually for additional
staff and equipment. On that basis, and accounting for anticipated
inflation, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $14
million over the 2025–2030 period. CBO expects the bill’s rule-
making requirements would largely codify NHTSA’s planned rule-
making processes and would have an insignificant cost. Based on
the costs of similar activities, CBO estimates that the two reports
would cost less than $500,000. Any increase in spending to imple-
ment the bill would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 400 (transportation).

ufacturers to use advanced crash test devices and to conduct addi-
tional tests using devices that represent females in the driver’s
seat.
The cost of compliance for manufacturers would stem from two,
one-time expenditures as manufacturers replace their inventories
of testing devices. Based on information from the automotive indus-
try, CBO estimates that each device would cost about $1 million.
Because manufacturers own some of the devices required for front-
impact testing, CBO estimates the cost to replace existing testing
devices with advanced devices would total between $50 million and
$60 million. When standards for side-impact testing devices are fi-
nalized, we estimate the cost to replace existing side impact testing
devices would be between $150 million and $160 million. CBO esti-
mates that the cost of additional testing would incrementally in-
crease the annual cost of testing by a small amount. Because those
costs would occur over multiple years, CBO estimates that the total
cost of the mandates in a single year would fall below the threshold
established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($206 million in
2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would not impose intergovernmental mandates as de-
fined in UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Willow Latham-
Proenc¸a (for federal costs) and Lucy Marret (for mandates). The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.

Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 161, as reported, would require NHTSA to update the stand-
ards for ATDs and NCAP. The bill would affect the manufacturers
of passenger motor vehicles sold in the United States, all of which
are already subject to NHTSA regulations. The number of persons
covered should be consistent with those currently subject to the
ATD and NCAP regulations.
Economic Impact
S. 161, as reported, is expected to have modest economic costs as-
sociated with initial implementation and ongoing administrative
expenses. The bill would require NHTSA to purchase new ATDs
and conduct additional crash tests when conducting an NCAP anal-
ysis on a single vehicle model, requiring additional resources to test
the same number of models, or impact the number of vehicles the
agency tests. A THOR–50M dummy, which is reusable, is esti-
mated to cost up to $750,000, according to NHTSA.9 Although

there are upfront costs, it is hoped that the benefits to vehicle safe-
ty standards from covering a more diverse population and the pos-
sibility for an overall reduction in fatalities and injuries will out-
weigh the initial costs.
Privacy
S. 161, as reported, would not have any adverse impact on the
personal privacy of individuals.
Paperwork
S. 161, as reported, would not increase paperwork requirements
for private individuals or businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

Section 4:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 5:
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘She
Develops Regulations In Vehicle Equality and Safety Act’’ or the
‘‘She DRIVES Act’’.

Section 6:
Section 2. Definitions.
This section would define the terms ‘‘crashworthiness’’, ‘‘Sec-
retary’’, and ‘‘testing device’’.

Section 7:
Section 3. Federal motor vehicle safety standards update.
This section would require NHTSA to update FMVSS to require
frontal impact testing to include the 50th percentile adult male
Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) frontal impact
testing device and the 5th percentile adult female THOR frontal
impact testing device no later than 15 days after enactment.
This section would require the Secretary to issue a final rule that
requires the use of the THOR frontal impact testing device. In
issuing this rule, the Secretary would be required to establish or
update the injury criteria based on new data, and establish frontal
impact tests for adult female occupants with all front seating posi-
tions tested.
This section would require NHTSA to revise the FMVSS no later
than 18 months after enactment to require side impact testing to
include the: (1) 50th percentile adult male Worldwide Harmonized
Side Impact Dummy side impact testing device and (2) 5th per-
centile adult female Worldwide Harmonized Side Impact Dummy
side impact testing device. Lastly, this section would require the
Secretary to issue a final rule that requires the use of the side im-
pact testing devices no later than 30 months after enactment.

Section 8:
Section 4. New car assessment program update.
This section would require NHTSA to promulgate the final deci-
sion notices to update the crashworthiness testing procedures for
both front and side impact testing devices under the New Car As-
sessment Program. This section would also require that the final
decision notices be issued concurrently with the final rules, or if
issuing the decision and the rule together would delay the rule,
then NHTSA will issue the rule first.

Section 9:
Section 5. Testing devices roadmap.
This section would require NHTSA to submit a report to Con-
gress that outlines a timeline of incorporating the testing devices,
identify testing devices of other countries that are more advanced
than the U.S. testing devices being used or researched, and de-
scribe its process of updating the testing devices required under the
FMVSS no later than 1 year after enactment. If NHTSA believes
the testing devices do not need to be updated, NHTSA would in-
clude its justification. NHTSA would be required to submit a fol-
low-up report to Congress no later than 5 years after the initial re-
port on the Secretary’s progress on meeting the report’s timelines
and whether the Secretary has identified any new testing devices.

Section 10:
Section 6. Savings provision.
This section would preserve the Secretary’s authority to revise or
update a testing device regardless of the specific rulemaking or no-
tices required in this Act.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.

percentile adult male and ATDs that represent the 5th percentile
adult female for front and side impact crash testing for both NCAP
and FMVSS.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 161 would do the following:
• Require NHTSA to amend its regulations to require the use of
more technologically advanced ATDs that represent the 50th
percentile adult male and ATDs that represent the 5th per-
centile adult female for front and side impact crash testing.
• Require NHTSA to update NCAP crashworthiness testing pro-
cedures to include crashworthiness frontal impact and side im-
pact tests for female occupants in all front seating positions.
• When updating the ATD regulation, establish injury criteria to
better measure the risk of injury or death in crashes that are
based on real-world data and the greatest potential to increase
safety.
• Require NHTSA to send a report within 1 year to the relevant
congressional committees providing a roadmap with deadlines
for NHTSA to update its regulation to require the use of more
advanced ATDs, and to update the report on NHTSA’s progress
in meeting the roadmap deadline 5 years after the report is
submitted.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 161 was introduced on January 21, 2025, by Senator Fischer
(for herself and Senators Murray, Blackburn, and Duckworth) and
was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Trans-
portation of the Senate. Senators Collins, Welch, Capito, Schatz,
Britt, Hickenlooper, Rosen, and Daines are additional cosponsors.
On February 5, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Ses-
sion and, by voice vote, ordered S. 161 to be reported favorably
with an amendment (in the nature of a substitute).
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

S. 161 would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad-
ministration (NHTSA) to conduct additional crash tests for motor
vehicles using devices that represent female drivers. The agency
does not currently use such devices for all test types. The bill also
would require NHTSA to issue rules requiring the use of newer,
more advanced crash test devices by both the agency and vehicle
manufacturers. Finally, S. 161 would require NHTSA to report to
the Congress twice on its plans to incorporate additional advanced
crash test devices—once within a year of enactment and again in
2031.
Based on information from the agency, CBO expects that NHTSA
would spend about $3 million annually, beginning in 2027, for ad-
ditional test vehicles and about $500,000 annually for additional
staff and equipment. On that basis, and accounting for anticipated
inflation, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $14
million over the 2025–2030 period. CBO expects the bill’s rule-
making requirements would largely codify NHTSA’s planned rule-
making processes and would have an insignificant cost. Based on
the costs of similar activities, CBO estimates that the two reports
would cost less than $500,000. Any increase in spending to imple-
ment the bill would be subject to the availability of appropriated
funds.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 400 (transportation).

ufacturers to use advanced crash test devices and to conduct addi-
tional tests using devices that represent females in the driver’s
seat.
The cost of compliance for manufacturers would stem from two,
one-time expenditures as manufacturers replace their inventories
of testing devices. Based on information from the automotive indus-
try, CBO estimates that each device would cost about $1 million.
Because manufacturers own some of the devices required for front-
impact testing, CBO estimates the cost to replace existing testing
devices with advanced devices would total between $50 million and
$60 million. When standards for side-impact testing devices are fi-
nalized, we estimate the cost to replace existing side impact testing
devices would be between $150 million and $160 million. CBO esti-
mates that the cost of additional testing would incrementally in-
crease the annual cost of testing by a small amount. Because those
costs would occur over multiple years, CBO estimates that the total
cost of the mandates in a single year would fall below the threshold
established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($206 million in
2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill would not impose intergovernmental mandates as de-
fined in UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Willow Latham-
Proenc¸a (for federal costs) and Lucy Marret (for mandates). The es-
timate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of
Budget Analysis.

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 161, as reported, would require NHTSA to update the stand-
ards for ATDs and NCAP. The bill would affect the manufacturers
of passenger motor vehicles sold in the United States, all of which
are already subject to NHTSA regulations. The number of persons
covered should be consistent with those currently subject to the
ATD and NCAP regulations.
Economic Impact
S. 161, as reported, is expected to have modest economic costs as-
sociated with initial implementation and ongoing administrative
expenses. The bill would require NHTSA to purchase new ATDs
and conduct additional crash tests when conducting an NCAP anal-
ysis on a single vehicle model, requiring additional resources to test
the same number of models, or impact the number of vehicles the
agency tests. A THOR–50M dummy, which is reusable, is esti-
mated to cost up to $750,000, according to NHTSA.9 Although

there are upfront costs, it is hoped that the benefits to vehicle safe-
ty standards from covering a more diverse population and the pos-
sibility for an overall reduction in fatalities and injuries will out-
weigh the initial costs.
Privacy
S. 161, as reported, would not have any adverse impact on the
personal privacy of individuals.
Paperwork
S. 161, as reported, would not increase paperwork requirements
for private individuals or businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘She
Develops Regulations In Vehicle Equality and Safety Act’’ or the
‘‘She DRIVES Act’’.
Section 2. Definitions.
This section would define the terms ‘‘crashworthiness’’, ‘‘Sec-
retary’’, and ‘‘testing device’’.
Section 3. Federal motor vehicle safety standards update.
This section would require NHTSA to update FMVSS to require
frontal impact testing to include the 50th percentile adult male
Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) frontal impact
testing device and the 5th percentile adult female THOR frontal
impact testing device no later than 15 days after enactment.
This section would require the Secretary to issue a final rule that
requires the use of the THOR frontal impact testing device. In
issuing this rule, the Secretary would be required to establish or
update the injury criteria based on new data, and establish frontal
impact tests for adult female occupants with all front seating posi-
tions tested.
This section would require NHTSA to revise the FMVSS no later
than 18 months after enactment to require side impact testing to
include the: (1) 50th percentile adult male Worldwide Harmonized
Side Impact Dummy side impact testing device and (2) 5th per-
centile adult female Worldwide Harmonized Side Impact Dummy
side impact testing device. Lastly, this section would require the
Secretary to issue a final rule that requires the use of the side im-
pact testing devices no later than 30 months after enactment.

Section 4. New car assessment program update.
This section would require NHTSA to promulgate the final deci-
sion notices to update the crashworthiness testing procedures for
both front and side impact testing devices under the New Car As-
sessment Program. This section would also require that the final
decision notices be issued concurrently with the final rules, or if
issuing the decision and the rule together would delay the rule,
then NHTSA will issue the rule first.
Section 5. Testing devices roadmap.
This section would require NHTSA to submit a report to Con-
gress that outlines a timeline of incorporating the testing devices,
identify testing devices of other countries that are more advanced
than the U.S. testing devices being used or researched, and de-
scribe its process of updating the testing devices required under the
FMVSS no later than 1 year after enactment. If NHTSA believes
the testing devices do not need to be updated, NHTSA would in-
clude its justification. NHTSA would be required to submit a fol-
low-up report to Congress no later than 5 years after the initial re-
port on the Secretary’s progress on meeting the report’s timelines
and whether the Secretary has identified any new testing devices.
Section 6. Savings provision.
This section would preserve the Secretary’s authority to revise or
update a testing device regardless of the specific rulemaking or no-
tices required in this Act.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
