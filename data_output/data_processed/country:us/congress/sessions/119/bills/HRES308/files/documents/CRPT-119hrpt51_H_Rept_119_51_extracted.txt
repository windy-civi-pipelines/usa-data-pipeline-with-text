STATEMENT OF BUDGET AUTHORITY AND RELATED ITEMS
The resolution does not provide new budget authority, new
spending authority, new credit authority, or an increase or de-
crease in revenues or tax expenditures and a statement under
House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(2) and section 308(a)(1) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 is not required.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
In compliance with House rule XIII, clause 3(c)(3), the Com-
mittee states, with respect to H. Res. 308, that the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office did not submit a cost estimate and
comparison under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of

Section 2:
1974.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
On November 17, 2024, Dr. Neelam Taneja Perry (‘‘Contestant’’)
filed a Notice of Contest with the Clerk of the House of Representa-
tives pursuant to the Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA).1
Contestant ran as a candidate in the August 20, 2024, closed Re-
publican primary election for the office of Representative to the
United States Congress representing the Fourteenth Congressional
District of the State of Florida. Contestant finished in fourth place
in the primary election, with 1,594 votes.2 Robert Rochford received
15,575 votes and advanced to the general election as the Repub-
lican candidate.
BASIS OF CONTEST
In her Notice of Contest, Contestant asserts that irregularities
and alleged misconduct took place during the Republican primary
election and the general election for the Fourteenth District of Flor-
ida and, because these irregularities and misconduct occurred, the
election results should thereby be invalidated. Contestant alleges
election fraud, misconduct and procedural violations, corruption
and abuse of authority, and conspiracy by officials in both the Re-
publican and Democratic parties took place. Contestant is asking
that the House disqualify Kathy Castor, the winner of the general
election for the Fourteenth District of Florida, order a review to de-
termine whether election law violations occurred, and nominate
Contestant for the congressional seat.
STANDING
To have standing under the FCEA, a contestant must have been
a candidate for election to the House of Representatives in the last
preceding election and claim a right to the contested seat.3 FCEA
also states that the House of Representatives has jurisdiction over
official general and special elections, excluding a primary election,
or a caucus or convention of a political party. Since Contestant was
a candidate in the primary election for the Fourteenth Congres-
12 U.S.C. §381–96.

sional District of Florida, and not a candidate in the general elec-
tion, Contestant therefore lacks standing.
TIMING/NOTICE
The Notice of Contest was filed with the Clerk of the House of
Representatives on November 17, 2024. However, the timing of
Contestant’s filing is not relevant to the determination of this
claim, because Contestant lacks standing.
ANALYSIS
Under FCEA, the House of Representatives has jurisdiction over
official general and special elections, but ‘‘election’’ does not include
a primary election, or a caucus or convention of a political party.4
Contestant filed as a candidate in Florida for federal office with Re-
publican party affiliation.5 Contestant was a qualified candidate in
the primary election for the Fourteenth Congressional District of
Florida, who lost and was therefore not a candidate in the general
election.6 The Committee finds that this claim must be dismissed
due to lack of standing.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Committee therefore con-
cludes that this contest should be dismissed.
