OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF THE BILL
The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administra-
tion, and Related Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for
a wide array of Federal programs, mostly in the U.S. Department
of Agriculture [USDA]. These programs include agricultural re-
search, education, and extension activities; natural resources con-
servation programs; farm income and support programs; marketing
and inspection activities; domestic food assistance programs; rural
housing, economic and community development, and telecommuni-
cation and electrification assistance; and various export and inter-
national activities of the USDA.
The bill also provides funding for the Food and Drug Administra-
tion [FDA] and allows the use of collected fees for administrative
expenses of the Farm Credit Administration [FCA].
The discretionary programs and activities of USDA and FDA
that are supported by this bill include high priority responsibilities
entrusted to the Federal Government and its partners to protect
human health and safety, contribute to economic recovery, and
achieve policy objectives strongly supported by the American peo-
ple.
All accounts in the bill have been closely examined to ensure
that an appropriate level of funding is provided to carry out the
programs of USDA, FDA, and FCA. Details on each of the ac-
counts, the funding level, and the Committee’s justifications for the
funding levels are included in the report.
Fiscal year 2025 levels cited in this report reflect amounts en-
acted in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions
Act, 2025 (Public Law 119–4) and do not include fiscal year 2025
supplemental appropriations. Accordingly, any comparisons to fis-
cal year 2025 do not reflect fiscal year 2025 supplemental appro-
priations. Fiscal year 2025 supplemental appropriations are in-
cluded in the comparative statement of new budget authority at
the end of this report under the heading ‘‘Other Appropriations’’.
REPORTS TO CONGRESS
The Committee has, throughout this report, requested agencies
to provide studies and reports on various issues. The Committee
utilizes these reports to evaluate program performance and make
decisions on future appropriations. The Committee directs that all
studies and reports be provided to the Committee as electronic doc-
uments in an agreed upon format within 120 days after the date
of enactment of this act, unless an alternative submission schedule
is specifically stated in the report.

Agricultural Supply Chain Security.—The Committee recognizes
the threat adversaries pose to our nation’s agricultural and food
systems. The Committee encourages the Department to consider
ways to invest in the development of critical inputs, and secure
data domestically. Additionally, the Committee requests a briefing
on our current reliance on adversaries for inputs, such as but not
limited to amino acids, vitamins, fertilizers, and pesticides.
Biosecurity Workforce Readiness.—The Committee encourages
the Department of Agriculture to strengthen internal capacity re-
lated to biotechnology and biosecurity as they pertain to national
and economic security. The Committee supports the development of
core competencies for USDA personnel working on biotechnology
policy, including regular training on emerging technologies, labora-
tory methods, biosecurity protocols, and relevant data systems. The
Committee also encourages the Department to evaluate whether
key personnel involved in biotechnology and biosecurity decision-
making hold appropriate security clearances and have timely ac-
cess to relevant classified information.
Colonias and Farmworker Initiatives.—The Committee requests
an update on the Department’s effort to streamline and coordinate
existing Federal programs serving colonias and farmworkers, in-
cluding housing, healthcare, water infrastructure, and broadband
programs, and the consideration of establishing an ‘‘Office of
Colonias and Farmworker Initiatives’’.
Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] Obligations and Commit-
ments.—The Secretary is directed to notify the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House and Senate in writing 15 days prior to
any announcement on the use or cancellation of funds from the
CCC or the obligation, commitment, transfer, or cancellation of any
emergency funds from the CCC.
The Committee also reminds USDA that while the Secretary has
broad authority to utilize the CCC for emergencies such as the re-
cent outbreak of high pathogen avian influenza, creating programs
with CCC funds that then cannot be implemented without utilizing
the interchange authority, requiring additional appropriated dol-
lars, or that will take years to obligate funding is not an appro-
priate use. As such, the plan required to be submitted as part of
the CCC notification shall also include outyear costs for implemen-
tation and how the Department intends to operationalize the pro-
gram.
Communication from USDA.—A collaborative working relation-
ship between the Committee and USDA is necessary to ensure effi-
cient and effective implementation of Congress’ funding decisions.
USDA is directed to continue notifying the Committee of major
changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its
operations before providing non-governmental stakeholders such
information, before making the changes public, and before imple-
menting them.
Communications Services for Limited English Proficient Commu-
nities.—The Committee supports efforts to improve communica-
tions, which should include mediums such as television and radio,
to reach limited English proficient [LEP] communities. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to review its practices and cre-
ate uniform applications across all Department agencies to
8
strengthen communication practices to include digital, television,
and radio advertising when working with LEP communities. The
Department shall report to the Committee no later than 60 days
after the enactment of this act on planned expenditures in fiscal
year 2026 to reach LEP communities, including local media adver-
tising.
Cover Crops.—The Secretary, in consultation with the Risk Man-
agement Agency, shall submit a written report, within 1 year of en-
actment of this act, on how the Department can streamline oppor-
tunities for farmers to insure primary and secondary crops with
revenue streams resulting from biofuel use, with particular ref-
erence tocarinata, pennycress, camelina, and other oilseeds.
Disaster Assistance.—In December of 2024, the Committee pro-
vided more than $33.5 billion in supplemental disaster assistance
funds for our nation’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities to
assist with market and weather-related losses. The Committee
commends the Department for expeditiously initiating the Emer-
gency Commodity Assistance Program and releasing other funds
including those to assist with livestock losses. The Committee di-
rects the secretary to continue to prioritize the advancement and
dispersal of the remaining weather-related assistance and to keep
the Committee apprised of those efforts. This includes the directive
regarding technical assistance for interested non-insured producers
who wish to participate in the programs.
Federal Trust and Treaty Responsibilities.—The Committee re-
minds agencies funded by this act of their obligation to uphold the
Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes and Federal obli-
gations to the Native Hawaiian Community. This includes uphold-
ing treaty and reserved rights, and any other rights and obligations
under Federal law; supporting self-determination efforts by Native
communities; fulfilling obligations under Presidential Memoranda
and Executive Orders; and conducting early and robust govern-
ment-to-government consultation with Tribes, and meaningful out-
reach and engagement with Native Hawaiians. The Committee fur-
ther reminds agencies that the unique relationship between the
Federal Government and Tribes is based on the political status of
Tribes, and as such, agencies are directed to ensure that the imple-
mentation of Executive Order 14151 does not include American In-
dians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.
Funding Status Report.—Within 30 days of the enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations a written report that pro-
vides a list of each grant, cooperative agreement, and contract
award that was delayed, terminated, or otherwise withheld for
more than five days in calendar year 2025. The report shall include
a justification for delay, termination, or withholding for each grant,
contract, and cooperative agreement, the location of the project or
service, the amount of the award, the current status of the award,
and the source of funding.
Institute for Rural Partnerships.—The Committee recognized the
unique challenges faced by rural communities when it provided
funding in fiscal year 2025 to continue three Institutes for Rural
Partnerships in geographically diverse locations to identify and
support community, statewide and regional partnership to address
9
these challenges. As rural challenges evolve, the continued need for
these Institutes is clear. Therefore, the Committee provides
$6,000,000 to be divided equally to continue the Institute for Rural
Partnerships at established land-grant universities including the
Auburn University Partnership Institute at Auburn University, the
Wisconsin Rural Partnership Institute at the University of Wis-
consin-Madison, and the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships at
the University of Vermont, which were originally funded in fiscal
year 2022. Funding will support focused research and applied tran-
sitional needs locally and regionally.
Office of Tribal Relations.—The Committee supports elevating
the Office of Tribal Relations to an Assistant Secretary level and
encourages the Secretary to evaluate the resources needed.
Resource Conservation and Development Councils.—Since 1964,
the Resource Conservation and Development [RC&D] Councils
have worked at the grassroots level with local leaders to plan, de-
velop, and carry out programs for land and water conservation and
management. The Committee encourages the Secretary to consider
the maximum practical use of RC&D Councils, where such RC&D
Councils meet agency performance requirements, in the delivery of
USDA programs and services.
Rural News Media and Advertising Campaigns.—The Committee
recognizes the critical role local media plays in delivering messages
to small or rural communities. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to utilize local news media in rural areas for USDA adver-
tising campaigns to reach citizens in these communities with key
messages. Local media should include newspapers, including non-
daily newspapers, television, and radio. The Committee directs the
Office of the Secretary to update the Committee within 120 days
of enactment of this act on the efforts of the Department, including
the Agricultural Marketing Service, Rural Development, the Farm
Service Agency, and the Food and Nutrition Service, in utilization
of local media in rural areas as part of the Department’s adver-
tising campaigns for fiscal year 2026.
Seafood Industry Liaison.—The Committee provides $625,000 to
establish a position in the Office of the Secretary solely responsible
for the effective coordination of seafood policies and activities with-
in the Department, and in coordination with the Secretary of Com-
merce and the United States Trade Representative, relating to the
support of domestically harvested and processed wild and farmed
seafood.
Soil Carbon Monitoring.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment, in close collaboration with experts, to conduct a systematic
review of existing USDA and Federal Government soil carbon mon-
itoring methodologies, such as, methodologies that may have been
developed by the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network,
Long-Term Ecological Research Network, the National Ecological
Observatory Network, or other networks, in order to develop a
standardized soil carbon monitoring methodology that is reflective
of current best practices and ensures the scientific rigor necessary
to accurately measure and monitor soil carbon stocks and fluctua-
tions over time and across regions, soil types, and various produc-
tion systems. The Committee encourages the Department to utilize
the standardized methodology and large-scale data analysis and in-
10
sights developed from this review to inform Natural Resources
Conservation Service technical assistance to producers.
Tribal Self-Determination.—The Committee directs the Secretary
to submit a plan for expanding Tribal self-determination beyond
the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and Tribal
Forestry program pilots, including, where possible, through ex-
panding 638 contract authority.
Quarterly Reports.—The Committee is concerned with recent
changes in staffing levels and expects that the Secretary shall
maintain sufficient staffing across the Department to spend the
funds provided and to support the programs and missions outlined
in this act. The Committee also expects timely obligations of the
funds provided within this act. As such, The Committee directs the
Secretary to submit a unified quarterly report detailing staffing
levels and obligated balances across the Department. Staffing data
should provide detail by agency, including current levels and end
of year goals. Obligation data should include year-to-date obliga-
tions and current balances at the mission area, agency, and pro-
gram level. The obligation data shall also include a comparison of
the obligations incurred in the period covered by the update for
this fiscal year to the obligations incurred in the same period in the
previous two fiscal years.
EXECUTIVE OPERATIONS
Executive operations were established as a result of the reorga-
nization of the Department to provide a support team for USDA
policy officials and selected Department-wide services. Activities
under the executive operations include the Office of the Chief Econ-
omist, the National Appeals Division, and the Office of Budget and
Program Analysis.

Data Collection on Religiously Informed Diets.—The Committee
appreciates the Department’s efforts to improve access to kosher
and halal food for Americans with religiously informed diets. How-
ever, the Committee remains concerned about the gaps that still
exist between the need and the products currently available. While
studies to collect data in this area have been conducted in indi-
vidual States, there is a lack of data available at the National
level. The Committee encourages ERS to track and report on the
scope, scale and location of the needs of Americans with religiously
informed diets.
International Commodity Trade.—The Committee recognizes the
economic importance of international trade for U.S. agricultural
commodities and believes that producers and markets would ben-
efit from having access to additional data on the country of destina-
tion or origin of those commodities. The Committee appreciates
that ERS has begun work on the top five agricultural commodity
exports and imports by State and to identify the country of destina-
tion or origin of those commodities. The Committee directs ERS to
publish this data on a quarterly basis in language that is clear,
concise, well-organized, and user-friendly, avoiding unnecessary
complexity so that it is easier for members of the general public to
understand.
Midwest Center of Agricultural Policy.—The Committee encour-
ages the Secretary to continue standing up the new Midwest policy
center and continues providing support for the existing regional
centers.
Organic Data Analysis.—The organic industry has grown at a
tremendous rate over the past several years and accurate data for
the production, pricing, and marketing of organic products is essen-
17
tial. Therefore, the Committee encourages ERS to continue and ex-
pand the efforts relating to organic data analysis.

Agricultural Research Enhancement Awards.—The Committee
remains determined to see that quality research and enhanced
human resources development in the agricultural and related
sciences be a nationwide commitment. Therefore, the Committee
continues its direction that not less than 15 percent of the competi-
tive research grant funds be used for USDA’s agricultural research
39
enhancement awards program, including USDA Established Pro-
gram to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCOR].
Agricultural Workforce Development.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of agriculture workforce training, education, re-
search and outreach activities. The Committee also notes the im-
portant role of junior or community colleges, who are eligible for
AFRI awards, in developing the next generation of our agricultural
workforce. Within the AFRI Education and Workforce Development
initiative, the Committee encourages the Secretary to give strong
consideration to applications from junior or community colleges, as
well as applications that establish or expand career and technical
opportunities in meat and poultry processing considering specific
gaps exist in this sector.
Agriculture and Food Research Initiative.—The Committee pro-
vides $445,200,000 for the Agriculture and Food Research Initia-
tive [AFRI].

Section 3:
Section 7406 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008
(Public Law 110–234) specifies priority areas within AFRI, includ-
ing an emphasis on conventional (classical) plant and animal
breeding. The Committee strongly supports providing farmers na-
tionwide with greater access to cultivars that are locally and re-
gionally adapted to their soils, climates, and farming systems. The
Committee directs the agency to make regionally adapted, publicly
held cultivar development a distinct funding priority within AFRI
for fiscal year 2026 and directs the agency to continue tracking
public cultivar projects within AFRI and report its progress in
meeting this goal.
Agroacoustics.—The Committee recognizes the growing field of
acoustics and the many positive impacts it may have in agriculture,
particularly with respect to pest management. The Committee en-
courages AFRI to prioritize funding for agroacoustics in its basic
and applied research program, as well as through the Food and Ag-
ricultural Science Enhancement Grants.
Alfalfa Seed and Alfalfa Forage Systems Research.—The Com-
mittee notes that research into alfalfa and forage has the potential
to increase alfalfa and forage yields, increase milk production, and
improve genetics. The Committee provides no less than fiscal year
2025 level to support research into the improvement of yields,
water conservation, creation of new uses, and other research areas
holding the potential to advance the alfalfa seed and alfalfa forage
industry.
Algae Research.—The Committee recognizes the opportunities for
innovation in food, fuel, animal feed, and aquaculture in algae re-
search and development. The Committee encourages NIFA to sup-
port research into algae-based initiatives.
Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes.—The Committee sup-
ports the collaboration between USDA and the National Science
Foundation to pursue advances in precision agriculture, food sys-
tem security, and forestry. The ability to meet the critical needs of
the future agricultural workforce, provide tools for resilient agri-
culture and food security are within the mission of the agency in
providing opportunity through innovation. The Committee encour-
ages NIFA to continue supporting the work of the Artificial Intel-
ligence Research Institutes funded through USDA at current fund-
40
ing levels and to begin planning a process for renewal opportuni-
ties.
Biomass for Carbon Dioxide Removal.—The Committee recog-
nizes the opportunities for novel approaches to use biomass in ways
that optimize carbon storage and encourages NIFA to support re-
search into these applications in a manner consistent with existing
food and fiber objectives.
Brucellosis Research.—Federal and State animal health officials
have made eradicating livestock disease with significant reservoirs
a national animal health priority. This need is reflected in the Ag-
riculture Act of 2014 which made the research and development of
surveillance methods, vaccines, vaccination delivery systems or
diagnostics tests a priority research area under the Competitive,
Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act particularly for bovine
brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis. The Committee recognizes the
need for this research and encourages the agency to make competi-
tive grants available to study improved management tools for
zoonotic livestock diseases with significant wildlife reservoirs.
Citrus Disease Research Program.—The Emergency Citrus Dis-
ease Research and Extension Program is intended to discover and
develop tools for early detection, control, and eradication of dis-
eases and pests that threaten domestic citrus production and proc-
essing. In the past, the program has received $25,000,000 per year
in mandatory funding through the Specialty Crop Research Initia-
tive. The Committee believes that research projects funded under
this authority should be prioritized based on the critical threat of
citrus greening and encourages NIFA, to the maximum extent
practicable, to follow the recommendations of the National Agricul-
tural Research, Extension, and Education Advisory Board’s citrus
disease subcommittee and to collaborate with the HLB MAC group.
The Committee encourages NIFA to engage with growers in areas
of emerging citrus production to provide extension services regard-
ing citrus greening.
Education Grants for Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serv-
ing Institutions.—The Committee continues to strongly support and
maintains funding for the Alaska Native-Serving and Native Ha-
waiian-Serving Institutions Education Program.
Enhanced Rock Weathering Research.—The Committee notes
that projects that focus on researching enhanced rock weathering
and related monitoring, reporting, and verification efforts are eligi-
ble for Agriculture and Food Research Initiative [AFRI] awards.
The Committee directs NIFA to prioritize funding for projects ad-
dressing carbon removal through enhanced rock weathering, in-
cluding on monitoring, reporting, and verification [MRV] of carbon
and non-climate agricultural benefits, among other priorities. NIFA
shall report to the Committee 180 days after enactment of this act
on grants awarded for such purposes in the previous fiscal year.
Enteric Methane Innovation.—The Committee recognizes the
value of public research in supporting innovation. The Committee
encourages AFRI to prioritize applications that focus on the ad-
vancement of enteric fermentation solutions, such as cattle feed ad-
ditives, methane-inhibiting vaccines, and breeding for low-methane
cattle, and direct-fed microorganisms.
41
Food Safety.—The Committee continues its recommendation that
NIFA prioritize research on technologies to rapidly and effectively
detect pathogens or contaminants in order to address foodborne ill-
nesses and improve the safety of our Nation’s food supply, includ-
ing research of novel biodetection technologies.
Forest Products.—The Committee recognizes the important role
of the forests products sector to the U.S. economy. The need to cre-
ate new and improved value-added products and renewable energy
from our Nation’s wood supply is critical to the sustainability of the
National economy. The Committee directs NIFA to support re-
search on wood quality improvement and improvement in forest
products evaluation standards and valuation techniques.
Genome to Phenome.—The Committee supports the Agricultural
Genome to Phenome Initiative to support the development of tools
and datasets for the analysis of phenotypes that can be used across
multiple livestock and crop species to improve the output and effi-
ciency of agriculture.
Intermediate Crops.—The Committee is aware of the nascent in-
dustry of ‘‘intermediate crops’’, such as winter camelina, field
pennycress, and carinata, that can be grown on existing farmland
between primary crops to produce feedstocks for renewable
biofuels. These intermediate crops offer similar soil health benefits
to cover crops and represent a new source of income for agricul-
tural producers. Within the funds provided for AFRI, the Com-
mittee encourages NIFA to prioritize funding for projects seeking
to advance the development, adoption, and processing for inter-
mediate crops, particularly under the Foundational and Applied
Science, Supplemental and Alternative Crop, and Sustainable Agri-
culture Systems program areas.
Laying Hen and Turkey Research Program.—The Committee
notes that research into laying hens and turkeys holds the poten-
tial to improve the efficiency and sustainability of laying hen and
turkey production through integrated, collaborative research and
technology transfer. The Committee continues to support research
into laying hen and turkey disease prevention, antimicrobial resist-
ance, nutrition, gut health, and alternative housing systems under
extreme weather conditions, all which hold the potential to advance
the laying hen and turkey industry.
Lowbush Blueberries.—The Committee directs NIFA to work
with research institutions to develop and refine predictive models
and monitoring technologies for native and invasive pests for incor-
poration into integrated pest management programs for naturally
seeded, native berry crops to increase the margin of food safety and
product quality.
Mental Health Support.—The Committee encourages NIFA to ex-
pand programs that deliver peer-to-peer mental health support to
individuals who are engaged in farming, ranching, farm work, and
other occupations relating to agriculture.
New Beginning for Tribal Students.—The Committee is con-
cerned that matching requirements often prevent Tribes, Tribal
Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Organizations from applying
for programs and grants at NIFA. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to waive matching requirements for New Beginning for Trib-
al Students in NIFA in order to reduce the burden on Tribal Com-
42
munities and to increase Tribal participation in USDA programs
and grants.
Organic Research.—USDA’s National Organic Standards Board
[NOSB] has identified key organic research priorities, many of
which would help to address challenges that have limited the
growth in organic production in this country. The Committee en-
courages NIFA to give strong consideration to the NOSB organic
research priorities when crafting the fiscal year 2026 Request for
Applications for AFRI and the Organic Transition Program. Given
the growing demand for organic products, the Committee also en-
courages USDA to increase the number of organic research projects
funded under AFRI and the Specialty Crop Research Initiative.
Precision Management of Live Broiler Production.—The Com-
mittee encourages NIFA to support research focused on improving
animal welfare and health, food safety and food security through
novel broiler chicken live production approaches and methods that
drive transformational innovation in intelligent systems, automa-
tion, robotics, data science, and artificial technologies that could
enable greater efficiencies, better resilience, and viable poultry en-
terprises at various scales of production.
Potato Research.—To minimize the application of pesticides and
to maximize the yield and quality of harvested potatoes, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to support pest management programs
in potato growing States. Such programs help scientists track po-
tential pest outbreaks and provide growers and industry profes-
sionals with current information on specific and timely treatments.
Additionally, these programs help identify serious diseases, such as
late blight disease, in their early stages, allowing for preventive
measures to be put in place quickly to avoid crop losses.
Requests for Applications and Obligation of Awards.—The Com-
mittee is concerned by NIFA’s delays in issuing fiscal year 2025
Requests for Applications and subsequent grant awards. The Com-
mittee directs NIFA to report to the Committee within 30 days of
enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter on the expected
timeline of fiscal year 2026 Requests for Applications and award
announcements for each program.
Specialty Crop Research Initiative.—The Committee emphasizes
the important role of the Specialty Crop Research Initiative in ad-
dressing the critical needs of the specialty crop industry through
research and extension activities. The Committee encourages NIFA
to prioritize proposals for, and enhance its overall commitment to
the ability of farmers to extend their growing season through the
use of winter growing techniques, including but not limited to high
tunnel vegetable production. The Committee also encourages NIFA
to support research that would boost mechanization and automa-
tion of labor-intensive tasks in specialty crop production and proc-
essing.
Stray Voltage and Dairy Cattle Health.—The Committee is aware
of concerns from dairy producers and limited research regarding
the potential impact of stray voltage on animal health and milk
production. The Committee encourages NIFA to support research
into the prevalence, detection, and effects of stray voltage on dairy
cattle with the aim of improving diagnostic methods, assessing ani-
43
mal behavior and productivity, and evaluating mitigation strate-
gies.
Supplemental and Alternative Crops.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of nationally coordinated, regionally managed
canola research and extension programs. The Committee encour-
ages the Secretary to continue to seek input from stakeholders and
to give priority consideration to proposals in the peer review proc-
ess that address research needs in production areas with the great-
est potential to expand, as well as those where canola production
is established and needs to be maintained.
Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education [SARE].—The
Committee appreciates the work SARE has done to improve soil
health through cutting edge research, education, and extension on
cover crops, diversified rotations, and managed grazing. The Com-
mittee expects the funding provided to be focused on increasing ag-
ricultural resilience, including, where appropriate, interdisciplinary
systems research and education, farmer and rancher research and
demonstration grants, and graduate student research grants.
NATIVE AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS ENDOWMENT FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $11,880,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 11,880,000
The Native American Institutions Endowment Fund, authorized
by the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act (Public Law
103–382), provides an endowment for the 1994 land-grant institu-
tions (34 tribally-controlled colleges). This program enhances edu-
cational opportunity for Native Americans by building educational
capacity at these institutions in the areas of student recruitment
and retention, curricula development, faculty preparation, instruc-
tion delivery systems, and scientific instrumentation for teaching.
Income funds are also available for facility renovation, repair, con-
struction, and maintenance. On the termination of each fiscal year,
the Secretary shall withdraw the income from the endowment fund
for the fiscal year, and, after making adjustments for the cost of
administering the endowment fund, distribute the adjusted income
as follows: 60 percent of the adjusted income from these funds shall
be distributed among the 1994 land-grant institutions on a pro rata
basis, the proportionate share being based on the Indian student
count; and 40 percent of the adjusted income shall be distributed
in equal shares to the 1994 land-grant institutions.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $11,880,000 for
the Native American Institutions Endowment Fund.
EXTENSION ACTIVITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $561,700,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 561,700,000
Cooperative extension work was established by the Smith-Lever
Act of May 8, 1914, as amended (Public Law 63–95). USDA is au-
thorized to provide, through the land-grant colleges, cooperative ex-
tension work that consists of the development of practical applica-
tions of research knowledge and the giving of instruction and prac-
44
tical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or tech-
nologies in agriculture and related subjects, and to encourage the
application of such information by demonstrations, publications,
through 4–H clubs, and other means to persons not in attendance
or resident at the colleges.
To fulfill the requirements of the Smith-Lever Act (Public Law
63–95), State and county extension offices in each State, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American
Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and Micronesia conduct edu-
cational programs to improve American agriculture and strengthen
the Nation’s families and communities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $561,700,000 for

Cooperative Extension System.—The Committee recognizes the
essential function that extension plays in ensuring that farmers,
45
ranchers, and communities of all sizes are empowered to meet the
challenges they face, adapt to changing technology and a changing
climate, improve nutrition and food safety, prepare for and respond
to emergencies, and protect our environment. The Committee is
concerned that the Federal investment in this critical Federal,
State, and local partnership has lagged in recent years, just as ex-
traordinary stresses have been placed on farmers, ranchers, rural
businesses, and communities.
Extension Design Initiative.—The Committee recognizes that for
decades, the foundation of traditional farm extension programs had
researchers and educators working on the farms and fields along-
side crop and livestock producers, but that changes are needed to
develop a 21st century extension to meet the needs of today’s farm-
ers. The Committee notes that new efforts require USDA to use
high-performance computing to develop, test, and deploy new dig-
ital infrastructure and platforms that can translate research into
real-time interactive feedback, online modeling, demonstration, and
simulations. The Committee directs NIFA to conduct meetings with
producers, stakeholders, and policymakers to begin developing a
framework for the next generation of farm extension programs.
Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network.—The Committee
recognizes the farmers, ranchers, and individuals working in agri-
culture who face highly stressful working conditions. NIFA is en-
couraged to coordinate with the Department of Health and Human
Services, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration to assess the feasibility of a national farmer
and farm worker crisis line. Within 180 days of enactment of this
act, NIFA is directed to provide a report detailing the program’s
evolution since inception, types of programming provided, and
FRSAN’s strategy for continuing outreach and services.
Minority Outreach.—The Committee is concerned that extension
service resources do not reach minority, socially disadvantaged,
and Tribal communities in proportion to their participation in the
agricultural sector. All institutions that receive extension funding
should seek to ensure that an equitable percentage of their overall
extension work reaches minority, socially disadvantaged, and Trib-
al communities. The Committee directs NIFA to evaluate distribu-
tion of extension resources to these three populations and report to
the Committee no later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program [VMLRP].—The
Committee recognizes the importance of the VMLRP in meeting the
needs of rural ranchers, farmers, and rural communities across the
country by incentivizing licensed veterinarians to practice in
USDA-designated veterinary shortage areas. Within 90 days of en-
actment of this act and quarterly thereafter, NIFA is directed to
provide a report to the Committee on the number of declared short-
age areas, by State, and how many positions, by shortage area, re-
main unfilled.

Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative.—The Committee sup-
ports the important work being done through the publicly funded
diagnostic laboratory network and encourages NIFA to prioritize
funding to strengthen animal health diagnostic laboratories, taking
into consideration the following: the degree to which the capacity
for surveillance, monitoring, response, and capacity is enhanced;
the concentration of human and animal populations that are di-
rectly at risk; trade, tourism, and cultural considerations; geog-
raphy, ecology, and climate; evidence of active collaboration with
and support of the State animal health officials; those States with
highest risk for the introduction of foreign and emerging pests and
diseases; and evidence of stakeholder support and engagement.

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,147,750,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,167,534,000
The Secretary of Agriculture established the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service on April 2, 1972, under the authority of
reorganization plan No. 2 of 1953, and other authorities. The major
objectives of APHIS are to protect the animal and plant resources
of the Nation from diseases and pests. These objectives are carried
out under the major areas of activity, as follows:
Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response.—The
agency monitors plant and animal health worldwide and sets im-
port polices to prevent the introduction of foreign plant and animal
pests and diseases. Domestically, the agency works cooperatively to
conduct plant and animal health monitoring programs, pursue
eradication, or limit the spread of the threat. The agency also con-
ducts diagnostic laboratory activities that support disease preven-
tion, detection, control, and eradication programs. In addition, the
agency protects agriculture from detrimental animal predators and
through its regulatory structure helps advance genetic research
while protecting against the release of harmful organisms.
Safe Trade and International Technical Assistance.—The agency
helps resolve technical trade issues to ensure the smooth and safe
movement of agricultural commodities into and out of the United
States. The agency negotiates animal and plant health certification
requirements and assists U.S. exporters in meeting foreign regu-
latory demands. In addition, the agency assists developing coun-
tries in improving their safeguarding systems to protect the United
States from emerging plant and animal pests and diseases.
Animal Care.—The agency conducts regulatory activities that en-
sure the humane care and treatment of animals and horses as re-
quired by the Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 89–544) and Horse
Protection Acts (Public Law 91–540). These activities include in-
spection of certain establishments that handle animals intended for
research, exhibition, and as pets, and monitoring certain horse
shows.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,167,534,000
for salaries and expenses of the Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service [APHIS], including $11,384,000 for Congressionally Di-
rected Spending.
The following table reflects the Committee’s specific rec-
ommendations for APHIS:

Agricultural Quarantine Inspection.—The Committee recognizes
that the prevention of infestations of pests and diseases is signifi-
cantly more cost effective than subsequent control or eradication.
This is an important Federal responsibility, and the Committee
provides $35,500,000 for the agricultural quarantine inspections
[AQI] function, including pre-departure and interline inspections,
and canine detection and surveillance activities.
Animal Product Imports.—APHIS Animal Products Import and
Export division is responsible for keeping the U.S. safe from foreign
animal disease while also promoting trade through negotiating
science based health certificates and procedures with foreign gov-
ernments to enhance U.S. agriculture exports. The Committee
maintains funding consistent with fiscal year 2024 levels to support
the APHIS Animal Products Import and Export activities, includ-
ing sanitary and phytosanitary issues that arise between U.S. for-
eign governments and export destinations.
Animal Welfare.—The Committee is concerned about APHIS’
Animal Care program and the steep decline in enforcement related
to violations of the Animal Welfare Act urges the agency to reform
its current licensing and enforcement scheme. While the agency
has taken steps towards this goal, the Committee believes more
progress can be made. This includes, but is not limited to: ensuring
consistent, thorough, unannounced inspections on a regular basis;
ensuring each failure to allow access for inspection and each viola-
tion or failure to comply with animal welfare standards is docu-
mented on an inspection report; and, requiring that inspection re-
ports which identify violations or failures of compliance be shared
with relevant local, State, and Federal agencies.
The Committee continues to encourage APHIS to use its full en-
forcement capabilities under the AWA against chronic violators of
the AWA. The Committee directs the agency to update the Com-
mittee within 60 days of enactment of the act on AWA enforcement
activities, including the number of cases referred to the Office of
the General Counsel, the Department of Justice, or both, when ap-
propriate. The Secretary of Agriculture shall continue the March
2024 memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Attorney Gen-
eral to encourage greater collaboration on Animal Welfare Act en-
forcement and ensure that the Department of Justice has access to
evidence needed to initiate cases.
50
In July 2023, USDA announced an independent review of the
Animal Care program by a third-party entity. The Committee urges
the Secretary to ensure that next phase of the review—stakeholder
analysis—includes input from Congress and expert animal protec-
tion organizations, and that APHIS continues to strengthen its
AWA enforcement efforts while this review is underway.
Chronic Wasting Disease [CWD].—The Committee is concerned
about the growing threat of CWD and its impact on wild and
farmed deer populations. As such, the Committee provides APHIS
$22,500,000 for CWD related activities. Specifically, of the amount
provided for cervid health activities, $12,500,000 shall be for
APHIS to allocate funds directly to State departments of wildlife,
State departments of agriculture, Native American Tribes, and re-
search institutions and universities to further develop and imple-
ment CWD surveillance, testing, management, and response activi-
ties, and $5,000,000 shall be for indemnity payments and associ-
ated costs to remove infected and exposed animals as expeditiously
as possible. Of the amount provided for Wildlife Service Methods
Development, $5,000,000 shall be for CWD work at the National
Wildlife Research Center, and the Committee directs APHIS to con-
tinue working with university collaborators to provide research
support to the overall effort to detect, combat, and control CWD.
Cogongrass Management and Control.—The Committee main-
tains the fiscal year 2025 level to assist States with cogongrass
management and control efforts.
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under APHIS.
While the Committee has provided the funding, recipients of CDS
are still required to apply for the funding. The Committee expects
the agency to review the applications and fund projects in the same
manner as in previous years.
Contingency Fund..—The term ‘contingency fund’ as referenced
in the APHIS table shall be defined as a source of funding avail-
able for the control of outbreaks of insects, plant diseases, animal
diseases and for control of pest animals and birds.
Crop Threat Assessment.—The Committee directs APHIS to de-
liver a report that assesses the threats to crops on the U.S. main-
land from agricultural pests and diseases from Central and South
America and the Asia Pacific region within 180 days of enactment
of this act. The report should include an identification of how pests
from these regions usually reach the U.S. mainland, and a descrip-
tion of how the Department prevents the introduction of new pests
from these regions.
Electronic Identification Tags.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the electronic identification tags for certain cattle
and bison moving across state lines for disease traceability. The
Committee includes $13,500,000 for APHIS to procure and dis-
tribute the requisite number of tags associated with the implemen-
tation of this rule, including brucellosis EID tags for States in and
surrounding the Greater Yellowstone Area. APHIS is directed to
provide the Committee an update on the use of these funds within
90 days of enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter.
Equine Health Activities.—The Committee provides $2,450,000
for equine health activities, of which $250,000 shall be used to sup-
51
port ongoing cooperative agreements with States impacted by East-
ern Equine Encephalitis that received funding in fiscal year 2024.
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza [HPAI].—The Committee re-
mains concerned with the spread of highly pathogenic avian influ-
enza and appreciates the Department’s ongoing efforts to contain
spread of the virus. The Committee encourages the Department to
continue coordination with State animal health officials in order to
proactively mitigate spread of the virus. The Committee also urges
the Department to increase outreach and engagement with poultry
producers to educate on proactive measures individuals can take to
further mitigate the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
Additionally, the Committee recognizes the extreme economic
hardship posed to gamebird and egg farmers when flocks are deter-
mined to be infected by high and low pathogenic avian influenza
and acknowledges the severe limitations on controlled marketing
available to producers of live game birds, as well as the income loss
from egg production. The Committee encourages APHIS to provide
full indemnity coverage for gamebird and egg operations and cease
attempts to limit coverage. The Committee directs the Secretary to
provide a report within 90 days of enactment of this act regarding
the economic impact of avian influenza on the whole gamebird sup-
ply chain, including small businesses and preserve customers, and
proposals for insurance or indemnity options for the impacted busi-
nesses and preserves.
While the Committee agrees that the transfer of CCC funds to
APHIS to address HPAI was warranted to continue to address the
ongoing outbreak among poultry and the transmission to dairy cat-
tle, to ensure that these funds are used effectively, APHIS is di-
rected to brief the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this
act and monthly thereafter on the use of these funds. This brief
shall include both budgetary and operational data on APHIS’ ef-
forts to address HPAI in both dairy cattle and poultry, com-
plemented with a monthly HPAI obligation report, progress update
on APHIS’ 5-pronged strategy to combat HPAI, as well as how
APHIS is working with other Federal partners such as the Centers
for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration, and
State and local entities.
Horse Protection.—The Committee provides no less than the fis-
cal year 2024 level for enforcement of the Horse Protection Act of
1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1831), and reminds the Secretary that
Congress granted the agency primary responsibility to enforce this
law, including the training of all inspectors. The Committee directs
APHIS to ensure that all official warning letters, administrative
complaints, stipulations, and consent decisions are made publicly
available in a searchable format, consistent with 7 U.S.C. 2146a.
Inspection of Research Facilities.—The Committee is aware that
Veterinary Medical Officers [VMOs] and Improved Training for In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committees [IACUC] members
play a significant role in the administration of animal protection
programs at research facilities. Therefore, proper training of such
personnel is essential. The Committee directs APHIS to provide on-
demand, publicly available training for IACUC members and
VMOs on how to perform adequate inspections of research facili-
ties. The training should inform VMOs and IACUC members, as
52
relevant to their respective roles in providing oversight of research
facilities, how to review, monitor, and approve research facilities’
protocols; verify the accuracy of annual reports submitted by re-
search facilities to confirm the correct number of animals used in
every experiment and that animals are reported in the correct pain
category; and review and monitor experiments performed on ani-
mals by research facilities to ensure the humane care and use of
animals in compliance with the AWA and IACUC-approved proto-
cols.
APHIS shall report to the Committee on an annual basis about
the trainings it has offered to VMOs and IACUC members on how
to perform adequate research facility inspections. In addition, all
training materials used and distributed by APHIS should be pub-
licly accessible online.
Lacey Act Implementation.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3371–3378) in addressing traf-
ficking of illegally taken wildlife, fish, and plants, including illegal
deforestation activities. The Committee provides no less than the
fiscal year 2024 level to support the implementation of the Lacey
Act within the Safe Trade and International Technical Assistance
program. APHIS is directed to submit a report within 180 days of
enactment of this act outlining potential ways to address all out-
standing plant and wood product categories covered by the 2008
Amendment to the Lacey Act.
Los Alamitos Sterile Insect Release Facility.—The Committee
urges APHIS and local and State cooperators to develop a com-
prehensive plan for much needed facility enhancements at the Ster-
ile Insect Release Facility in Los Alamitos, California.
Marine Mammals in Captivity.—The Committee is concerned
that USDA’s handling, care, treatment, and transportation stand-
ards for marine mammals in captivity are outdated. Marine mam-
mal science has progressed significantly in the almost 40 years
since the most important of these regulations were last updated,
and the current standards do not adequately protect the welfare of
captive marine mammals. The Committee directs APHIS to
prioritize the development and finalization of a humane and
science-based rule to modernize its marine mammal regulations
and directs the agency to report back within 90 days of enactment
of this Act on its progress in achieving that goal.
National Animal Health Laboratory Network.—The Committee
provides no less than the fiscal year 2024 level for the National
Animal Health Laboratory Network.
National Aquatic Animal Health Plan.—The Committee provides
no less than the fiscal year 2025 level to support the continued im-
plementation of the 2025–2027 National Aquaculture Health Plan
and the Comprehensive Aquaculture Health Program Standards.
National Bio- and Agro-Defense Human Capital Development.—
The Committee provides $3,000,000 for APHIS to ensure necessary
steps are taken to develop a qualified workforce comprised of sub-
ject matter experts in foreign, emerging, and zoonotic diseases and
capable of developing, validating, and conducting needed
diagnostics, performing epidemiologic studies, and completing
bioinformatics analyses. The Committee encourages APHIS to es-
tablish cooperative agreements with academic research institu-
53
tions, particularly non-land grant Hispanic-Serving Institutions, to
support the next generation of the NBAF workforce, including fa-
cilities and equipment.
National Detector Dog Training Center.—The Committee sup-
ports the work of the National Detector Dog Training Center in
protecting the domestic agriculture sector from invasive pests and
diseases. The Committee requests USDA, within 1 year after enact-
ment of this act, to submit a report to Congress regarding the Cen-
ter’s role in protecting the domestic agriculture sector from pests
and diseases. The Committee requests that the report include a de-
scription of domestic pest and disease programs that use canine de-
tector teams, coordination between APHIS and U.S. Customs and
Border Protection on use of canine teams for agricultural quar-
antine inspections, and the Center’s current capacity level.
Additionally, the Committee encourages USDA Animal Plant
Health Inspection Service to consider and prioritize the growing
use of canine teams nationally and within territories of the U.S. by
exploring ways to expand the number of canine detection training
facilities across the country, to include areas on the West Coast
with high detection needs.
National Clean Plant Network.—APHIS is directed to allocate no
less than fiscal year 2025 levels to the National Clean Plant Net-
work.
National Veterinary Stockpile.—The Committee provides
$6,250,000 for the National Veterinary Stockpile to protect the Na-
tion’s food supply by maintaining enough countermeasures capable
of deployment against the most damaging animal diseases. The
Committee urges USDA to continue to stock and make available
U.S-manufactured reusable respirators in the National Veterinary
Stockpile [NVS]. Doing so is critical to support the availability of
tools that can protect Federal and State emergency responders. Re-
usable respirators provide enhanced protection and have a longer
shelf-life compared to disposable masks like N95s. Stockpiled ac-
cess to reusable respirators during a crisis can pre-empt shortages
that result from high demand or supply chain disruptions. The
Committee emphasizes the critical need to protect all Federal and
State animal disease emergency responders from infectious agents.
Navel Orangeworm.—The Committee recognizes the challenges
the navel orangeworm poses to tree nut production and provides no
less than fiscal year 2024 levels to continue managing the pest. Ad-
ditionally, the Committee encourages APHIS to partner with com-
modity organizations or private companies to combat navel
orangeworm by developing alternatives to traditional irradiation
sterile insect technique, including genetic engineering.
New World Screwworm.—The Committee is concerned by the
rapidly growing New World Screwworm [NWS] infestation in Mex-
ico and Central America, which threatens to infect our domestic
livestock industry. The Committee recognizes that past efforts to
eradicate this parasite in the United States were very costly, and
if an infestation were to occur within our borders today the burden
on taxpayers and private industry to eradicate would be far costlier
still. The Committee supports efforts by the Department to provide
the sterile insects necessary to prevent and control NWS and en-
courages the Department to construct a new sterile fly facility in
54
the United States to provide the sterile insects necessary to pre-
vent and control NWS.
Nitrogen-Based Deopopulation Methods.—The Committee directs
the USDA to continue to utilize available funds through the Na-
tional Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program to fa-
cilitate and invest in research and development of large-scale de-
population technologies, including whole house gassing with nitro-
gen and high expansion nitrogen gas-filled foam as methods of
large-scale depopulation during animal disease emergency response
events. Further, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide a
report to the Committee within 90 days on inclusion of the method
in the American Veterinarian Medical Association [AVMA] Depopu-
lation Guidelines and on the barriers to widespread use of nitro-
gen-based depopulation methods during animal disease emergency
response events.
Non-Lethal Strategies.—The Committee is aware that Wildlife
Services has worked with landowners to deploy non-lethal strate-
gies, such as fladry, electric fencing, and livestock guardian dogs,
to reduce predator depredation on livestock. The Committee pro-
vides $5,000,000 for Wildlife Services to hire personnel exclusively
to promote and implement non-lethal human-predator conflict de-
terrence techniques in interested States, with a focus on reducing
human-wildlife conflicts related to predators and beavers in the
Western Region and Great Lakes States and to assist in providing
training in these techniques to agricultural producers, landowners,
and other agency personnel in collaboration with the National
Wildlife Research Center.
Additionally, APHIS is directed to provide an annual report with-
in 120 days of the end of the fiscal year, detailing how these addi-
tional funds were dispersed; including regional distribution, wild
and domestic species impacted, number and size of livestock/agri-
cultural operations impacted, and nonlethal tools and methods im-
plemented and supported.
Online Dog Dealers.—The Committee is concerned about the lack
of enforcement of the law with respect to online dog dealers and
other types of pet dealers, which has allowed many online oper-
ations to continue selling puppies without the necessary USDA li-
censing under the Animal Welfare Act. The Secretary is directed to
prioritize the enforcement of the 2013 rule that requires that deal-
ers who APHIS has determined to be selling animals sight-unseen
to consumers must have the necessary license to do so.
Paraguayan Beef.—The Committee is concerned with the poten-
tial reintroduction of FMD and the devastation that would cause
our domestic cattle producers. Within 30 days of enactment of this
act, APHIS shall perform an updated risk analysis to determine
the safety of fresh (chilled or frozen) beef imports from Paraguay.
As part of this analysis, APHIS shall conduct at least one addi-
tional site visit to Paraguay to verify the data collected. In addi-
tion, the Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a working group:
(1) to evaluate the threat posed by beef and beef products imported
from Paraguay to food safety and animal health in the United
States; (2) to report on the most recent disease data and conduct
additional research on the threat to food safety and animal health;
and (3) to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to
55
whether the importation of beef and beef products from Paraguay
into the United States should be permitted. The Secretary shall en-
sure that the working group includes: (1) experts on food safety; (2)
experts on animal health; and (3) representatives of U.S. Customs
and Border Protection and other Federal agencies with responsibil-
ities relating to international trade.
Pathogen Transmission Reduction for Agricultural Producers.—
The Committee is concerned about the current and potential future
impacts of H5N1 influenza and other biological threats to agri-
culture, and the needs of producers in protecting livestock from
these threats. The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture,
in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices, the Environmental Protection Agency, and agricultural pro-
ducers, to conduct an assessment of pathogen transmission reduc-
tion needs in farm facilities that house and process livestock to pro-
tect animals and humans from the spread of zoonotic diseases.
These structures include, but are not limited to poultry barns,
dairy barns and milking parlors, and swine barns. The assessment
should determine minimum air quality standards for reducing
pathogen transmission among livestock and agricultural workers.
The assessment should also identify and detail the methods for en-
hancing indoor air quality in these facilities and associated costs.
The Secretary shall fund this assessment using borrowing author-
ity from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Secretary shall
submit this assessment to Congress no later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act, and make the assessment publicly accessible
digitally, such as on a website or online portal.
Poultry Indemnity Payments.—The Committee directs USDA to
coordinate amongst all relevant agencies under its authority to up-
date, and where applicable, develop consistent, easily replicated
formulas on an annual basis to estimate market values of livestock
and poultry categories for indemnity purposes. In developing and
updating these annual values, USDA should ensure that they re-
flect applicable modern production practices, and relevant livestock
and poultry markets so that payments by USDA represent average
fair market values for the category of animal that the compensa-
tion payment is intended to cover.
Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Program.—The
Committee recognizes the importance of APHIS’ Rangeland Grass-
hopper and Mormon Cricket Program and includes an increase of
$500,000 to administer this program. APHIS is encouraged to ad-
minister these funds based on need and infestation severity rather
than on a first-come, first-serve basis due the season variation of
grasshopper infestations across the West.
Roseau Cane.—The Committee remains concerned with the
invasive species scale insect pest that is destroying Roseau cane in
the Mississippi River’s Delta region along the Gulf of Mexico. An
estimated 225,000 acres of wetlands in the Delta have been af-
fected with the die-off, and Roseau cane is important in maintain-
ing a healthy marsh and preventing erosion. The Committee di-
rects APHIS to work with ARS and stakeholders and provides no
less than the fiscal year 2025 level to develop an integrated man-
agement program for control of the Roseau cane scale insect pest
infestation.

Rotary Fleet.—The Committee recognizes the increasing demands
on the aging APHIS Wildlife Services rotary aircraft fleet to assist
the agricultural and livestock sectors. The Committee directs
APHIS to submit a report assessing the fleet’s current status and
future rotary aircraft needs to operate efficiently and effectively to
the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate no
later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this act.
Soring.—The Committee has consistently recognized the need for
the equine industry and APHIS to cooperate in order to eliminate
the soring of horses. In 2021, the National Academy of Sciences
[NAS] recognized the importance of continuing to develop an objec-
tive science-based inspection to ensure accuracy and fairness. The
Committee directs APHIS to continue swabbing and other proven
objective science-based inspection techniques for its horse soring in-
spection protocol and to address remaining findings of the NAS re-
port as the agency deems warranted.
Sudden Oak Death.—The European strain 1 [EU1] and the
North American strain 1 [NA1] of the sudden oak death pathogen
are major threats to western Douglas-fir/tanoak forests, resulting
in quarantine restrictions that threaten U.S. forests and export
markets for log shipments and lily bulbs. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2024 funding
level to improve understanding of EU1 and NA1 strains of the sud-
den oak death pathogen and treatment methods to inform control
and management techniques in wildlands.
Twenty-Eight Hour Law.—The Committee is concerned that the
regular feeding, watering, and rest required, by 49 U.S.C. 80502,
to be provided by animal carriers is not being effectively enforced.
The Committee still awaits the report on barriers to successful im-
plementation of this law.
Wildlife Damage Management.—APHIS is responsible for pro-
viding Federal leadership in managing problems caused by wildlife.
The Committee provides $123,500,000 for wildlife damage control
to maintain priority initiatives, including preventing the transport
of invasive snakes and other harmful species. The Committee pro-
vides $500,000 for the agency to reduce blackbird depredation in
the Northern Great Plains.
The Committee maintains support for assistance to catfish pro-
ducers to help mitigate wildlife depredation, particularly as it per-
tains to fish-eating and disease-carrying birds. The Committee pro-
vides no less than the fiscal year 2025 level for damage manage-
ment efforts and the development of methods to assist producers in
combatting the persistent threat and economic hardship caused by
cormorants, pelicans, and other birds.
The Committee recognizes the importance of the National Feral
Swine Damage Management Program in reducing adverse ecologi-
cal and economic impacts caused by feral swine across the country
and encourages the use of all approved measures as a force multi-
plier and to prioritize areas with the most populous swine popu-
lation.
The Committee directs APHIS to provide within 90 days of en-
actment of this act, and annually thereafter, a report to include the
state, most utilized methods, and most common reasons for lethal
57
removal of beavers on private and Federal land by the APHIS and
its partners.
The Committee provides $29,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000,
for the National Rabies Management Program to fortify existing
barriers and advance prevention and eradication efforts.
Wildlife Services Cost Share.—The Committee is concerned about
the increasing inequitable Federal amount of cost share in coopera-
tive service agreements between APHIS–Wildlife Services and/or
political subdivisions of States responsible for Wildlife Service pro-
grams that protect agriculture, property, human life, and natural
resources. The Committee expects Wildlife Services to strive for an
equitable 50/50 cost share to the extent that funding is available
to do so.
Wildlife Services Education and Training.—The Committee is
aware of the wide range of hazardous procedures and materials uti-
lized by APHIS personnel in the conduct of daily duties. In addi-
tion, a recent comprehensive study noted the critical need to pro-
vide standardized safety training, certification, and database man-
agement for tracking to ensure the safest working environment
possible. As such, the Committee provides $2,000,000 within Wild-
life Damage Management to maintain a National Training Acad-
emy focused on those areas of greatest concern such as pyrotech-
nics, firearms, hazardous materials, immobilization and euthanasia
drugs, pesticides, animal care and handling, land vehicles,
watercraft, and zoonotic diseases.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,000,000
The APHIS appropriation for Buildings and Facilities funds
major nonrecurring construction projects in support of specific pro-
gram activities and recurring construction, alterations, preventive
maintenance, and repairs of existing APHIS facilities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommendation includes an appropriation of
$1,000,000 for buildings and facilities of the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
This funding is necessary to allow APHIS to maintain existing
facilities and perform critically needed repairs to and replacements
of building components, such as heating, ventilation, and air-condi-
tioning on a prioritized basis at APHIS facilities. The Committee
notes that due to the environmentally sensitive nature of many
APHIS facilities, closure of a facility could result if APHIS is un-
able to complete the required repairs.
AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SERVICE
MARKETING SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $222,887,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 222,887,000
The Agricultural Marketing Service was established by the Sec-
retary of Agriculture on April 2, 1972. AMS carries out programs
58
authorized by more than 50 different statutory authorities, the pri-
mary ones being the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C.
1621–1627, 1635–1638); the U.S. Cotton Standards Act (7 U.S.C.
51–65); the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act (7 U.S.C. 471–476);

ricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499a–499t); the Egg Products
Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031–1056); and section 32 of the act of
1935 (Public Law 74–320, 7 U.S.C. 612c).
Programs administered by this agency include the market news
services, standardization, grading, classing, shell egg surveillance
services, transportation services, wholesale farmers and alternative
market development, grant payments to States for marketing ac-
tivities, the Federal administration of marketing agreements and
orders, commodity purchases, the Perishable Agricultural Commod-
ities Act (7 U.S.C. 499a–499t), the Plant Variety Protection Act
(Public Law 71–325), and market protection and promotion activi-
ties.

Cattle Contract Library.—Smaller cattle producers often find
themselves to be price takers in the market for fed cattle and lack
the volume of large producers to negotiate unique and advan-
tageous marketing agreements with large meatpackers. The Cattle
Contracts Library helps bring transparency into the marketplace.
59
Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives.—The Committee is con-
cerned about the uptake of existing resources directed to dairy
farmers for the purpose of mitigating the spread of highly patho-
genic avian influenza in dairy cows. The Committee urges AMS to
direct Commodity Credit Corporation investments into innovative
and existing dairy programs that capture both dairy farmers and
dairy processors through the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives.
Dairy Sanitary Export Certificate Software.—The Committee is
concerned with the USDA dairy sanitary export certificate program
software ATLAS has caused US dairy exporters significant export
delays and detentions in foreign ports. USDA is directed to report
to the Committee on the status of its improvements to the ATLAS
program including reporting on the quantity errors in certificates
issued by the end of this fiscal year and to include in such report,
status of Department and AMS funding from existing and relevant
funds, such as CCC funds, and if necessary, inclusion within the
Department’s fiscal year 2027 budget request.
Domestic Shrimp.—The Committee is concerned that the domes-
tic shrimp fishing and processing industry is on the brink of col-
lapse due to the overproduction and oversupply of imported shrimp
to the U.S and global markets at unprecedented levels. The Com-
mittee recognizes that this surplus of imported shrimp in U.S. in-
ventory has driven prices offered to U.S. shrimp fishermen to his-
torically low levels that fall below that which can sustain shrimp
fishing operations. The Committee is also aware that a substantial
portion of the U.S. shrimp fishing fleet remains tied to the dock
and many small, family-owned shrimp businesses are going out of
business. To help reduce this unprecedented surplus of shrimp in
the U.S. market, the Committee encourages AMS to maximize its

Section 5:
section 32 program purchases of domestic warm-water shrimp.
Dry Edible Beans.—The Committee is aware that dry edible
beans are an important part of a nutritious and well-balanced diet.
However, the Committee is concerned that dry edible beans have
not played an adequate role in addressing nutrition needs under
U.S. international food aid programs as well as domestic feeding
programs and encourages the Department to enhance the amount
and frequency of dry edible bean purchases for use in such pro-
grams.
Equivalency Agreements.—The Committee is concerned that
there have been imports of critical foods, including infant formula,
that do not meet equivalency agreements made with other coun-
tries. Within 90 days of the enactment of this act, the Committee
directs AMS to provide a report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions in the House and Senate that touches on changes to all exist-
ing Equivalency Agreements that would need to be made in order
to be in compliance with the 2022 Origin of Livestock Rule. The
Committee also directs AMS to provide a list within the report to
the Committees of infant formula products that do not meet the
2022 Origin of Livestock Rule. To ensure that the industry is com-
pliant with the 2022 Origin of Livestock Rule, AMS is directed to
post the report publicly within 30 days of transmitting the report
to the Committees and is also directed to provide copies of the re-
port to the Food and Drug Administration and the Customs and
Border Protection.
60
Honey.—The Committee directs the department to provide a re-
port on the necessary resources and authorities needed to ensure
a fairer market for domestic honey producers and more transparent
market for American consumers. The Department is encouraged to
collaborate with Customs and Border Protection, the Food and
Drug Administration, and domestic commercial honey producer
stakeholders.
Local Agriculture Market Program.—The Committee continues to
urge the Department to simplify the application and reporting
process for the Local Agriculture Market Program. The Committee
is aware AMS implemented a turnkey grant application in fiscal
year 2023 for Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Grants
but that applications were restricted to specific project types, and
the list was not inclusive of common needs in direct marketing and
intermediary local market settings. The Committee encourages the
agency to expand the turnkey application to include other common
activities, including vendor and customer outreach activities, farm-
ers market manager staff time, regional food chain coordination,
and special purpose equipment.
Local Meat Processing.—The Committee recognizes and supports
investments in local meat processing. These investments are an op-
portunity to combat agricultural market concentration and increase
market access for American farmers and ranchers. The Committee
directs the Department to submit a report to the Committee within
90 days of enactment of this act that includes the total amount of
Federal investments made in local meat processing across depart-
mental programs, the current status of plants receiving funding,
whether the Department has reviewed any potential sales of plants
receiving funding, and, to the extent practicable, an assessment of
the economic impact of departmental programs on local meat proc-
essing.
Local Food Procurement.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of strengthening local and regional food systems to enhance
food security, support producers, and stimulate rural economies.
The Committee directs the Department to work in coordination
with State agencies, Tribal governments, local educational authori-
ties, and emergency food providers, including food banks and pan-
tries, to facilitate the use of Federal nutrition and food assistance
funds-including but not limited to funds under the Child Nutrition
Programs, The Emergency Food Assistance Program [TEFAP] (in-
cluding TEFAP Fresh Produce Box Program), Food Distribution
Program on Indian Reservations [FDPIR] and the Commodity Sup-
plemental Food Program [CSFP]—for the direct purchase of food
from small and mid-sized local and regional producers. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department of Defense Logistics Agency,
USDA Agricultural Marketing Service [AMS] and Food and Nutri-
tion Service to review current practices to identify opportunities to
increase local food purchases in the DoD Fresh and the Fresh Fruit
and Vegetable Program. The committee encourages the Depart-
ment to use best value evaluation criteria, other flexibilities within
the Federal Acquisition Regulations [FAR] including local set-
asides, to add language to the AMS agency supplement to the FAR
prioritizing local purchasing, and to streamline administrative re-
quirements to ensure highest quality food purchases and opportuni-
61
ties for local and regional procurement. USDA should collaborate
with State agencies (and their associations) to share local pur-
chasing best practices and to ensure that institutions and providers
can easily identify and procure from local producers. The Com-
mittee further directs USDA (Economic Research Service in co-
operation with the Office of Contracts and Procurement, Agricul-
tural Marketing Service and Food and Nutrition Service) to report
within 180 days of enactment of this act on barriers to local pro-
curement, pathways to overcome the barriers, and recommenda-
tions to enhance access to and affordability of locally grown foods
across nutrition assistance programs.
Meat Pricing Concerns.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of ensuring that meat pricing mechanisms are transparent
and provide reliable price discovery for cattle producers and the
rest of the supply chain nationwide. The Committee notes that the
Nation’s food supply chain is an issue of national security, and em-
phasizes that our farmers, ranchers, processors, and consumers
must have a fair and competitive marketplace. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary, to analyze these issues including economic dis-
ruptions associated with public health emergencies.
Micro-Grants for Food Security.—The Committee urges AMS to
administer the Micro-Grants for Food Security program in a man-
ner that will ensure that low-income, disadvantaged, and minority
individuals are able to submit applications and receive funding for
projects such as animal processing and slaughter facilities, includ-
ing reindeer herders, greenhouses, and hydroponic growing facili-
ties that would increase the amount and quality of locally produced
foods. When practicable, the Committee directs AMS to waive or
amend how it applies the regulatory requirements of 2 CFR

Section 6:
200.206, 200.313, 200.328, and 200.329 to ensure that this program
addresses food insecurity challenges.
National Organic Program.—The Committee recognizes that or-
ganic regulations are a valuable market development tool for U.S.
agriculture and provides no less than the fiscal year 2025 level for
the National Organic Program [NOP]. A healthy market for organic
products requires a clear product distinction backed by a trusted,
verified, and consistently enforced label. The Committee also recog-
nizes that regular updates to the regulations are crucial. The Com-
mittee directs USDA to provide all resources needed for the NOP
to deliver the strongest possible oversight before allowing the
USDA organic seal to be granted to domestic and international op-
erations and products, including a continued focus on proactive
risk-based investigations and oversight, enhanced training for cer-
tifiers, and practice standards development. In addition, within 60
days of enactment of this act, AMS is directed to provide a full re-
port outlining the breakdown of the National Organic Program’s
key expenditures such as compliance and enforcement activities,
practice standards development, and technology upgrades.
Native American Foods and Tourism.—The Committee recog-
nizes that enhanced Native American tourism creates important
job opportunities in Native American communities while show-
casing their heritage, food, traditions, history, and continuing vital-
ity. The Committee encourages USDA to support the Native Amer-
ican Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience Act (Public Law
62
114–221) by prioritizing projects that market, promote, or expand
Native American foods, markets, and enterprises.
Organic Dairy.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
consumer confidence in the integrity of the USDA Organic Seal and
notes the work that USDA has done to increase training and cer-
tifier consistency with respect to dairy operations. The Committee
directs AMS to seek strong enforcement of organic dairy production
standards and resolve significant variations in standard interpreta-
tion that exists among organic certifiers, as well as among organic
dairy producers. AMS shall continue to conduct critical risk-based
oversight, particularly for large, complex dairy operations, as it has
in the past four fiscal years.
Organic Data Initiative.—The Committee recognizes that accu-
rate data for the production, pricing, and marketing of organic
products is essential to maintaining stable markets, identifying
fraud, creating risk management tools, tracking production trends,
and increasing exports. Therefore, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary to require mandatory reporting on an annual basis by ac-
credited certifying agents on aggregate production areas certified
by crop and location in order to accurately calculate organic acre-
age and yield estimates on a country-by-country basis.
Pecans.—The Committee is aware that pecans are nutritious,
and value-added markets offer new potential sources of revenue for
U.S. pecan producers. The Committee encourages the USDA to
support U.S. pecan producers through the development of new do-
mestic and international markets for pecan and pecan-based prod-
ucts including but not limited to shelling and packing, pressing for
oil, bioprocessing, and usage as ingredients in other products.
Regional Food Business Centers.—The Committee recognizes the
important role the North Coasts Region plays for various seafood
products in the National and regional food systems across the coun-
try and supports efforts to strengthen supply chains and increase
and diversify market access for North Coasts Region industry part-
ners, who are responsible for seventy percent of the Nation’s sea-
food. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Secretary to explore
the establishment of a North Coasts Regional Food Business Cen-
ter and where practicable, direct the existing Regional Food Busi-
ness Centers to identify ways to strengthen seafood networks, in-
crease market access for small and mid-sized food entities, and im-
prove the viability of the industry and its products.
Soil Health.—The National Organic Standards require farmers
that voluntarily chose to certify their operation as meeting organic
practices to use farming practices that improve soil health, such as
crop rotations, cover cropping, and pasture-based livestock prac-
tices. By improving soil health, these farming practices also in-
crease the carbon sequestration potential of the soil and improve
the farm’s resilience to extreme weather events and patterns. To
maximize the climate benefits of organic agriculture, the Com-
mittee urges the National Organic Program to increase enforce-
ment efforts to ensure full compliance with the soil health and pas-
ture requirements of USDA organic standards.
Sugar Inspection.—In carrying out molasses testing required by
the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2025, the Committee is con-
cerned that progress is delayed. To ensure timely determinations of
63
whether there is circumvention of the Tariff Rate Quotas on im-
ported sugar and sugar containing products, the Committee directs
that AMS methodology and protocols specifically evaluate whether
product entering the United States under Heading 1703.20,
HTSUS, as molasses, or Heading 1702.90.40, HTSUS, as sugar
syrup blends, fails to meet any one of the following criteria: derived
from sugar cane or beet containing soluble non-sugar solids (ex-
cluding any foreign substance that may have been added or devel-
oped in the product) greater than 6 percent by weight of the total
soluble solids, derived from sugar cane or beet with a Brix value
of 78.5 degrees or greater (determined by ICUMSA Method GS4–
15 (1994), derived from sugar cane with reducing sugar of 15 per-
cent or greater (determined by ICUMSA Method GS4/3–3 (2007), or
derived from sugar beet with a total sugar value of less than 55
percent (determined by ICUMSA Method GS4/3–7 (2011). Each cri-
terion is a practical means of delineating between proper and im-
proper product entry, and the Committee directs AMS to report the
agency’s findings based on these criteria to the Committee and ap-
propriate agencies.
Wild Game Processing Technical Assistance.—The Committee
recognizes the important role of wild game processing in rural food
supply chains, especially in the business models of small and very-
small processors. The Committee encourages AMS to expand the
scope of the existing Meat and Poultry Processing Capacity-Tech-
nical Assistance Program to include assistance for processors inter-
ested in opening or expanding facilities that conduct custom-ex-
empt wild game processing.
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $62,596,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 62,596,000
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97–
35) initiated a system of user fees for the cost of grading and
classing cotton and tobacco. These activities, authorized under the
U.S. Cotton Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 51 et seq.), the Tobacco In-
spection Act (7 U.S.C. 511 et seq.), and other provisions of law are
designed to facilitate commerce and protect participants in the in-
dustry.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a limitation of $62,596,000 on ad-
ministrative expenses of the Agricultural Marketing Service.

Under section 32 of the act of August 24, 1935, (Public Law 74–
320), an amount equal to 30 percent of customs receipts collected
during each preceding calendar year and unused balances are
available for encouraging the domestic consumption and expor-
64
tation of agricultural commodities. An amount equal to 30 percent
of receipts collected on fishery products is transferred to the De-
partment of Commerce. Additional transfers to the child nutrition
programs of the Food and Nutrition Service have been provided in
recent appropriations acts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a transfer from section 32 funds of

Section 7:
Section 32 Authorities.—Under the authority described in clause
3 of 7 U.S.C. 612c, the Secretary is able to direct funds from the

Section 8:
section 32 account to increase the purchasing power of producers.
This practice has been used on various occasions to provide direct
assistance to producers when market forces or natural conditions
adversely affect the financial condition of farmers and ranchers.
The Committee notes the importance of the ability of the Secretary
to utilize this authority but believes that communication between
USDA and Congress should be improved when this practice is
used. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide no-
65
tification to the Committee in advance of any public announcement
or release of section 32 funds under the specific authorities cited
above.
PAYMENTS TO STATES AND POSSESSIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,000,000
The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program is author-
ized by section 204(b) of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7
U.S.C. 1621–1627, 1635–1638) and is also funded from appropria-
tions. Matching grants are awarded on a competitive basis to State
marketing agencies to identify and test market alternative farm
commodities, determine methods of providing more reliable market
information, and develop better commodity grading standards. This
program has made many types of projects possible, such as elec-
tronic marketing and agricultural product diversification. Current
projects are focused on the improvement of marketing efficiency
and effectiveness and seeking new outlets for existing farm pro-
duced commodities. The legislation grants USDA authority to es-
tablish cooperative agreements with State departments of agri-
culture or similar State agencies to improve the efficiency of the
agricultural marketing chain. The States perform the work or con-
tract it to others and must contribute at least one-half of the cost
of the projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,000,000 for
Payments to States and Possessions for Federal-State marketing
projects and activities.
LIMITATION ON INSPECTION AND WEIGHING SERVICES EXPENSES
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $55,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,000,000
The agency provides an official grain inspection and weighing
system under the U.S. Grain Standards Act [USGSA] (Public Law
64–190, and official inspection of rice and grain-related products
under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621–1627,
1635–1638). The USGSA was amended in 1981 to require the col-
lection of user fees to fund the costs associated with the operation,
supervision, and administration of Federal grain inspection and
weighing activities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a limitation of $55,000 on inspection
and weighing services expenses.
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOOD SAFETY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,117,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,117,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety provides direc-
tion and coordination in carrying out the laws enacted by the Con-
gress with respect to the Department’s inspection of meat, poultry,
66
and processed egg products. The Office has oversight and manage-
ment responsibilities for the Food Safety and Inspection Service
[FSIS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,117,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety.
FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,214,009,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,226,000,000
The major objectives of the FSIS are to ensure that meat and
poultry products are wholesome, unadulterated, and properly la-
beled and packaged, as required by the Federal Meat Inspection
Act (Public Law 59–242) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act
(Public Law 85–172), as amended; and to provide continuous in-
plant inspection to egg processing plants under the Egg Products
Inspection Act (Public Law 91–597).
The Food Safety and Inspection Service was established on June
17, 1981, by Secretary’s Memorandum No. 1000–1, issued pursuant
to Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953.
The inspection program of the Food Safety and Inspection Serv-
ice provides in-plant inspection of all domestic plants preparing
meat, poultry, or egg products for sale or distribution; reviews for-
eign inspection systems and establishments that prepare meat or
poultry products for export to the United States; and provides tech-
nical and financial assistance to States which maintain meat and
poultry inspection programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,226,000,000
for the Food Safety and Inspection Service.
The following table represents the Committee’s specific rec-
ommendations for the FSIS as compared to the fiscal year 2025 lev-
els:

Brazilian Beef.—The Committee urges FSIS to maintain current
rates of reinspection tasks for raw beef imports from Brazil and to
adjust rates of import inspection as necessary and consistent with
import compliance history. The Committee also requests FSIS to
continue conducting routine onsite verification audits of the Bra-
zilian inspection system.
67
Good Commercial Practices.—The Committee recognizes that the
handling of birds at slaughter according to Good Commercial Prac-
tices [GCP] reduces the occurrence of adulterated poultry products
that meet the definition of adulteration in the Poultry Products In-
spection Act [PPIA] (21 U.S.C. 453(g)(5)) from entering the market-
place. The Committee directs the USDA to track the GCP
verification activities in FSIS’ Public Health Information System,
which are intended to reduce instances of adulteration.
Humane Slaughter.—The Committee directs FSIS to continue to
provide annual reports to the Committee on the implementation of
objective scoring methods undertaken by FSIS to enforce the Hu-
mane Methods of Slaughter Act (Public Law 85–765). The report
shall also include whether funding opportunities, including grants
and cost share opportunities, exist under current USDA programs
and initiatives that can be utilized by producers for the purpose of
obtaining and maintaining third-party certification of animal-rais-
ing practices.
The Committee further directs FSIS to continue preparation and
online publication of the Humane Handling Quarterly Reports, to
include the number of humane handling verification procedures
performed, the number of administrative enforcement actions
taken, time spent on Humane Handling Activities Tracking System
activities, and comparisons of these measurements by plant size
and FSIS district.
The Committee also directs FSIS to ensure that personnel hired
with funding previously provided specifically for Humane Methods
of Slaughter Act (Public Law 85–765) enforcement focus their at-
tention on overseeing compliance with humane handling rules for
live animals as they arrive and are offloaded and handled in pens,
chutes, and stunning areas and that all inspectors receive robust
training.
Non-Ambulatory Livestock.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall
submit to Congress, 90 days after enactment of this act, a report
on the scope of non-ambulatory livestock at slaughter establish-
ments; the causes that render livestock non-ambulatory at slaugh-
ter establishments; the humane treatment of non-ambulatory live-
stock at slaughter establishments; the public health threat of non-
ambulatory pigs entering the food system, including, at minimum,
the impact on public health from pathogens associated with non-
ambulatory pigs including, but not limited to Salmonella and
Campylobacter.
State Meat and Poultry Inspection [MPI] Programs.—The Com-
mittee is supportive of MPI Programs and recognizes the key role
they play in maintaining the integrity of the Nation’s food supply,
and as such, the Committee provides an additional $15,000,000 to
ensure that the Federal reimbursement rate is 50 percent. As the
Department carries out its responsibilities in administering the
MPI programs, the Committee encourages the department to work
with participating States to ensure that funds are provided in a
timely manner.
TITLE II
FARM PRODUCTION AND CONSERVATION PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FARM PRODUCTION AND
CONSERVATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,527,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,527,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Farm Production and Con-
servation [FPAC] provides direction and coordination in carrying
out the laws enacted by the Congress with respect to the Depart-
ment’s commodity programs, farm loans, disaster assistance, crop
insurance, natural resources conservation and environment pro-
grams, and certain energy programs. The Office has oversight and
management responsibilities for the Farm Service Agency [FSA]
(including the Commodity Credit Corporation), Risk Management
Agency [RMA], and the Natural Resources Conservation Service
[NRCS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,527,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Farm Production and Con-
servation.
Communication.—The Committee is committed to supporting the
mission and values of the Natural Resources Conservation Service,
including through critical investments to protect our land, water,
and soil. The Committee directs NRCS to continue to brief the
Committee on ongoing and upcoming initiatives on a monthly
basis, as well as resources necessary for continued success of the
Service.
Emergency Conservation Program.—The Committee is encour-
aged by the Department’s work to provide advance cost-share pay-
ments under the emergency conservation loan program and emer-
gency forest restoration program. The committee encourages USDA
to further expand advance cost share payments as well as clarify
that wildfires which are not caused naturally but the spread of the
wildfire is due to natural causes or which are caused by the Fed-
eral Government are eligible for the program. Additionally, the De-
partment should explore flexibility in the timeline for utilizing
funding to implement necessary conservation work following a dis-
aster.
Internships.—The Committee understands the importance of re-
cruiting the next generation of staff for both FSA and NRCS. The
Committee directs the Department to provide a report on how in-
terns can be better utilized, including converting interns that work
for third-party partners and any statutory or regulatory changes
that may be necessary.

USDA–Customer and Producer Farm Delivery Systems Mod-
ernization.—The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a plan
within 60 days of enactment of this act that accelerates the contin-
ued implementation and expansion of the Farmers.gov application
and Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset [EDAPT]. De-
spite the continued direction and funding provided by Congress in
previous fiscal years for these modernization applications, the Com-
mittee is aware that the Farm Service Agency, the Farm Produc-
tion and Conservation Business Center, and the Office of the Chief
Information Officer continue to maintain numerous legacy mission
support systems that should be decommissioned and transitioned
to applications and mission support services systems that are inter-
operable, facts-based, data driven, and are provided efficiently, ef-
fectively, and professionally with a commitment to excellent cus-
tomer service for USDA customers, including farmers, ranchers,
and forest landowners.

The Committee recommends an appropriation of $238,500,000 for
the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center.
FARM SERVICE AGENCY
The Farm Service Agency was established October 13, 1994, pur-
suant to the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of
Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354). The
FSA administers a variety of activities, such as the commodity
price support and production adjustment programs financed by the
Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC]; the Conservation Reserve
Program [CRP]; the Emergency Conservation Program [ECP]; the
Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised
Fish Program [ELAP]; the Commodity Operation Programs, includ-
ing the warehouse examination function; farm ownership, farm op-
erating, emergency disaster, and other loan programs; and the
Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program [NAP], which pro-
vides crop loss protection for growers of many crops for which crop
insurance is not available. In addition, FSA currently provides cer-
tain administrative support services to the Foreign Agricultural
Service [FAS] and RMA.

The account Salaries and Expenses, Farm Service Agency, funds
the administrative expenses of program administration and other
functions assigned to FSA. The funds consist of appropriations and
transfers from the CCC export credit guarantees, Food for Peace
loans, and Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund program accounts,
as well as miscellaneous advances from other sources. All adminis-
trative funds used by FSA are consolidated into one account. The
consolidation provides clarity and better management and control
of funds and facilitates accounting, fiscal, and budgetary work by
eliminating the necessity for making individual allocations and al-
lotments and maintaining and recording obligations and expendi-
tures under numerous separate accounts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,515,110,000
for salaries and expenses of the Farm Service Agency, including a
direct appropriation of $1,209,307,000.
Acequia Irrigated Land.—The Committee recognizes that
acequias serve as the primary method of irrigation in many rural
and underserved communities in New Mexico and that acequias re-
main an integral aspect of New Mexican cultural identity. Recent
changes administered by FSA changed eligibility of drought on
farms and ranches irrigated by acequias for the Noninsured Crop
Disaster Assistance Program [NAP]. Given the Farm Service Agen-
cy has historically considered drought on acequia-irrigated land eli-
gible for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance and the ongoing se-
vere drought conditions in New Mexico and throughout the west,
the Committee urges the Department to maintain their position
that drought on acequia-irrigated land is an eligible cause of loss
for NAP.
Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act.—USDA is re-
sponsible for monitoring foreign purchases of agricultural land
under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act [AFIDA]
and for assessing penalties on entities that have failed to make dis-
closures as required. The Committee is concerned that USDA failed
to assess penalties for a failure to disclose foreign investments in
American agricultural land. The Committee directs the Secretary
to report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act
on USDA’s efforts to ensure that foreign investments are being ac-
curately disclosed, including an analysis of any barriers USDA
faces in conducting oversight of these purchases and planned steps
for overcoming these challenges.
Agricultural Production and Farms.—The Committee is con-
cerned about the loss of agricultural production and farms, particu-
larly in New England. Within 180 days of enactment, FSA is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committee on what factors are
leading to agricultural production and farm loss in New England,
to include historical and projected data on acreage and crops types.
Aquaculture Training.—The Committee encourages FSA to dedi-
cate resources to train all county staff on aquaculture farming
practices and aquaculture product eligibility for USDA programs,
as applicable. The Committee also encourages FSA to dedicate re-
sources to assist county staff with aquaculture data and informa-
71
tion collection necessary to inform disaster assistance determina-
tions.
Disaster Preparedness.—The Committee recognizes that millions
of farm animals die each year due to the effects of adverse weather.
The Committee is also aware that veterinary and agricultural trade
associations recognize the importance of disaster planning in pre-
venting the extent of livestock deaths. For these reasons, the
USDA has been directed by the Committee during several of the
past fiscal years to work with producers to develop disaster plans.
The Committee directs USDA to provide a report on the number
or percentage of producers receiving payments under the Livestock
Indemnity Program who have disaster plans in place at the time
of loss, and additional activities conducted by the Department to
promote disaster planning and ensure that livestock and poultry
producers have adequate disaster plans in place to reduce animal
deaths and injuries within 90 days of enactment of the act.
FSA Staffing.— The Committee commends FSA for the analyt-
ical and data-driven work that it has done to identify the appro-
priate staffing levels at county offices and how to most effectively
serve their constituents. The Committee looks forward to con-
tinuing to work with FSA on ensuring county offices are staffed ac-
cordingly. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act and quarterly
therafter, FSA is directed to brief the Committee on its workload
analysis and staffing, and to include planned versus actual hires.
Information Technology.—The Committee remains dedicated to
ensuring FSA has reliable and functioning IT systems because it
is critical that farmers and ranchers have access to the tools they
need to succeed. The Committee has invested significant taxpayer
dollars to modernize outdated systems and continues to provide re-
sources for this effort. The Committee continues statutory language
that allows funds for IT to be obligated only after the Secretary
meets certain reporting requirements. The Committee expects the
agency to follow the recommendations of the third party IT anal-
ysis where applicable. FSA is directed to provide timely updates for
future IT needs.
STATE MEDIATION GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,500,000
This program is authorized under title V of the Agricultural
Credit Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–233). Originally designed to ad-
dress agricultural credit disputes, the program was expanded by
the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture
Reorganization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354) to include other
agricultural issues such as wetland determinations, conservation
compliance, rural water loan programs, grazing on National Forest
System lands, and pesticides. Grants are made to States whose me-
diation programs have been certified by the FSA. Grants will be
solely for operation and administration of the State’s agricultural
mediation program.
72
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $6,500,000 for
State Mediation Grants.
GRASSROOTS SOURCE WATER PROTECTION PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,000,000
This program is intended to assist in the protection of ground-
water through State rural water associations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $7,000,000 for
Grassroots Source Water Protection.
DAIRY INDEMNITY PROGRAM
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 500,000
Under the program, the Department makes indemnification pay-
ments to dairy farmers and manufacturers of dairy products who,
through no fault of their own, suffer income losses because they are
directed to remove their milk from commercial markets due to con-
tamination of their products by registered pesticides. The program
also authorizes indemnity payments to dairy farmers for losses re-
sulting from the removal of cows or dairy products from the market
due to nuclear radiation or fallout.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of such sums as
may be necessary, estimated in fiscal year 2026 to be $500,000, for
indemnity payments to dairy farmers.
GEOGRAPHICALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,500,000
This program is authorized under Title I of the Food, Conserva-
tion, and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8792). Under the Reim-
bursement Transportation Cost Payment Program for Geographi-
cally Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers, the Department off-
sets a portion of the costs of transporting agricultural inputs and
products over long distances for farmers and ranchers outside the
contiguous United States that face tremendously high costs for
transporting agriculture products and inputs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,500,000 for
the Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program for
Geographically Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers.
73
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT INSURANCE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Program Account [ACIF]
is used to provide direct and guaranteed farm ownership, farm op-
erating, conservation, Indian highly fractioned land, and emergency
loans to individuals, as well as the following types of loans to asso-
ciations: irrigation and drainage, grazing, Indian Tribe land acqui-
sition, and boll weevil eradication.
FSA is also authorized to provide financial assistance to bor-
rowers by guaranteeing loans made by private lenders having a
contract of guarantee from FSA as approved by the Secretary of
Agriculture and to establish Beginning Farmer and Rancher Indi-
vidual Development grant accounts.
The following programs are financed through this fund:
Boll Weevil Eradication Loans.—Made to assist foundations in fi-
nancing the operations of the boll weevil eradication programs pro-
vided to farmers.
Emergency Loans.—Made to producers to aid recovery from pro-
duction and physical losses due to drought, flooding, other natural
disasters, or quarantine. The loans may be used to restore or re-
place essential property; pay all or part of production costs associ-
ated with the disaster year; pay essential family living expenses;
reorganize the farming operation; and refinance certain debts.
Farm Operating Loans.—Provide short-to-intermediate term pro-
duction or chattel credit to farmers who cannot obtain credit else-
where, to improve their farm and home operations, and to develop
or maintain a reasonable standard of living. The term of the loan
varies from one to 7 years.
Farm Ownership Loans.—Made to borrowers who cannot obtain
credit elsewhere to restructure their debts, improve or purchase
farms, refinance nonfarm enterprises which supplement but do not
supplant farm income, or make additions to farms. Loans are made
for 40 years or less.
Indian Tribe Land Acquisition Loans.—Made to any Indian Tribe
recognized by the Secretary of the Interior or Tribal corporation es-
tablished pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act (Public Law
93–638) which does not have adequate uncommitted funds to ac-
quire lands or interest in lands within the Tribe’s reservation or
Alaskan Indian community, as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, for use of the Tribe or the corporation or the members
thereof.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a total loan level of $10,477,388,000
for programs within the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Pro-
gram Account.
The following table reflects the program levels for farm credit
programs administered by the Farm Service Agency recommended

RISK MANAGEMENT AGENCY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $65,637,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 65,637,000
The Risk Management Agency performs administrative functions
relative to the Federal Crop Insurance program that is authorized
by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508), as amended by
the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 [ARPA] (Public Law
75
106–224), the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–79), and
the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–334).
ARPA authorized significant changes in the crop insurance pro-
gram. This act provides higher government subsidies for producer
premiums to make coverage more affordable; expands research and
development for new insurance products and under-served areas
through contracts with the private sector; and strengthens compli-
ance. Functional areas of risk management are: research and de-
velopment; insurance services; and compliance, the functions of
which include policy formulation and procedures and regulations
development.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $65,637,000 for
Risk Management Agency, Salaries and Expenses.
The Committee recognizes that there are many research prior-
ities that competitive funding may be used to address, including
the feasibility of insurance programs to cover business interruption
due to integrator bankruptcy and catastrophic loss in the poultry
industry. The Committee encourages RMA to support research into
these priorities.
Administrative and Operating Expenses.—The Committee en-
courages the RMA to provide an annual inflation adjustment to ad-
ministrative and operating [A&O] reimbursements and to provide
equitable relief for specialty crop policies in a manner similar to a
previous adjustment that was initiated without renegotiation of the
Standard Reinsurance Agreement.
Alfalfa.—The Committee recognizes alfalfa to be an important
domestic forage crop valued for nitrogen fixation, soil conservation,
crop rotation, and as a natural habitat. From 2004 through 2025,
alfalfa acreage has declined 27.8 percent. The Committee encour-
ages RMA to explore the creation of a revenue and/or quality al-
falfa crop insurance policy to ensure producers have a safety net
that they need to produce this important crop.
Biofuels.—The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture,
within 12 months after the date of the enactment of this act, and
in consultation with the Risk Management Agency, the Farm Serv-
ice Agency, and the Natural Resource Conservation Service, to sub-
mit to Congress a written report on how the Department can
streamline opportunities for farmers to insure primary and sec-
ondary crops with revenue streams resulting from biofuel use, in-
cluding but not limited to sustainable aviation fuel, with particular
reference to carinata, pennycress, camelina, and other oilseeds.
Crop Insurance in New England.—The Committee is concerned
that growers in New England are underserved by the Federal crop
insurance program. The Committee emphasizes RMA’s authority to
design actuarially sound crop insurance policies that reflect re-
gional differences in growing practices and conditions, as well as
crop diversity and marketing practices. The Committee appreciates
RMA’s decision to convene a working group of New England apple
growers to help better inform future policies and encourages RMA
to consider convening similar working groups for regional growers
of other crops. RMA is directed to report to the Committee within
76
180 days on its outreach efforts on this issue as well as its plans
for additional working groups.
NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE
The Natural Resources Conservation Service was established
pursuant to the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of
1994 (Public Law 103–354). The NRCS works with conservation
districts, watershed groups, and Federal and State agencies to
bring about physical adjustments in land use that will conserve soil
and water resources, provide for agricultural production on a sus-
tained basis, and reduce flood damage and sedimentation.
CONSERVATION OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $895,754,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 895,754,000
Conservation operations are authorized by Public Law 74–46 (16
U.S.C. 590a-590f). Activities include:
Conservation Technical Assistance provides assistance to district
cooperators and other land users in the planning and application
of conservation treatments to control erosion and improve the
quantity and quality of soil resources; improve and conserve water;
enhance fish and wildlife habitat; conserve energy; improve wood-
land, pasture, and range conditions; and reduce upstream flooding
to protect and enhance the natural resource base.
Resource appraisal and program development ensures that pro-
grams administered by the Secretary for the conservation of soil,
water, and related resources shall respond to the Nation’s long-
term needs.
Plant Materials Centers assemble, test, and encourage increased
use of plant species which show promise for use in the treatment
of conservation problem areas.
Snow Survey and Water Forecasting provides estimates of an-
nual water availability from high mountain snow packs and sum-
mer stream flow in the Western States and Alaska. Information is
used by agriculture, industry, and cities in estimating future water
supplies.
Soil Surveys inventory the Nation’s basic soil resources and de-
termine land capabilities and conservation treatment needs. Soil
survey publications include interpretations useful to cooperators,
other Federal and State agencies, and local organizations.

Acre-for-Acre Wetlands Mitigation.—The Secretary is encouraged
to use mitigation with the conversion of a natural wetland and
equivalent wetlands functions at a ratio which does not exceed 1-
to-1 acreage.
Agricultural Open Burning Alternatives.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the Environmental Quality Incentive Pro-
gram [EQIP], which provides Federal funding and technical assist-
ance to farmers throughout the Nation. The Committee urges
USDA to prioritize EQIP awards to projects that enable the pur-
chase of equipment to process agricultural woody waste generated
from orchard and vineyard removals as an alternative to open
burning.
Bio-Diverse Microbial Soil Health.—The Committee recognizes
that research and data continue to show that improved soil health
via bio-diverse microbial soil amendments has a significant positive
impact for American farm and ranch lands, supporting an essential
domestic asset in a global market. The Committee encourages
USDA to support the expanded and continued use of these multi-
kingdom biologic soil health solutions across a broad range of Nat-
ural Resources Conservation Service programs, including the Envi-
ronmental Quality Incentives Program, to address soil health bene-
fits related to yield increase, advanced root development, input effi-
ciency, improved water efficacy, catastrophic soil damage restora-
tion, and catalysts to other soil health practices such as reduced
tillage.
Code 590.—The Committee recognizes the need for NRCS to up-
date the Nutrient Management Conservation Practice Standard
(Code 590) and related practices to enhance nutrient efficiency and
reduce environmental impacts. Scenario #27 under Practice Stand-
ard 441 supports manure application via dripline systems and has
enabled ‘‘SDI, Manure’’ cost-share programs in California, Oregon,
and Washington through EQIP. However, this scenario is not
broadly applicable, and the 2-in-5-year Irrigation History Require-
ment under Standard 441 poses a barrier for non-irrigated farmers,
inadvertently encouraging inefficient irrigation solely to qualify for
funding. To address this, the Committee encourages USDA to ex-
pand eligibility for SDI (subsurface drip irrigation) systems in nu-
trient management beyond current geographic and operational lim-
its and to incorporate them under Code 590.
Critical Conservation Areas [CCA].—The Committee supports
CCAs and the collaborative regional approach to address common
natural resources goals while maintaining or improving agricul-
tural productivity. The Committee urges NRCS to provide suffi-
cient Conservation Technical Assistance funds to CCAs to address
78
conservation planning backlogs. The Committee also encourages
NRCS to leverage all possible resources to identify nutrient loss
and reduce runoff to achieve the goals of the 2015 Gulf Hypoxia Ac-
tion Plan.
Drought Resilience.—The Committee applauds the passage of the
Colorado River Basin Drought Contingency Plans, appreciates ef-
forts to increase efficiencies, and expects NRCS to utilize all avail-
able opportunities to assist producers, irrigators, and irrigation dis-
tricts in addressing drought resiliency and mitigation while main-
taining strong rural and agriculture communities and protecting
natural resources. NRCS is expected to prioritize implementation of
Drought Contingency Plans, agreements, or programs that con-
serve surface or ground water, improve drought resiliency, and ad-
dress current and anticipated conservation needs and drought-re-
lated resource concerns.
Furthermore, the Committee encourages NRCS to enter into ad-
ditional cooperative agreements with the Appropriate Technology
Transfer for Rural Areas program to develop additional state or re-
gion specific healthy soil and water management best practice
guides to support drought resilience and soil health in the western
United States.
Fencing.—The Committee directs the agency to explore ways to
maximize assistance to producers with wildlife exclusion fencing
within the authority provided by the Environmental Quality Incen-
tive Program.
Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative.—The Committee provides
$10,000,000 for the Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative (16
U.S.C. 3839bb), of which $8,000,000 shall be provided through
State allocations as competitive grants to diverse partnerships, in-
cluding socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and their or-
ganizations, to provide technical assistance to producers for grazing
planning and implementation, conferences and other education,
demonstrations, producer networks, workforce training, research,
and outreach projects to improve agricultural resilience. NRCS is
directed to provide the remaining $2,000,000 through a cooperative
agreement with a national grazing lands conservation coalition to
establish diverse State-based coalitions and to undertake grazing
education.
Interagency Coordination.—The Committee directs the Natural
Resources Conservation Service to work with the Bureau of Rec-
lamation to expand interagency coordination of Federal invest-
ments in communities that need help addressing water conserva-
tion and drought resilience issues.
Additionally, the Committee encourages NRCS to work more
closely with the Fish and Wildlife Service for all volunteer pro-
grams that promote fish and wildlife conservation efforts, through
cooperative agreements, to continue to provide free technical and fi-
nancial assistance to landowners, managers, tribes, corporations,
schools, and nonprofits interested in improving wildlife habitat on
their land. Both agencies should continue to collaborate on stream-
lining ESA listings and consultations especially for large-ranged
species and for geographies where multiple listed species overlap in
their ranges.
79
Land Grants and Acequias.—The Committee recognizes that sec-
tion 2304(e) of Public Law 115–334 allows acequias and land grant
mercedes to apply directly to the Environmental Quality Incentives
Program [EQIP], which provides Federal funding and technical as-
sistance to farmers throughout the Nation. The Committee appre-
ciates that there are hundreds of acequias and dozens of land
grants in New Mexico that can now gain direct access to this im-
portant conservation program. The Committee urges USDA to de-
velop EQIP guidance that ensures timely input from local commu-
nities, including listening sessions with land grants and acequias
and directs NRCS to update the Committee on these efforts within
90 days of enactment of this Act.
Migratory Big Game Initiative.—The Committee recognizes that
working farms and ranches can provide important migratory habi-
tat for big game and other wildlife species and commends NRCS
and FSA on their collaboration with State Governments and other
partners to conserve these important working lands. The innova-
tive application of Grassland CRP and EQIP in tandem is espe-
cially important. Leveraging the unique payments, cost-share, and
technical assistance that these programs provide against one an-
other-as is being done through the USDA Migratory Big Game Ini-
tiative in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho-provides expanded support
and management flexibility for producers stewarding wildlife habi-
tat while keeping lands in production. The NRCS and FSA are en-
couraged to cooperate in expanding this innovative model to other
States. The Committee directs NRCS to submit a report to the
Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act on the progress
made in implementing the Migratory Big Game Initiative, out-
lining plans for expanding the Migratory Big Game Initiative into
additional States, and identifying barriers to achieving the goals
outlined by the initiative.
National Resources Inventory.—In reinstating the National Re-
sources Inventory in Alaska, the Committee expects NRCS to take
into account sample design, data collection software, and data proc-
essing capability in order to collect and produce scientifically cred-
ible information on the status, condition, and trends of Alaska’s
lands, soils, waters, and related resources.
Private Land Conservation.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of providing private land owners with ready access to the
many Federal, State, and local government and private resources
available to support conservation efforts on private lands. The
Committee directs NRCS to implement a multi-year cooperative
agreement with appropriate funding support to an organization
that can make conservation solutions and best practices accessible
daily to private land owners. This organization should also support
efforts to conserve the lesser-prairie chicken and implement carbon
sequestration conservation programs nationwide.
Soil Health.—The Committee recognizes that improving soil
health on agricultural lands is key to achieving both meaningful
conservation and economic benefits for producers. The Committee
is pleased to see strong stakeholder interest in the new on-farm
conservation innovation trials to test new or innovative conserva-
tion approaches and the soil health demonstration trial, which pro-
vides incentives to producers to implement practices that improve
80
soil health and increase carbon levels in the soil. The Committee
encourages the Secretary to dedicate more technical assistance
funds to establish standard protocols for measuring and testing
carbon levels to evaluate gains in soil health that will help pro-
ducers to create positive economic, environmental, and social out-
comes through ecosystem service markets. The Committee believes
the Secretary should provide additional technical assistance related
to healthy soil planning, soil carbon sequestration, and conserva-
tion activity planning. NRCS is urged to support the expansion of
existing State soil health programs and to assist interested States
in establishing new State soil health programs.
SNOTEL.—The Committee continues to be concerned by docu-
mented changes in winter weather across the country, and the im-
pact of those changes on local ecologies and economies. The Com-
mittee continues to fund the NRCS Snow Telemetry Network and
provides an additional $2,000,000 to complete a multi-phased feasi-
bility study for SNOTEL in the Northeast that includes regional
collaboration with State agencies, land-grant universities, non-gov-
ernmental organizations, private landowners, and private indus-
tries and to begin implementation of the Snow Survey and Water
Supply Forecasting Program to serve the Northeastern United
States. The Secretary is directed to brief the Committee on next
steps once the feasibility study is completed.
Streamlined Conservation Planning.—The Committee directs
NRCS to develop a streamlined conservation planning and applica-
tion process for small acreage operations to reduce the time and ef-
fort required by both the applicant and local NRCS staff to process
conservation program applications.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee directs NRCS to maintain
a record of total technical assistance dollars for the past 3 years
and annually in the future and to provide the data to the Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Agriculture and the Committee on Agri-
culture Nutrition and Forestry. This report should differentiate be-
tween mandatory and discretionary allocations.
Technical Service Providers.—The Committee urges NRCS to re-
evaluate the current matching requirements for the Technical
Service Provider program supporting State and Tribal soil health
programs.
Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production Grants.—It is the
Committee’s understanding that grant recipients may offer sub-
awards to agricultural producers so long as they meet relevant reg-
ulatory requirements. The committee supports this usage of grant
funds and encourages the agency to inform potential applicants of
this approved use in all relevant application materials using plain
language.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee supports further
investments in research regarding the positive impacts and bene-
fits of virtual fencing compared to traditional fencing on grazing
lands. The Committee directs the Natural Resources Conservation
Service to compile all available research data and submit a report,
within 90 days of enactment of this act, on the positive impacts of
precision agriculture grazing technologies, including virtual fenc-
ing, to improve soil health, grazing outcomes, and profitability.
81
Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program.—The
Committee recognizes the important role of the Voluntary Public
Access and Habitat Incentive Program [VPA–HIP] in creating and
enhancing fish and wildlife habitat and addressing a major barrier
to hunting and fishing participation: lack of access to quality places
to hunt and fish, including lakes, streams, wetlands, grasslands,
forests, and agricultural land. VPA–HIP uses a locally led, vol-
untary framework to incentivize willing private landowners to
allow access for wildlife dependent recreation. This stimulates
rural economies by increasing hunting and fishing participation
and enhances outdoor recreational opportunities nationwide. Recog-
nizing this, the Natural Resources Conservation Service is encour-
aged to expedite the distribution of any funds allocated to this pro-
gram and to support program continuity by issuing 5-year grant
awards.
Western States Conservation Partnership Initiative.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the value of collaborative, locally-led conservation
practices and remains concerned about the ongoing extreme
drought and related water issues in the American West. NRCS is
encouraged to explore the creation of a partnership initiative, simi-
lar to the recently created Chesapeake Bay States’ Partnership Ini-
tiative, to allow Western States and partners to leverage financial
and technical assistance to address regional water issues and help
build resilience to drought. Within 90 days of enactment of this act,
NRCS is directed to brief the Committee on the feasibility of such
an initiative, as well as efforts undertaken to this end.
Western Water and Working Lands.—The Committee welcomes
additional progress in operationalizing Western Water and Work-
ing Lands Framework for Conservation Action, and encourages
NRCS to dedicate financial and technical assistance resources to
support the framework, with a priority on projects with multiple
benefits. The Secretary is directed to keep the Committee apprised
of progress toward this end, beginning with a briefing 90 days after
enactment of this act.
White Oak Initiative.—White oak forests are critical for wildlife,
biodiversity, and forest products, and without swift action by pri-
vate landowners and land management agencies, there will be a
significant decline of white oak forests in the future. The Com-
mittee commends NRCS for its work to encourage white oak con-
servation and promote white oak reforestation practices and en-
courages NRCS to expand and coordinate these efforts across its
programs with the U.S. Forest Service.
Wildlife Habitat on Private Lands.—The Committee recognizes
that conservation of wildlife habitat on private lands is essential
for the recovery of many threatened and endangered species. While
Federal programs that provide direct conservation assistance can
be important contributors to species recovery efforts, such pro-
grams might not be available to, or appropriate for, all private
landowners. Private landowners interested in habitat conservation
must be empowered with access to the full range of conservation
resources that exist across the Federal Government, State and local
governments, non-profit organizations, and private entities. The
Committee encourages NRCS to provide grants to, or enter into co-
operative agreements with, non-profit organizations with expertise
82
and experience in amalgamating and providing public access to in-
formation and resources pertaining to the conservation of wildlife
habitat on private lands.
Working Lands for Wildlife.—The Committee reminds NRCS
that supporting wildlife habitat is an important part of its mission,
and encourages NRCS to continue expanding the Working Lands
for Wildlife [WLFW] Initiative. The Committee directs NRCS to
dedicate sufficient staff positions to WLFW, and to coordinate with
the Farm Service Agency on WLFW. The Committee further directs
the Under Secretary of Farm Production and Conservation to pro-
vide a report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment of
this act on the current activities and expansion of WLFW, includ-
ing identification of barriers or challenges to further expansion in
areas such as western migratory big game, northeastern deciduous
forests, Southern pines, SE aquatics, and overall habitat
connectivity across framework geographies. The report should cover
work within existing biome frameworks and identify a path to-
wards expanding to new biomes in the United States where pri-
ority resource concerns are identified.
WATERSHED AND FLOOD PREVENTION OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,650,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 52,360,000
The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Public Law
83–566) (16 U.S.C. 1000–1005, 1007–1009) provides for cooperation
between the Federal Government and the States and their political
subdivisions in a program to prevent erosion, floodwater, and sedi-
ment damages in the watersheds or rivers and streams and to fur-
ther the conservation, development, utilization, and disposal of
water and the conservation and proper utilization of land in au-
thorized watersheds.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $52,360,000 for
the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program [WFPO],
of which the Committee provides $32,360,000 for congressionally
directed projects, as specified in the table at the end of the report,
for new and ongoing watershed and flood prevention activities.
The Committee recognizes the critical challenges facing rural
water resource management and protection and supports needed
investments in watershed operations. These Federal-State-local
partnerships are uniquely positioned to identify critical watershed
protection and flood prevention needs in rural communities and im-
plement projects that deliver multiple streams of benefits for
homes, businesses, transportation infrastructure, and natural re-
sources. In selecting projects for funding, the Committee expects
the agency to balance the needs of addressing the project backlog,
remediation of existing structures, and new projects.
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under Watershed
and Flood Prevention Operations. While the Committee has pro-
vided the funding, recipients of CDS are still required to apply for
the funding and must meet all statutory and regulatory require-
83
ments. The Committee expects the agency to review the applica-
tions and fund projects in the same manner as in previous years.
Multiple Benefit Projects.—The Committee is concerned with the
funding distribution of Watershed and Flood Prevention Oper-
ations, in particular NRCS’ resistance to supporting drought resil-
iency and mitigation in the western United States. Therefore, the
Committee continues to support funding for irrigation moderniza-
tion projects that provide multiple benefits which are primarily
found in the West, including but not limited to reduction of drought
impact, improvement of water quality or in-stream flow, off-channel
renewable energy production, and increased fish or wildlife habitat.
NRCS is directed to keep the Committee apprised of streamlining
and modernization efforts for the watershed planning process, and
of efforts to coordinate with stakeholders and other agencies to en-
sure that this program is utilized in an efficient and equitable
manner to maximize its effect.
Technical Assistance Flexibility.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to provide greater flexibility to State Conservationists to be
able to utilize technical assistance dedicated for certain WFPO
funds for administration and planning Statewide for all WFPO
projects.
WATERSHED REHABILITATION PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,000,000
The Watershed Rehabilitation Program account provides for
technical and financial assistance to carry out rehabilitation of
structural measures, in accordance with section 14 of the Water-
shed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, approved August 4, 1954
(16 U.S.C. 1012, U.S.C. 1001, et seq.), as amended by section 313
of Public Law 106–472, November 9, 2000, and by section 2803 of
Public Law 110–246.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,000,000 for
the Watershed Rehabilitation Program.
The Committee recognizes the large backlog of community infra-
structure projects eligible for financial and technical assistance
from the Watershed Rehabilitation Program to address safety con-
cerns, public health, and environmental impacts of aging dams.
NRCS is urged to prioritize the rehabilitation of dams that pose the
greatest risk to public safety.
CORPORATIONS
FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE CORPORATION FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,581,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,264,000,000
The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended by the Federal
Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354), author-
izes the payment of expenses, which may include indemnity pay-
ments; loss adjustment; delivery expenses; program-related re-
search and development; startup costs for implementing this legis-
84
lation, such as studies, pilot projects, data processing improve-
ments, and public outreach; and related tasks and functions.
All program costs, except for Federal salaries and expenses, are
mandatory expenditures subject to appropriation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of such sums as
may be necessary, estimated to be $14,264,000,000 in fiscal year
2026, for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Fund.
COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION FUND
The Commodity Credit Corporation is a wholly owned Govern-
ment corporation created in 1933 to stabilize, support, and protect
farm income and prices; to help maintain balanced and adequate
supplies of agricultural commodities, including products, foods,
feeds, and fibers; and to help in the orderly distribution of these
commodities. CCC was originally incorporated under a Delaware
charter and was reincorporated June 30, 1948, as a Federal cor-
poration within USDA by the Commodity Credit Corporation Char-
ter Act (Public Law 80–806), approved June 29, 1948.
The Commodity Credit Corporation engages in buying, selling,
lending, and other activities with respect to agricultural commod-
ities, their products, food, feed, and fibers. Its purposes include sta-
bilizing, supporting, and protecting farm income and prices; main-
taining the balance and adequate supplies of selected commodities;
and facilitating the orderly distribution of such commodities. In ad-
dition, the Corporation makes available materials and facilities re-
quired in connection with the storage and distribution of such com-
modities. The Corporation also disburses funds for sharing of costs
with producers for the establishment of approved conservation
practices on environmentally sensitive land and subsequent rental
payments for such land for the duration of CRP contracts.
Corporation activities are primarily governed by the following
statutes: the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (Public
Law 80–806), as amended; the Agricultural Act of 1949 (Public Law
81–439), as amended (1949 Act); the Agricultural Adjustment Act
of 1938 (Public Law 75–430), as amended (the 1938 Act); the Food
Security Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–198), as amended (1985 Act);
the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–
246); the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–79); and the Ag-
riculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–334).
Management of the Corporation is vested in a board of directors,
subject to the general supervision and direction of the Secretary of
Agriculture, who is an ex officio director and chairman of the
board. The board consists of seven members, in addition to the Sec-
retary, who are appointed by the President of the United States
with the advice and consent of the Senate. Officers of the Corpora-
tion are designated according to their positions in USDA.
The activities of the Corporation are carried out mainly by the
personnel and through FSA facilities and FSA State and county
committees. The Foreign Agricultural Service, the General Sales
Manager, other agencies and offices of the Department, and com-
85
mercial agents are also used to carry out certain aspects of the Cor-
poration’s activities.
Under Public Law 87–155 (15 U.S.C. 713a-11, 713a-12), annual
appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year, commencing
with fiscal year 1961. These appropriations are to reimburse the
Corporation for net realized losses.
REIMBURSEMENT FOR NET REALIZED LOSSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $13,863,086,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,491,380,000
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of such sums as
may be necessary, estimated in fiscal year 2026 to be
$13,491,380,000, for the payment to reimburse the Commodity
Credit Corporation for reimbursement for net realized losses.
CRP Wetland Restoration and Wildlife Enhancement.—The Com-
mittee notes that agricultural commodity crops, if left unharvested,
may help reduce degradation of wetlands and improve sediment
trapping, surface and ground water supply, erosion control, and
wildlife habitat while providing winter food for waterfowl and other
wildlife. The Committee directs CCC, within 60 days of enactment
of this act, to amend its program policies and guidelines for CRP
conservation practices CP23 and CP23A, to provide that current
and future participants are permitted to plant, but not harvest, ag-
ricultural commodity crops as wildlife food plots on up to 10 per-
cent of the enrolled land to enhance waterfowl and upland bird
food and habitat.
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
(LIMITATION ON EXPENSES)
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $15,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,000,000
The CCC’s hazardous waste management program is intended to
ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (Public Law 96–510) and
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (Public Law 94–580).
The CCC funds operations and maintenance costs as well as site
investigation and cleanup expenses. Investigative and cleanup costs
associated with the management of CCC hazardous waste are also
paid from USDA’s hazardous waste management appropriation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a limitation of $15,000,000 for the
Commodity Credit Corporation’s hazardous waste management
program.
TITLE III
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agri-
culture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354) abolished
the Farmers Home Administration, Rural Development Adminis-
tration, and Rural Electrification Administration and replaced
those agencies with the Rural Housing and Community Develop-
ment Service, (currently, the Rural Housing Service), Rural Busi-
ness and Cooperative Development Service (currently, the Rural
Business-Cooperative Service), and Rural Utilities Service and
placed them under the oversight of the Under Secretary for Rural
Economic and Community Development, (currently, Rural Develop-
ment [RD]). These agencies deliver a variety of programs through
a network of State and field offices.
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,620,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,620,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Rural Development pro-
vides direction and coordination in carrying out laws with respect
to the Department’s rural economic and community development
activities. The Office has oversight and management responsibil-
ities for the Rural Housing Service [RHS], Rural Business-Coopera-
tive Service [RBS], and the Rural Utilities Service [RUS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,620,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Rural Development.
PAWS Act.—The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture
to continue coordinating with the Departments of Justice, Housing
and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services to effi-
ciently implement the grant program for providing emergency and
transitional shelter options for domestic violence survivors with
companion animals.
Persistent Poverty Areas.—The Committee supports targeted in-
vestments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty
counties, and directs the Department to complete the report re-
quested on this matter, which is now several years overdue. The
report shall include both the historic data requested in the original
directive as well as data for fiscal years 2025 and 2026.
Substantially Underserved Trust Area [SUTA].—The Committee
directs Rural Development to define the term ‘substantially under-
served trust area’ in the State of Hawaii to include land located
within the same county as a community located on trust lands as
defined in section 3765 of title 38, United States Code. The term
(86)
87
‘substantially underserved trust area’ means a community in trust
land (as defined in section 3765 of title 38, United States Code)
with respect to which the Secretary determines has a high need for
the benefits of an eligible program. SUTA related investments
within the same county as a community located on trust lands
must primarily benefit Native Hawaiians.

people in rural areas.
Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–
508), administrative costs associated with loan programs are appro-
priated to the program accounts. Appropriations to the salaries and
expenses account will be for costs associated with grant programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends $801,079,000 for salaries and ex-
penses of Rural Development, including a direct appropriation of
$351,087,000.
Field Office Analysis.—The Committee directs Rural Develop-
ment to complete a comprehensive analysis of their field offices.
This analysis shall include an initial data pull of all field offices by
county and the number of employees working in each office, as well
as which offices are co-located with FSA and NRCS. Rural Develop-
ment shall brief the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this
act on this initial analysis. Following this initial analysis, Rural
Development shall conduct an analysis in the same manner as FSA
has done.
Quarterly Reviews.—The Committee directs the Department to
continue to provide quarterly briefings to the Committees and to
send reports ahead of the briefings covering the following topics: in-
formation technology report with updates on retiring legacy sys-
tems, making improvements to existing systems, and moving pro-
grams away from paper-based applications; staffing report that
breaks out staffing by program, including planned versus actual
hiring by pay period; a commitment and obligation report; and
Congressionally Directed Spending obligation report. The quarterly
88
reports should also include key operational metrics to ensure the
Committee receives a complete picture of how RD is implementing
its programs and using its funding to do so.
RURAL HOUSING SERVICE
The Rural Housing Service was established under the Federal
Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganiza-
tion Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354).
RURAL HOUSING INSURANCE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 (budget authority) ............................................. $565,858,000
Committee recommendation (budget authority) ................................. 612,206,000
This fund was established in 1965 (Public Law 89–117) pursuant
to section 517 of title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 87–
171). This fund may be used to insure or guarantee rural housing
loans for single-family homes, rental and cooperative housing, farm
labor housing, and rural housing sites. Rural housing loans are
made to construct, improve, alter, repair, or replace dwellings and
essential farm service buildings that are modest in size, design,
and cost. Rental housing insured loans are made to individuals,
corporations, associations, trusts, or partnerships to provide low-
cost rental housing and related facilities in rural areas. These loans
are repayable in terms up to 30 years. The Multi-family Housing
Preservation and Revitalization Program [MPR] includes revitaliza-
tion tools for maintenance of existing units. The Federal Credit Re-
form Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508) established the Rural Hous-
ing Insurance Fund [RHIF] program account. Appropriations to
this account will be used to cover the lifetime subsidy costs associ-
ated with the direct loans obligated and loan guarantees committed
in fiscal year 2026, as well as for administrative expenses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $199,952,000,
excluding the transfer of funds, for the Rural Housing Insurance
Fund Program Account.
The following table presents the loan subsidy levels as compared

Fair Housing Protections.—The Committee supports efforts to
strengthen the protections of the Fair Housing Act, but under-
stands that more action is needed to ensure these protections reach
every community. The Committee is still awaiting information on
what resources are needed to ensure Rural Development has the
resources to collaborate with the Department of Housing and
Urban Development in order to conduct outreach and raise aware-
ness of the rights and protections under the Fair Housing Act for
all protected classes.
Farm Labor Housing.—The Committee urges the Rural Housing
Service [RHS] to release farm labor housing funding announce-
ments on an annual basis and expects RHS to increase consultation
with stakeholders.
Multifamily Housing Technical Assistance.—The Committee pro-
vides $2,000,000 for the multifamily housing technical assistance
pilot and directs the Department to prioritize maturing mortgages.
The Committee intends for this technical assistance to assist in
preservation beyond just non-profit transfer deals, including for
maturing properties looking to decouple their mortgage and rental
assistance.
Relending Program.—The Committee provides $5,000,000 in loan
level for the Section 502 Direct Tribal Relending Pilot, and to the
extent practicable, encourages the Rural Housing Service to expand
the current pilot to the Southwest and to Native CDFIs that are
partnered with Regional Housing Authorities which receive block
grant funds under Public Law 104–330. The Committee recognizes
that there is a tremendous need for safe and affordable housing in
American Indian and Alaska Native communities, and Native
American CDFIs have deep ties to the local communities they
serve, and are better equipped to more effectively reach potential
homebuyers.
The Committee directs the Secretary to allow Tribally Des-
ignated Housing Entities [TDHEs] and other entities, such as Na-
90
tive Community Development Financial Institutions [NCDFIs], to
act as intermediary lenders for the purposes of the demonstration
program.

Section 9:
Section 502 Manufactured Home Loans.—The Committee directs
USDA to continue to update Section 502 procedures and regula-
tions to clearly allow for Section 502 home loans to be made to fi-
nance manufactured homes sited in resident-owned communities,
and to brief the Committee on its work to do so within 90 days of
enactment of this act.

Section 10:
Section 523 and 524 Site Development Loans.—The Committee
recognizes the extreme need for more housing in many rural areas
across the country and believes the changes made to extend the
term of Section 523 and 524 site development loans in the Fiscal
Year 2024 Appropriations bill could help meet that demand. The
Committee directs the Department to work to support rural hous-
ing stakeholders in understanding and utilizing the revised loans
and to brief the Committee on any changes to demand for Section
523 and 524 loans within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Single Family Housing Program Access.—The Committee is con-
cerned that there are unnecessary impediments facing individuals
who utilize Single Family Housing Direct Loans and the Single
Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program to purchase homes or
property in rural areas. The Committee reminds the Department
that efficient review and approval of these applications is essential
to the success of these programs, especially in the current housing
market. Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to
submit a report, within 60 days of enactment, on the current ap-
praisal requirements for these homes and how they compare to re-
quirements used by the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment or the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Tribal Property Valuation Project.—The Committee directs the
Secretary to increase outreach to Tribal, Alaska Native, and Native
Hawaiian communities to increase awareness and utilization of the
502 Guaranteed Loans Tribal Property Valuation Project. The
Committee directs the Secretary to report to Congress before the
pilot program is terminated, including on the pilot program’s im-
pacts on breaking down barriers in lending on Tribal lands and in
assisting more eligible very low to moderate income applicants
seeking to purchase or rehabilitate affordable housing on Tribal
lands.
RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,642,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,715,000,000
Rental assistance is authorized under section 521(a)(2) of the
Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 87–171). The objective of the pro-
gram is to reduce rents paid by low-income families living in RHS-
financed rental projects and farm labor housing projects. Under
this program, low-income tenants will contribute the higher of: (1)
30 percent of monthly adjusted income; (2) 10 percent of monthly
income; or (3) designated housing payments from a welfare agency.
Payments from the fund are made to the project owner for the
difference between the tenant’s payment and the approved rental
rate established for the unit.
91
The program is administered in tandem with RHS section 515
rural rental housing program and the farm labor loan and grant
programs. Priority is given to existing projects for rental units oc-
cupied by over-burdened low-income families and projects experi-
encing financial difficulties beyond the control of the owner.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,715,000,000
for the Rental Assistance Program. Housing vouchers continue to
be addressed in the Rural Housing Voucher Account.
Decoupling of Rental Assistance.—The Committee continues to
provide authority for the Department to decouple the rental assist-
ance program from Section 515 direct loans. The Committee re-
minds the Department that this strategy should only be used when
all other methods of preservation are exhausted and directs the De-
partment to provide the Committee with quarterly updates on the
implementation of this policy. Additionally, the Committee provides
$1,000,000 for the Department to make the necessary information
technology upgrades to facilitate its decoupling efforts.
The Committee also supports uniform standards for any sale or
transfer of a property financed with a loan under section 515 to
any entity, including a non-profit organization, that is seeking to
acquire such property through section 515 financing or any low-in-
come housing tax credit under section 42 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.
Multifamily Housing Preservation Strategy.—The Committee di-
rects the Department to consider all preservation tools at its dis-
posal and to develop a report within 6 months of enactment of this
act with its multifamily housing preservation strategy including
goals, objectives, timeline, resources required, and tools to be uti-
lized.
Rental Assistance Priority.—The Secretary is encouraged to
prioritize multi-family housing properties acquired by means of a

Section 11:
section 515 loan within the current fiscal year when determining
current rental assistance needs.
RURAL HOUSING VOUCHER ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $48,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 48,000,000
The Rural Housing Voucher Program was authorized under the
Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171) to assist very low-income
families and individuals who reside in rental housing in rural
areas. Housing vouchers may be provided to residents of rental
housing projects financed by section 515 loans that have been pre-
paid or paid off after September 30, 2005. Voucher amounts reflect
the difference between comparable market rents and tenant-paid
rent prior to loan pre-payment. Vouchers allow tenants to remain
in existing projects or move to other rental housing.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $48,000,000 for
the Rural Housing Voucher Program. The Committee requests his-
toric data and projections of dollars and units served for rural
92
housing vouchers and rental assistance with the assumption that
the decoupling authority will continue to stay in place.
MUTUAL AND SELF-HELP HOUSING GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $25,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 25,000,000
The Mutual and Self-Help Housing Grants Program is author-
ized by title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171).
Grants are made to local organizations to promote the development
of mutual or self-help programs under which groups of usually 6
to 10 families build their own homes by mutually exchanging labor.
Funds may be used to pay the cost of construction supervisors who
work with families in the construction of their homes and for ad-
ministrative expenses of the organizations providing the self-help
assistance.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $25,000,000 for
Mutual and Self-Help Housing Grants.
RURAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $35,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 35,000,000
The Rural Housing Assistance Grants Program consolidates
funding for rural housing grant programs. This consolidation of
housing grant funding provides greater flexibility to tailor financial
assistance to applicant needs.
Very Low-Income Housing Repair Grants.—The Very Low-Income
Housing Repair Grants Program is authorized under section 504 of
title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171). The rural
housing repair grant program is carried out by making grants to
very low-income families to conduct necessary repairs to their
homes in order to make such dwellings safe and sanitary and to
remove hazards to the health of the occupants, their families, or
the community.
These grants may be made to cover the cost of improvements or
additions, such as repairing roofs, providing toilet facilities, pro-
viding a convenient and sanitary water supply, supplying screens,
repairing or providing structural supports, or making similar re-
pairs, additions, or improvements, including all preliminary and in-
stallation costs in obtaining central water and sewer service. A
grant can be made in combination with a section 504 very low-in-
come housing repair loan.
No assistance can be extended to any one individual in the form
of a loan, grant, or combined loans and grants in excess of
$7,500,000, and grant assistance is limited to persons or families
headed by persons who are 62 years of age or older.
Supervisory and Technical Assistance Grants.—Supervisory and
technical assistance grants are made to public and private non-
profit organizations for packaging loan applications for housing as-
sistance under sections 502, 504, 514/516, 515, and 533 of the
Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171). The assistance is di-
rected to very low-income families in underserved areas where at
93
least 20 percent of the population is below the poverty level and
at least 10 percent or more of the population resides in sub-
standard housing. In fiscal year 1994, a Homebuyer Education Pro-
gram was implemented under this authority. This program pro-
vides low-income individuals and families with education and coun-
seling on obtaining and/or maintaining occupancy of adequate
housing and supervised credit assistance to become successful
homeowners.
Compensation for Construction Defects.—Compensation for con-
struction defects provides funds for grants to eligible section 502
borrowers to correct structural defects or to pay claims of owners
arising from such defects on a newly constructed dwelling pur-
chased with RHS financial assistance. Claims are not paid until
provisions under the builder’s warranty have been fully pursued.
Requests for compensation for construction defects must be made
by the owner of the property within 18 months after the date finan-
cial assistance was granted.
Rural Housing Preservation Grants.—Rural housing preservation
grants (section 533) of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act
of 1983 (Public Law 98–181) authorizes the Rural Housing Service
to administer a program of home repair directed at low- and very
low-income people.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $35,000,000 for
the Rural Housing Assistance Grants Program.
The following table compares the grant program levels rec-
ommended by the Committee to the fiscal year 2025 levels:

RURAL COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $29,080,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 217,436,000
Community facility loans were created by the Rural Development
Act of 1972 (Public Law 92–419) to finance a variety of rural com-
munity facilities. Loans are made to organizations, including cer-
tain Indian Tribes and corporations not operated for profit and
public and quasi-public agencies, to construct, enlarge, extend, or
otherwise improve community facilities providing essential services
to rural residents. Such facilities include those providing or sup-
porting overall community development, such as fire and rescue
services, healthcare, transportation, traffic control, and community,
social, cultural, and recreational benefits. Loans are made for facili-
ties which primarily serve rural residents of open country and
rural towns and villages of not more than 20,000 people.
94
Healthcare, fire and rescue facilities, and educational facilities are
the priorities of the program and receive the majority of available
funds.
The Community Facility Grant Program authorized in the Fed-
eral Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law
104–127) is used in conjunction with the existing direct and guar-
anteed loan programs for the development of community facilities
such as hospitals, fire stations, and community centers. Grants are
targeted to the lowest income communities. Communities that have
lower population and income levels receive a higher cost-share con-
tribution through these grants with a maximum contribution of 75
percent of the cost of developing the facility.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $217,436,000 for
the Rural Community Facilities Program Account, of which
$199,436,000 is for Congressionally Direct Spending.
The following table provides the Committee’s recommendations,
as compared to the fiscal year 2025 levels:

Tribal college grants.................................................................................................. 8,000 8,000
Total, budget authority.......................................................................................... 29,080 217,436
Community Facility Guaranteed Loan Program.—The committee
encourages USDA to reduce Federal exposure to risk and expedite
the delivery of capital through the inclusion of guaranteed loans
when direct loans are offered as part of facility projects. USDA
should additionally assume that the test for credit elsewhere is sat-
isfied when the partnering guarantor sees a need for direct Federal
lending assistance consistent with existing regulatory framework, 7
CFR 1942.2(a)(1).
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under Rural Com-
munity Facilities Program. While the Committee has provided the
funding, recipients of CDS are still required to apply for the fund-
ing. The Committee expects the agency to review the applications
and fund projects in the same manner as in previous years.
Income-based Matches.—The Committee awaits the Department’s
analysis of its methodology to calculate income-based matches for
the Community Facilities Grant program and its development of
three alternative methodologies. The Department is directed to
95
brief the Committees upon completion of this analysis. If war-
ranted, the Department is directed to make changes to its method-
ology based on this analysis.
Loan Program Appraisals.—The committee directs USDA to con-
sistently apply collateral requirements between direct and guaran-
teed loan products within rural development. This may include
business and/or going concern value to be discounted from the loan-
to-value calculations. Additionally, the USDA must consistently
apply appraisal timing requirements with an aim of reducing the
need for new appraisals during later stages of a construction
project.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee encourages RHS to allow
national organizations to participate in the Community Facilities
Technical Assistance program and to increase the grant cap to en-
sure that the technical assistance need in rural areas is met.
RURAL BUSINESS-COOPERATIVE SERVICE
The Rural Business-Cooperative Service was established by the
Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Re-
organization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354), dated October 13,

Section 12:
1994. Its programs were previously administered by the Rural De-
velopment Administration, the Rural Electrification Administra-
tion, and the Agricultural Cooperative Service.
RURAL BUSINESS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $31,861,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,575,000
The Rural Business and Industry Loan Program was created by
the Rural Development Act of 1972 (Public Law 92–419), and fi-
nances a variety of rural industrial development loans. Loans are
made for rural industrialization and rural community facilities
under Rural Development Act amendments to the Consolidated
Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1932 et seq.) authori-
ties. Business and industrial loans are made to public, private, or
cooperative organizations organized for profit; to certain Indian
tribes; or to individuals for the purpose of improving, developing,
or financing business, industry, and employment or improving the
economic and environmental climate in rural areas. Such purposes
include financing business and industrial acquisition, construction,
enlargement, repair or modernization; financing the purchase and
development of land, easements, rights-of-way, buildings, and pay-
ment of startup costs; and supplying working capital.
Rural business development grants were authorized by the Agri-
cultural Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–79) and can be made to gov-
ernmental and nonprofit entities and Indian Tribes. Up to 10 per-
cent of appropriated funds may be used to identify and analyze
business opportunities; identify, train, and provide technical assist-
ance to existing or prospective rural entrepreneurs and managers;
assist in the establishment of new rural businesses and the mainte-
nance of existing businesses; conduct economic development plan-
ning, coordination, and leadership development; and establish cen-
ters for training, technology, and trade. The balance of appro-
priated funding may be used for projects that support the develop-
96
ment of business enterprises that finance or facilitate the develop-
ment of small and emerging private business enterprise; the estab-
lishment, expansion, and operation of rural distance learning net-
works; the development of rural learning programs; and the provi-
sion of technical assistance and training to rural communities for
the purpose of improving passenger transportation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $55,575,000 for
the Rural Business Program Account.
The following table provides the Committee’s recommendations,
as compared to the fiscal year 2025 levels:

Total, budget authority.......................................................................................... 31,861 55,575
Federal Regional Commissions and Authorities.—The Committee
recognizes that strong partnerships exist between RD and Federal
Regional Commissions and Authorities. The Committee encourages
RD to coordinate with the Regional Commissions to promote effi-
ciency during the grant planning and review process. Additionally,
the Committee encourages RD to ensure flexible processes are
available for each Regional Commission as appropriate.
High Energy Cost Grants.—The Committee directs the Rural
Utilities Service to permit the repair or replacement of bulk fuel
storage tanks under the High Energy Cost Grants program. The
Committee notes that such fuels are the only source of electricity
generation in certain rural and Native communities where energy
costs are excessively high and there is a significant deferred main-
tenance cost for Bulk Fuel in Tribal communities. The longstanding
purpose of the program is to assist families and individuals in com-
munities with extremely high per-household energy costs that are
275 percent of the National average or higher. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary to make $2,000,000 available for Indian Tribes
for the repair or replacement of bulk fuel storage tanks under the
Grants program, in addition to providing no less than fiscal year
2025 levels for the Denali Commission.
Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program.—The Com-
mittee encourages Rural Development to prioritize proposals for
the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program that support
the processing of invasive wild-caught catfish.
Rural Business Program Account.—The Committee recommends
$500,000 for transportation technical assistance.
97
The Committee directs that of the $4,000,000 recommended for
grants to benefit federally Recognized Native American Tribes,
$250,000 shall be used to implement an American Indian and Alas-
ka Native passenger transportation development and assistance
initiative. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Department
to improve information sharing about Rural Development’s busi-
ness support programs with local small business advisory organiza-
tions.
Rural Business Program Delivery.—The Rural Business Coopera-
tive Programs increase economic opportunity in rural America
through the delivery of necessary programs including the Business
and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, the Rural Business In-
vestment Program, and the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance
Program, among others. The Committee recognizes that the needs
of businesses and communities in rural America are unique and
commends Rural Development on its continued commitment to
meet the specific challenges. It is the sense of the Committee that
Rural Development remains the most well-positioned agency to ad-
minister such programs, and that RD should continue to seek
means of improving program access and effectiveness.
The Committee encourages the Department to continue collabo-
rating with the Small Business Administration as outlined in the
memorandum of understanding signed on November 20, 2023. The
Committee directs the Department, in collaboration with the SBA,
to report on the activities undertaken as a result of the memo-
randum, including opportunities to collaborate on technical assist-
ance, especially with respect to exportation and procurement.
Sustainable Aviation Fuels.—The Committee notes that sustain-
able aviation fuel [SAF] has the potential to decarbonize the avia-
tion industry by utilizing several feedstocks, such as ethanol, soy,
tallow, wood biomass, agricultural residue, and cover crops. The
cultivation of these feedstocks could provide a significant economic
opportunity in rural communities across the Nation. The Bio-
refinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufac-
turing Assistance Program, also known as the 9003 Program, has
the potential to scale up the volume of SAF by providing loans and
financial support to burgeoning enterprises in rural America.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture to
provide a report to Congress that includes 9003 program loan
metrics and if converting current loan authority into grants could
be used to accelerate and scale SAF research and development and
biorefinery construction.
Tribal Buffalo Restoration.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to set aside a portion of the rural business development
grants to benefit federally-chartered Tribal organizations with de-
monstrable expertise in Tribal buffalo restoration efforts, for the
purchase and operation of mobile buffalo meat processing units to
support federally recognized Native American Tribes’ activities re-
lated to buffalo meat production.

Estimated loan level ....................................................................................................... 10,000 13,000
Direct loan subsidy ......................................................................................................... 3,406 2,954
Administrative expenses ................................................................................................. 4,468 4,468
Total, loan subsidies and administrative expenses ......................................... 7,874 7,422
The Rural Development Intermediary Relending Loan program
was originally authorized by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964
(Public Law 88–452). The making of rural development loans by
USDA was reauthorized by the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public
Law 113–79).
Loans are made to intermediary borrowers (small investment
groups) who in turn will reloan the funds to rural businesses, com-
munity development corporations, private nonprofit organizations,
public agencies, et cetera, for the purpose of improving business,
industry, community facilities, employment opportunities, and di-
versification of the economy in rural areas.
The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 74–605) es-
tablished the program account. Appropriations to this account will
be used to cover the lifetime subsidy costs associated with the di-
rect loans obligated in 2026, as well as administrative expenses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $7,422,000 for
the Intermediary Relending Program Fund, including $4,468,000 to
be merged with salaries and expenses.
RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The Rural Economic Development Loans program was estab-
lished by the Reconciliation Act of December 1987 (Public Law
100–203), which amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7
U.S.C. 901), by establishing a new section 313. This section of the
Rural Electrification Act (7 U.S.C. 901) established a cushion of
credit payment program and created the rural economic develop-
ment subaccount. The Administrator of RUS is authorized under
the act to utilize funds in this program to provide zero interest
loans to electric and telecommunications borrowers for the purpose
of promoting rural economic development and job creation projects,
including funding for feasibility studies, startup costs, and other
reasonable expenses for the purpose of fostering rural economic de-
velopment.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends a loan program level of $50,000,000
and $10,000,000 in grants to be funded from earnings on the Cush-
ion of Credit and fees on guaranteed underwriting loans made pur-
suant to section 313A of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7
U.S.C. 901).

RURAL COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $24,600,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 24,800,000
Rural cooperative development grants are authorized under sec-
tion 310B(e) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act
(Public Law 113–79), as amended. Grants are made to fund the es-
tablishment and operation of centers for rural cooperative develop-
ment with the primary purpose of improving economic conditions
in rural areas. Grants may be made to nonprofit institutions or in-
stitutions of higher education. Grants may be used to pay up to 75
percent of the cost of the project and associated administrative
costs. The applicant must contribute at least 25 percent from non-
Federal sources, except 1994 institutions, which only need to pro-
vide 5 percent. Grants are competitive and are awarded based on
specific selection criteria.
Cooperative research agreements are authorized by 7 U.S.C.
2204b. The funds are used for cooperative research agreements,
primarily with colleges and universities, on critical operational, or-
ganizational, and structural issues facing cooperatives.
Cooperative agreements are authorized under 7 U.S.C. 2201 to
any qualified State departments of agriculture, universities, and
other State entities to conduct research that will strengthen and
enhance the operations of agricultural marketing cooperatives in
rural areas.
The Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas [ATTRA]
program was first authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985
(Public Law 99–198). The program provides information and tech-
nical assistance to agricultural producers to adopt sustainable agri-
cultural practices that are environmentally friendly and lower pro-
duction costs.

The Committee recommends an appropriation of $5,800,000 for
Rural Cooperative Development Grants.
Of the funds recommended, $3,500,000 is for the Appropriate
Technology Transfer for Rural Areas program.
The Committee includes bill language directing that not more
than $3,000,000 be made available to cooperatives or associations
of cooperatives whose primary focus is to provide assistance to
small, minority producers.
Agriculture Innovation Centers.—The Committee recommends
$1,000,000 for Agriculture Innovation Center funding, as author-
ized in section 6402 of Public Law 107–171. Prior year or current
grant awardees shall be eligible for these funds.
Value-Added Producer Grants [VAPG].—The Committee directs
that Value-Added Producer Grants be prioritized to support the
production of value-added agricultural products, including dairy
and small farms, with significant potential to expand production
and processing in the United States.
The Committee encourages USDA to promote awareness among
potential applicants of the availability of VAPG funds for eligible
projects that modify animal housing systems to comply with state
requirements, such as States that require animal products to come
from cage-free and crate-free housing systems, or facilitate the sale
of compliant products to new markets.
RURAL MICROENTREPRENEUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $4,629,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,000,000
The Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program is authorized
under section 379E(d) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Devel-
opment Act (7 U.S.C. 2008s). This program provides direct loans
and grants to microentreprenuer development organizations with
the skills necessary to establish new rural microenterprises and
provide technical assistance to maintain the successful operation of
rural microenterprises.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $5,000,000 for

RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. ...........................
Committee recommendation ................................................................. ...........................
The Rural Energy for America Program is authorized under sec-
tion 9007 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002
(Public Law 107–171). This program may fund energy audits, di-
101
rect loans, loan guarantees, and grants to farmers, ranchers, and
small rural businesses for the purchase of renewable energy sys-
tems and for energy efficiency improvements.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee does not recommend a discretionary appropria-
tion for the Rural Energy for America Program, as the program has
a negative subsidy rate. The Committee recommends a loan level
of $100,000,000.
HEALTHY FOOD FINANCING INITIATIVE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 500,000
The Healthy Food Financing Initiative is authorized under sec-
tion 4206 of the Agricultural Act of 2014. This program provides
financial and technical assistance to regional, State and local part-
nerships, and helps fund projects to improve access to fresh,
healthy foods in underserved rural areas.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $500,000 for the
Healthy Food Financing Initiative and notes the funding provided
through the American Rescue Plan Act.
RURAL UTILITIES SERVICE
The Rural Utilities Service was established under the Federal
Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganiza-
tion Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354). RUS administers the elec-
tric and telephone programs of the former Rural Electrification Ad-
ministration and the water and waste programs of the former
Rural Development Administration.
RURAL WATER AND WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $478,487,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 443,776,000
The water and waste disposal program is authorized by sections
306, 306A, 309A, 306C, 306D, 306E, and 310B of the Consolidated
Farm and Rural Development Act (Public Law 87–128). This pro-
gram makes loans for water and waste development costs. Develop-
ment loans are made to associations, including corporations oper-
ating on a nonprofit basis, municipalities, and similar organiza-
tions generally designated as public or quasi-public agencies, that
propose projects for the development, storage, treatment, purifi-
cation, and distribution of domestic water or the collection, treat-
ment, or disposal of waste in rural areas. Such grants may not ex-
ceed 75 percent of the development cost of the projects and can
supplement other funds borrowed or furnished by applicants to pay
development costs.
The solid waste grant program is authorized under section
310B(b) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act
(Public Law 87–128). Grants are made to public entities and pri-
102
vate nonprofit organizations to provide technical assistance to local
and regional governments for the purpose of reducing or elimi-
nating pollution of water resources and for improving the planning
and management of solid waste disposal facilities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $443,776,000 for
the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program Account.
The Committee recommends $65,000,000 for water and waste
disposal systems grants for Native Americans, including Native
Alaskans, Hawaiian Homelands, and the Colonias. The Committee
recognizes the special needs and problems for delivery of basic
services to these populations and encourages the Secretary to dis-
tribute these funds in line with the fiscal year 2014 distribution to
the degree practicable. In addition, the Committee makes
$23,900,000 available for the Circuit Rider Program and directs the
Department to ensure that each State has its own staff person
dedicated to this program. The Committee commends Circuit Rid-
ers, who have provided assistance to small communities for the op-
eration of safe and clean drinking water supplies and compliance
with water regulations since 1980. The Circuit Rider Program has
long been one of USDA’s most successful public-private partner-
ships and one of the most efficient and effective use of appropriated
funds.
Black Belt Region Water Systems.—The Committee commends
the work of Rural Development on the implementation of the pilot
program to support Black Belt Region Water Systems funded in fis-
cal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. Within 90 days of enactment
of this act and quarterly thereafter, Rural Development is directed
to brief the Committee on the use of these funds.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee provides $35,000,000 for
technical assistance and directs no less than $1,000,000 to be used
to support manufactured homes.
The following table provides the Committee’s recommendations,
as compared to the fiscal year 2025:

The Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program is
authorized by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act
of 1990 (Public Law 101–624), as amended by the Federal Agri-
culture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–
127). This program provides incentives to improve the quality of
phone services, provide access to advanced telecommunications
services and computer networks, and improve rural opportunities.
This program provides the facilities and equipment to link rural
education and medical facilities with more urban centers and other
facilities, providing rural residents access to better healthcare
through technology and increasing educational opportunities for
rural students. These funds are available for loans and grants.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $95,610,000 for
the Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program ac-
count, including $610,000 for congressionally directed spending.
The Committee provides $3,000,000 to address critical healthcare
needs, as authorized by section 379G of the Consolidated Farm and
Rural Development Act (Public Law 115–334).
The following table reflects the Committee’s recommendation for
the Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program, as
compared to fiscal year 2025:

Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under Distance
Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program. While the Com-
mittee has provided the funding, recipients of CDS are still re-
quired to apply for the funding. The Committee expects the agency
to review the applications and fund projects in the same manner
as in previous years.
ReConnect.—The Committee provides $35,000,000 for the ReCon-
nect pilot, which was established in the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2018 (Public Law 115–141), and again reminds USDA
that funding should not be used in areas that are already largely
served and should be focused in areas where at least 90 percent of
households lack access. In doing so, the Committee intends that
USDA should avoid efforts that could duplicate existing or planned
broadband networks, including avoiding granting funding in areas
where another provider already has received funding from another
Federal, State or local funding program to build, has otherwise
committed to a government entity to build, or has invested private
105
risk capital to build in an area and has obtained necessary permits
to do so, even if construction is not yet complete. To achieve these
goals, we urge USDA to continue coordinating closely with the Na-
tional Telecommunications Information Administration and the
Federal Communications Commission in a transparent manner to
ensure that there is a common agreement about which areas are
currently unserved, to utilize a common map to reach those conclu-
sions that is updated each time a new funding decision is an-
nounced, and to have a clear and understandable challenge process.
In addition, while the pilot is intended to be technology neutral,
it is critical that Federal broadband investments support projects
that are both scalable and adequate for both current and future
technological requirement and consumer needs. In carrying out the
Reconnect program, the Committee directs USDA to support quali-
fied projects that will provide the highest upload and download
speeds possible to ensure rural America is receiving the same qual-
ity broadband services as their non-rural counterparts.
TITLE IV
DOMESTIC FOOD PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOOD, NUTRITION, AND
CONSUMER SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,127,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,127,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Con-
sumer Services provides direction and coordination in carrying out
the laws enacted by the Congress with respect to the Department’s
nutrition assistance activities. The Office has oversight and man-
agement responsibilities for the Food and Nutrition Service [FNS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,127,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Con-
sumer Services.
Application Process.—The Committee is concerned that the appli-
cation process for organizations which participate in both the Sum-
mer Food Service Program and the Child and Adult Care Food Pro-
gram diverts resources away from serving people in need. The
Committee directs USDA to determine ways to streamline the ap-
plication process to reduce the administrative burden to providers.
USDA is specifically directed to consider allowing organizations in
good standing for 3 years participating in both programs to file
only one application to administer both programs each year.
Communication.—The Committee is committed to supporting the
mission and values of the Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services
at the USDA, including through critical investment in nutrition
programs to support the American people. The Committee directs
the FNCS to provide quarterly briefings to the Committee, which
should commence 30 days after the enactment of this act and con-
tinue quarterly, to provide updates on key nutrition programs, in-
cluding participation.
Meals-to-You.—The Committee recognizes the benefits the Meals-
to-You [MTY] demonstration program has had in reducing food in-
security, particularly for children and youth in rural and frontier
areas who are unable to access congregate feeding sites. The Com-
mittee encourages FNS to continue providing meal delivery serv-
ices through the MTY demonstration project through a grant or co-
operative agreement to a non-profit provider that works with local
service institutions to enroll eligible low-income children.
FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE
The Food and Nutrition Service represents an organizational ef-
fort to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in this country. Nutri-
(106)
107
tion assistance programs provide access to a nutritionally adequate
diet for low-income individuals and families and encourage better
eating patterns among the Nation’s children. These programs in-
clude:
Child Nutrition Programs [CNP].—The National School Lunch
and School Breakfast, Summer Food Service, and Child and Adult
Care Food programs provide funding to the States, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam for use in serving nu-
tritious lunches and breakfasts to children attending schools of
high school grades and under, to children of preschool age in child
care centers, and to children in other institutions in order to im-
prove the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and broad-
en the markets for agricultural food commodities. Through the Spe-
cial Milk Program, assistance is provided to the States for making
reimbursement payments to eligible schools and child care institu-
tions which institute or expand milk service in order to increase
the consumption of fluid milk by children. Funds for this program
are provided by direct appropriation and transfer from section 32.
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
and Children [WIC].—This program safeguards the health of preg-
nant, postpartum, and breast-feeding women, and infants and chil-
dren up to age five who are at nutritional risk because of inad-
equate nutrition and income by providing supplemental foods. The
delivery of supplemental foods may be done through health clinics,
vouchers redeemable at retail food stores, or other approved meth-
ods which a cooperating State health agency may select. Funds for
this program are provided by direct appropriation.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP].—This pro-
gram seeks to improve nutritional standards of needy persons and
families. Assistance is provided to eligible households to enable
them to obtain a better diet by increasing their food purchasing ca-
pability, usually by furnishing benefits in the form of electronic ac-
cess to funds. The program includes Nutrition Assistance to Puerto
Rico [NAP]. The program also includes the Food Distribution Pro-
gram on Indian Reservations [FDPIR], which provides nutritious
agricultural commodities to low-income persons living on or near
Indian reservations who choose not to participate in SNAP.
Commodity Assistance Program [CAP].—This program provides
funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program [CSFP],
the Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program [FMNP], Disaster Assist-
ance, Pacific Island Assistance, and administrative expenses for the
Emergency Food Assistance Program [TEFAP]. CSFP provides sup-
plemental foods to low-income elderly persons age 60 and over.
TEFAP provides commodities and grant funds to State agencies to
assist in the cost of storage and distribution of donated commod-
ities. Nutritious agricultural commodities are provided to residents
of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.
Cash assistance is provided to distributing agencies to assist them
in meeting administrative expenses incurred. CAP also provides
funding for use in non-presidentially declared disasters and for
FNS’s administrative costs in connection with relief for all disas-
ters. Funds for this program are provided by direct appropriation.
Nutrition Programs Administration.—Most salaries and Federal
operating expenses of FNS are funded from this account. Also in-
108
cluded is the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which
oversees improvements in and revisions to the food guidance sys-
tems and serves as the focal point for advancing and coordinating
nutrition promotion and education policy to improve the health of
all Americans.
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $33,266,226,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 36,285,902,000
Child Nutrition Programs, authorized by the Richard B. Russell
National School Lunch Act (Public Law 79–396) and the Child Nu-
trition Act of 1966 (Public Law 89–642), provide Federal assistance
to State agencies in the form of cash and commodities for use in
preparing and serving nutritious meals to children while they are
attending school, residing in service institutions, or participating in
other organized activities away from home. The purpose of these
programs is to help maintain the health and proper physical devel-
opment of America’s children. Milk is provided to children either
free or at a low cost, depending on their family income level. FNS
provides cash subsidies to States for administering the programs
and directly administers the program in the States which choose
not to do so. Grants are also made for nutritional training and sur-
veys and for State administrative expenses. Under current law,
most of these payments are made on the basis of reimbursement
rates established by law and applied to lunches and breakfasts ac-
tually served by the States. The reimbursement rates are adjusted
annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for food
away from home.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends $36,285,902,000 for the Child Nutri-
tion Programs.
The Committee’s recommendation provides for the following an-
nual rates for the child nutrition programs.

Total...................................................................................................................................................... 36,285,902
The Committee expects FNS to utilize the National Food Service
Management Institute to carry out the food safety education pro-
gram.
Costs of Producing School Meals in Outlying Areas.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges that USDA provided a temporary increase in
the National average payment rate for the outlying areas at a rate
equal to the National average payment rate for Alaska until the
School Nutrition Cost Study II is completed and updated adjust-
ments for school meal reimbursements for these areas are subse-
quently made, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1760(f). The Committee di-
rects USDA to provide technical assistance and flexibility to school
food authorities and school staff in the outlying areas to ensure the
collection of complete and accurate data for the School Nutrition
Cost Study II.
Crediting System.—The Committee recognizes that the current
crediting system used by FNS in administering the School Lunch
Program and the School Breakfast Program has not been updated
to keep pace with products in the marketplace. Specifically, Greek
yogurt receives the same protein crediting as other products with
less protein. The Committee directs the Secretary to update the
system of crediting high-protein yogurt to accurately reflect sci-
entifically demonstrated higher protein content in strained yogurt.
Farm to School Program.—Successful implementation of Farm to
School programs requires broad-based knowledge of best practices
regarding coordination among farmers, processors, distributors,
students, teachers, dietary and food preparation staff, and USDA
professionals. Since the scope of some Farm to School projects has
expanded in recent years, the Committee has included language to
allow maximum grant amounts to increase to $500,000.
Local School Wellness Policies.—The Committee acknowledges
that difficulty accessing a variety of foods can cause significant
issues, including poor physical health and eating disorders. The
Committee directs the Secretary to update local school wellness
policy guidance to incorporate eating disorder prevention and edu-
cation into the existing local school wellness policy framework. The
Committee requests a report within 120 days of the enactment of
this act on the agency’s progress to update State Education Agen-
cies on the inclusion of eating disorders education and prevention
within Local School Wellness Policies.
Pulse Crops.—The Committee recognizes the nutritional value of
pulse crops for children and encourages FNS to support school food
authorities in sourcing and serving pulse crops.
Seafood Consumption in the National School Lunch Program.—
The Committee directs the department, in coordination with
110
NOAA, to address factors limiting seafood consumption in school
per the recommendations in GAO report ‘‘National School Lunch
Program: USDA Could Enhance Assistance to States and Schools
in Providing Seafood to Students’’ (GAO–23–105179).
Non-Congregate Meals.—The Committee recognizes that the Na-
tional School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program served
healthy meals to over 44 million students in fiscal year 2024. The
Committee also recognizes that access to such meals is critically
important to the physical and behavioral health of pre-K–12 stu-
dents and to their academic performance in school. The Committee
supports the Food and Nutrition Service [FNS] and its efforts to
provide daily free and reduced cost meals to millions of food inse-
cure students. The Committee is concerned that access to such
meals is not available to all full-time public school students and en-
courages the FNS to allow States the flexibility to explore innova-
tive solutions (e.g., EBT cards) to reach all income-eligible students
enrolled in public schools regardless of learning modality. The
Committee directs FNS to expand access to non-congregate meal
programs for students who do not have access to such benefits in
a congregate setting and are otherwise eligible for free and reduced
cost meals under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act
and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.
Summer Food Service Program.—The Committee supports the
FNS’ proposed implementation of summer meal programs as part
of its December 2023 interim final rule in response to Congress’s
direction in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. The Com-
mittee appreciates the interim final rule’s recognition that the nu-
tritional needs of children in the summer cannot be addressed
through a one-size-fits-all approach, and States should include the
use of non-congregate meal programs where necessary. To ensure
States have the resources needed to properly implement the rule,
the Committee encourages USDA to set aside funding to provide
technical assistance for up to five States interested in imple-
menting non-congregate meal delivery options for children and
families in rural areas. The Committee encourages USDA to
prioritize this funding for States interested in partnering with a
non-profit entity that has experience in implementing meal deliv-
ery options in rural areas and to uphold program integrity as re-
quired in the interim final rule.
Whole Grains.—The Committee encourages USDA to continue to
support the inclusion of nutrient-dense whole grain foods in child
nutrition and feeding programs and nutrition guidance. The De-
partment should recognize the importance of nutrient-dense whole
grains in the American diet and the economic importance to the ag-
ricultural economy.
SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS,
AND CHILDREN [WIC]
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,597,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,200,000,000
The WIC program is authorized by section 17 of the Child Nutri-
tion Act of 1966. Its purpose is to safeguard the health of pregnant,
breast-feeding, and postpartum women and infants and children up
111
to age five who are at nutritional risk because of inadequate nutri-
tion and inadequate income.
The WIC program food packages are designed to provide foods
which studies have demonstrated are lacking in the diets of the
WIC program target population. The authorized supplemental
foods are iron-fortified breakfast cereal, fruit or vegetable juice
which contains vitamin C, dry beans, peas, and peanut butter.
There are three general types of delivery systems for WIC foods:
(1) retail purchase in which participants obtain supplemental foods
through retail stores; (2) home delivery systems in which food is
delivered to the participant’s home; and (3) direct distribution sys-
tems in which participants pick up food from a distribution outlet.
The food is free of charge to all participants.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $8,200,000,000
for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants,
and Children. The Committee recommendation fully funds esti-
mated WIC participation in fiscal year 2026. The Committee pro-
vides no less than $90,000,000 for breastfeeding support initiatives
and $14,000,000 for infrastructure.
Allergenic Foods.—The Committee recognizes that section 17 of
the Child Nutrition Act (42 U.S.C. 1786(c)(11)(C)) directs the Sec-
retary to conduct a scientific review of the WIC food packages no
fewer than every 10 years, and that the next scientific review is set
to be released in 2027. Given the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans recommendation of early introduction of potentially al-
lergenic foods to infants, especially peanuts and egg, to prevent al-
lergies later in life, the Committee directs the Secretary to include
a review and recommendations for the early introduction of food al-
lergens in the upcoming review of the WIC infant food packages.
Dairy Allowance in the WIC Food Package.—The Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans [DGA] have identified dairy products as nutri-
ent-dense while also noting that a high percentage of the U.S. pop-
ulation, including WIC’s at-risk population, are not consuming the
recommended level of dairy. The Committee remains concerned
about the reduction of the maximum monthly allowance with re-
spect to milk in the April 18, 2024, final rule, ‘‘Revisions to the
WIC Food Packages’’, and encourages the Secretary to allow state
WIC directors to return to or continue the previous recommended
levels of dairy in the WIC program that were in place on April 17,

Section 13:
2024.
Infant Formula.—The Committee is concerned that Infant For-
mula Rebates for the WIC Program have become less generous
since the 2022 Infant Formula Crisis. The Committee is concerned
that this has resulted in participants having less support to pur-
chase other food with WIC. The Committee directs the Food and
Nutrition Service to provide a report within 90 days of the enact-
ment of this act, that outlines the changes in Infant Formula Re-
bates since fiscal year 2022, and recommendations so that Infant
Formula Rebates continue to meet the needs of the WIC program.
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Recommendations.—WIC des-
ignated Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome [NAS] as a nutrition risk
factor in 2017, and WIC agencies across the country actively screen
112
for symptoms of substance use, referring mothers who may be
struggling with substance use disorder to appropriate services. The
Committee encourages USDA to collaborate with the Department
of Health and Human Services on the development of uniform, evi-
dence-based nutrition education materials in order to best serve
WIC-eligible pregnant women and caregivers to infants impacted
by NAS. Uniform materials will enhance WIC’s ongoing efforts to
screen and support infants exhibiting symptoms of NAS.
Yogurt Fortification.—The Committee recognizes that the final
rule entitled ‘‘Revisions in the WIC Food Packages’’ is requiring vi-
tamin D fortification of yogurt to address shortfalls. The Committee
understands that a majority of yogurts in the marketplace do not
contain vitamin D fortification and that manufacturers require ad-
ditional time to reformulate and relabel products to meet such re-
quirements. The Committee encourages the Secretary to extend the
compliance date in the final rule requiring vitamin D fortification
of yogurts for an additional 36 months.
SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................$122,382,521,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 118,139,341,000
SNAP attempts to alleviate hunger and malnutrition among low-
income persons by increasing their food purchasing power. Eligible
households receive SNAP benefits with which they can purchase
food through regular retail stores.
Other programs funded through SNAP include Nutrition Assist-
ance to Puerto Rico and American Samoa, the Food Distribution
Program on Indian Reservations, the Emergency Food Assistance
Program, and the Community Food Projects program.
SNAP is currently in operation in all 50 States, the District of
Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. Participating households
receive food benefits, the value of which is determined by house-
hold size and income. The cost of the benefits is paid by the Fed-
eral Government. As required by law, FNS annually revises house-
hold benefit allotments to reflect changes in the cost of the thrifty
food plan.
Administrative Costs.—All direct and indirect administrative
costs incurred for certification of households, issuance of benefits,
quality control, outreach, and fair hearing efforts are shared by the
Federal Government and the States on a 50–50 basis.
State Antifraud Activities.—Under the provisions of the Food and
Nutrition Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–246), States are eligible to
be reimbursed for 50 percent of the costs of their fraud investiga-
tions and prosecutions.
States are required to implement an employment and training
program for the purpose of assisting members of households par-
ticipating in SNAP in gaining skills, training, or experience that
will increase their ability to obtain regular employment. USDA has
implemented a grant program to States to assist them in providing
employment and training services.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends $118,139,341,000 for the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program. Of the amount rec-
ommended, $3,000,000,000 is made available as a contingency re-
serve.

Disaster SNAP.—The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination
with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, shall coordinate food benefit allotments under section 412
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act (42 U.S.C. 5179) and section 5(h) of the Food and Nutrition Act
of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2014(h)) with respect to individuals and house-
holds adversely affected by a major disaster to minimize delays in
receiving temporary food assistance, improve information sharing,
and prevent redundancy of assistance.
FDPIR Pilot Program.—The Committee is concerned that FNS
has prohibited tribes and Tribal organizations that participate in
the FDPIR pilot program from including traditional food items un-
less such items replace a USDA-provided item, and prohibited such
substitutions unless the producer of the traditional food is able to
provide sufficient quantities for all FDPIR participants nationwide.
Allowing tribes participating in the pilot to source new traditional
foods from small, indigenous producers without requiring a substi-
tution will result in the inclusion of more traditional foods and help
small, indigenous producers to expand. The Committee therefore
directs FNS to allow tribes participating in the pilot program to in-
clude traditional foods without substitutions and to allow partici-
pating tribes to purchase traditional foods from producers that may
114
not be able to provide sufficient quantities to serve all participating
tribes across the Nation.
Hot Foods.—The Committee directs the Secretary to study the
impact of allowing hot foods to be purchased with SNAP benefits
at different types of SNAP retail food stores, including retail food
stores with co-located entities.
National Accuracy Clearinghouse.—The Committee supports the
full implementation of the National Accuracy Clearinghouse [NAC]
that uses a third-party electronic data matching system, data ana-
lytics, and public data to determine the correct state to issue SNAP
benefits. The Committee encourages FNS to expand NAC to all
SNAP agencies. In addition, the Committee reiterates that States
must administer a robust appeals process to ensure individuals are
not automatically removed from receiving benefits.
Online Purchasing Pilot.—The Committee is encouraged by
USDA’s successful implementation of SNAP Online Purchasing
Pilot. The Pilot, as directed in the last two Farm Bills, has proven
to be successful and was expanded nationwide during the pan-
demic. The Committee encourages USDA’s further work in this
area as it benefits recipients in rural and hard to reach areas or
those with limited mobility.
Skimming.—The Committee understands USDA’s efforts to sup-
port States in efforts to make whole SNAP recipients after they are
victims of skimming. The Committee recognizes that authority for
States to repay skimming victims expires on September 30, 2025.
No later than 30 days after enactment of this act, the Committee
directs USDA to provide a report on progress toward making skim-
ming victims whole.
SNAP Fraud.—The Committee remains concerned about data
discrepancies that allowed retailers to provide benefits to individ-
uals using fraudulent credentials, as outlined in a January 2017
OIG report. The Committee encourages FNS, as part of their work
to implement controls to address these problems, to consider how
advanced analytics is used to improve analysis across multiple sys-
tems mentioned in the report. This could include integrating data
mining and machine learning into source systems such as STARS
and ALERT, applying computer vision to enhance FNS investiga-
tions, and deploying new predictive analytics to help detect emerg-
ing fraud schemes. The Committee requests USDA to continue to
update Congress on its progress in addressing the issues outlined
in the report.
SNAP Payment Errors.—The Committee is concerned about con-
tinued payment error rates in the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program. The Committee encourages the Secretary of Agri-
culture to work with governors and administrators to address the
root causes of errors and ensure benefits are available to those in
need. This approach should prioritize deploying effective incentives
for States to reduce their error rates, to include technical assist-
ance and promoting best practices for use of technology and per-
sonnel to improve administrative processes.
SNAP Pilot.—The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a
report, within 180 days of enactment, to the Committee, compiled
in consultation with stakeholders and the appropriate State and
Federal officials, describing how any waiver or pilot program will
115
improve SNAP participant experience. The report shall include the
approximate cost, to include the administration, of the implementa-
tion of and SNAP authorized retailer compliance with any waiver
or pilot program. The report shall also include an explanation of
how the Department will communicate to States and SNAP author-
ized retailers which foods are SNAP eligible and ensure retailers
can implement and comply with food restriction requirements in
their point-of-sale [POS] systems and ongoing technical support.
Thrifty Food Plan.—The Committee is concerned that USDA’s
Thrifty Food Plan adjustment for Hawaii omits the price of food in
rural and remote regions of the state. The Committee directs
USDA to finalize the proposed rule published at 2024–27853 (89
FR 95724) to update 7 CFR 273.10(e)(4) to include the price of food
throughout the state of Hawaii.
COMMODITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $516,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 516,000,000
The Commodity Assistance Program includes funding for the
Commodity Supplemental Food Program and funding to pay ex-
penses associated with the storage and distribution of commodities
through The Emergency Food Assistance Program.
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program.—Authorized by

Section 14:
section 4(a) of the Agricultural and Consumer Protection Act of
1973 (7 U.S.C. 612c note), as amended in 1981 by Public Law 97–
98 and in 2014 by Public Law 113–79, this program provides sup-
plemental food to low-income senior citizens and, in some cases,
low-income infants and children up to age six and low-income preg-
nant and postpartum women. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public
Law 113–79) discontinued the admission of new pregnant and
postpartum women and children into the program. Those already
in the program can continue to receive assistance until they are no
longer eligible.
The foods for CSFP are provided by USDA for distribution
through State agencies. The authorized commodities include iron-
fortified infant formula, rice cereal, cheese, canned juice, evapo-
rated milk and/or nonfat dry milk, canned vegetables or fruits,
canned meat or poultry, egg mix, dehydrated potatoes, farina, pea-
nut butter, and dry beans. Elderly participants may receive all
commodities except iron-fortified infant formula and rice cereal.
The Emergency Food Assistance Program.—Authorized by the
Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.), as
amended, the program provides nutrition assistance to low-income
people through prepared meals served on site and through the dis-
tribution of commodities to low-income households for home con-
sumption. The commodities are provided by USDA to State agen-
cies for distribution through State-established networks. State
agencies make the commodities available to local organizations,
such as soup kitchens, food pantries, food banks, and community
action agencies, for their use in providing nutrition assistance to
those in need.
Funds are administered by FNS through grants to State agencies
which operate commodity distribution programs. Allocation of the
funds to States is based on a formula which considers the States’
116
unemployment rate and the number of persons with income below
the poverty level.
Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.—The Farmers’ Market Nu-
trition Program provides WIC or WIC-eligible participants with
coupons to purchase fresh, nutritious, unprepared foods, such as
fruits and vegetables, from farmers’ markets. This benefits both
participants and local farmers by increasing the awareness and use
of farmers’ markets by low-income households.
Pacific Island and Disaster Assistance.—This program provides
funding for assistance to the nuclear-affected islands in the form of
commodities and administrative funds. It also provides funding for
use in non-presidentially declared disasters and for FNS’s adminis-
trative costs in connection with relief for all disasters.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $516,070,000 for
the Commodity Assistance Program. The Committee continues to
encourage the Department to distribute Commodity Assistance Pro-
gram funds equitably among the States, based on an assessment
of the needs and priorities of each State and the State’s preference
to receive commodity allocations through each of the programs
funded under this account.
Commodity Supplemental Food Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $425,000 for CSFP. The Committee is concerned about
barriers eligible Commodity Supplemental Food Program appli-
cants, including those residing in smaller and more rural commu-
nities, face in participating in the program. The Committee directs
the Secretary to submit a report to study barriers to program par-
ticipation and strategies that States have utilized to increase CSFP
participation rates. The Committee also requests that USDA pub-
lish an update to guidance document FNS–GD–2020–0078 reit-
erating that current CSFP program flexibilities give State and local
agencies discretion to allow for home delivery, including con-
tracting with third-party delivery.
Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.—The Committee is aware
that FMNP provides fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income
mothers and children, benefiting not only WIC participants, but
local farmers as well. Therefore, the Committee recommends
$10,000 for FMNP and directs the Secretary to obligate these funds
within 45 days of enactment of this act.
The Emergency Food Assistance Program.—The Committee pro-
vides $80,000 in discretionary funding for TEFAP transportation,
storage, and program integrity. In addition, the Committee rec-
ommendation grants the Secretary authority to transfer up to an
additional 20 percent from TEFAP commodities for this purpose
and urges the Secretary to use this authority.
The Committee encourages the Secretary to identify opportuni-
ties for increasing the supply of TEFAP commodities in the coming
fiscal year through bonus and specialty crop purchases. The De-
partment shall make available to the States domestically produced
catfish fillets for distribution to local agencies.
TEFAP Local Foods Pilot.—The Committee directs FNS to con-
duct a pilot program to provide funds for States to purchase locally-
grown priority agricultural products-including fruits, vegetables,
117
dairy, meats, seafood, grains, poultry, or other commodity food
products-sourced from small and underserved producers to be dis-
tributed to low-income households through emergency feeding orga-
nizations. In piloting the program, the Committee encourages FNS
to select States that work with emergency feeding organizations to
serve geographically-isolated, food import-dependent areas. The
Committee directs FNS to submit a report to Congress following
the conclusion of the pilot to assess project effectiveness in pro-
viding nutritious and culturally-relevant food to individuals in
need, improving agricultural supply chain resiliency, and expand-
ing economic opportunity for small and underserved local agricul-
tural producers.
TEFAP Resources.—The Committee notes record demand for the
charitable food network, placing great strain on food banks
throughout the United States. The Committee encourages the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to use all available authorities, including Sec-
tion 32 of the Agriculture Act of 1935, to purchase fresh seafood,
fruits, vegetables, and other foods from domestic producers to sup-
port domestic commodity markets and to distribute to food banks
and other emergency feeding organizations across the country. To
provide a needs assessment to Congress, the Secretary should in-
clude in its next budget justification, an analysis of the food, fuel,
storage and other costs associated with distributing USDA food to
communities and the increased TEFAP administrative funding
needed to address rising food distribution costs. The analysis shall
include an evaluation of the additional administrative expenses re-
quired to serve rural and remote communities.
Wild Game.—The Committee recognizes that The Emergency
Food Assistance Program and the ‘‘Farm to Food Bank Projects’’ al-
lows for the use of funds for the repackaging and processing of do-
nated wild game. The ‘‘Farm to Food Bank Projects’’ also allow
funds to be used for wild game. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to educate and publicize to State agencies on these inno-
vative and sustainable program to provide nutrition assistance to
low-income Americans.
NUTRITION PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $177,348,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 177,348,000
The Nutrition Programs Administration appropriation provides
for most of the Federal operating expenses of FNS, which includes
CNP, the Special Milk Program, WIC, SNAP, NAP, and CAP.
The major objective of Nutrition Programs Administration is to
efficiently and effectively carry out the nutrition assistance pro-
grams mandated by law. This is to be accomplished by the fol-
lowing: (1) giving clear and consistent guidance and supervision to
State agencies and other cooperators; (2) assisting the States and
other cooperators by providing program, managerial, financial, and
other advice and expertise; (3) measuring, reviewing, and analyzing
the progress being made toward achieving program objectives; and
(4) carrying out regular staff support functions.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $177,348,000 for
Nutrition Programs Administration.
TITLE V
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND RELATED PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR TRADE AND FOREIGN
AGRICULTURAL AFFAIR
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $932,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 932,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricul-
tural Affairs provides direction and coordination in carrying out the
laws enacted by the Congress with respect to the Department’s
international affairs (except for foreign economic development). The
Office has oversight and management responsibilities for the For-
eign Agricultural Service [FAS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $932,000 for the
Office of the Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural
Affairs.
Food Chain Systems.—The Committee is aware that the lack of
comprehensive cold food chain systems is one of the main causes
of food loss and results in a significant percentage of food spoilage
from farm-to-market. Preventing food loss and implementing a ro-
bust cold food chain results in substantial benefits such as in-
creased nutrition, a safer food supply, greater economic oppor-
tunity, and increased resilience. In order to maximize the benefit
investment in the agricultural productivity of the developing world,
the Committee encourages the Department to give strong consider-
ation to the use of cold chain technologies and include the develop-
ment of appropriate cooling technologies in programs, policies, and
strategic plans aimed at hunger prevention and food security in de-
veloping agricultural markets.
Improvements and Efficiencies.—The Food for Peace program
supports American farmers by purchasing U.S.-grown commodities
to distribute as aid to developing nations, promoting food security
and providing market opportunities for farmers. The McGovern-
Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Pro-
gram provides American agricultural commodities to help feed chil-
dren and support school meals in other countries. This program
benefits both the recipients in need and American farmers by cre-
ating demand for U.S. agricultural products. The Committee is con-
cerned by delays affecting both programs. Within 60 days of the en-
actment of this Act, the Committee directs USDA, in coordination
with the Department of State where appropriate, to brief the Com-
mittee on the status of both programs, including any proposed im-
provements and opportunities for efficiencies for the Committee to
consider. The Committee is committed to working with stake-
(119)
120
holders and the Administration to ensure that these longstanding
programs support American farmers while working to eliminate
hunger and malnutrition abroad.
International Agricultural Education Fellowship Program
[IAEFP].—The Committee urges USDA to prioritize IAEFP grants
to multi-year programs or to continue existing programs, including
programs previously awarded IAEFP funds. Further, the Com-
mittee is concerned about regional limitations on eligible programs
in previous funding opportunities and encourages USDA to avoid
limiting eligibility of applicants to specific countries or regions.
Market Access Program [MAP] and Foreign Market Development
Program [FMD] Reporting.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to publish an annual report describing the recipients of
funds, including the quantity and specific uses of such funding
awards, granted through MAP and FMD for the purpose of pro-
moting agricultural sales in Cuba, to ensure compliance with Sec.
3201 of Public Law 115–334.
Peanut Exports.—The Committee remains concerned with per-
sistent non-tariff trade barriers faced by the domestic peanut in-
dustry when attempting to export peanuts to the European Union.
The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize inter-
agency coordination with the Office of the United States Trade
Representative and industry engagement in order to develop effec-
tive and lasting solutions that will allow increased market access
for domestic peanuts into the European Union.
Pecan Exports.—The Committee directs the Department to
prioritize interagency coordination and industry engagement to de-
velop effective strategies to allow for increased market access of do-
mestic pecans into India.
Reimbursements.—The Committee is concerned by the adminis-
tration’s delays in providing reimbursements for activities pre-
viously performed to partners in the distribution of foreign food as-
sistance. The Secretary is directed to consult with the Secretary of
State on ways to best improve timeliness within the reimburse-
ment process and improve the agency’s payments system to elimi-
nate delays in the future. The Secretary is further required to pro-
vide a report to the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this
act on progress related to this directive.

The Foreign Agricultural Service was established March 10,
1953, by Secretary’s Memorandum No. 1320, supplement 1. Public
Law 83–690, approved August 28, 1954, transferred the agricul-
tural attache´s from the Department of State to FAS.
The mission of FAS overseas is to represent U.S. agricultural in-
terests, promote export of domestic farm products, improve world
trade conditions, and report on agricultural production and trade
in foreign countries. FAS staff are stationed at 98 offices around
the world, where they provide expertise in agricultural economics
and marketing, as well as attache´ services.
FAS carries out several export assistance programs to counter
the adverse effects of unfair trade practices by competitors on U.S.
agricultural trade. The Market Access Program [MAP] conducts
both generic and brand-identified promotional programs in conjunc-
tion with nonprofit agricultural associations and private firms fi-
nanced through reimbursable CCC payments.
The General Sales Manager was established pursuant to section
5(f) of the charter of the Commodity Credit Corporation and 15
U.S.C. 714–714p. The funds allocated to the General Sales Man-
ager are used for conducting the following programs: (1) CCC Ex-
port Credit Guarantee Program (GSM–102), including facilities fi-
nancing guarantees; (2) Food for Peace; (3) section 416b Overseas
Donations Program; (4) Market Access Program; and (5) programs
authorized by the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (Pub-
lic Law 87–155) including barter, export sales of most CCC-owned
commodities, export payments, and other programs as assigned to
encourage and enhance the export of U.S. agricultural commodities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends $227,330 for the Foreign Agricul-
tural Service.
Borlaug Fellows Program.—The Committee provides no less than
$4,000,000 for the Borlaug International Agricultural Science and
Technology Fellows Program. This program provides training for
international scientists and policymakers from selected developing
countries. The fellows work closely with U.S. specialists in their
fields of expertise and apply that knowledge in their home coun-
tries. The Committee recognizes the importance of this program in
helping developing countries strengthen their agricultural practices
and food security.
Cochran Fellowship Program.—The Committee provides no less
than $5,000,000 for the Cochran Fellowship Program. The Com-
122
mittee encourages the Secretary to continue to provide additional
support for the program through the CCC Emerging Markets Pro-
gram.
Disparate Effect of Hunger on Women and Girls.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges the disparate impact of hunger on women and
girls and the fact of the 333 million people who are severely hungry
in the world right now, nearly 60 percent are women and girls.
Furthermore, it is recognized that women are more likely than men
to report food insecurity in almost 2/3 of countries and are more
likely to suffer health conditions due to lack of nutrition, such as
anemia. The Committee, therefore, encourages the Secretary to
make women and girls a priority in the Food for Peace Title II pro-
gram as they often eat last and least while sacrificing for their
families.
Food for Peace.—For over 70 years the Food for Peace program
has fed millions across the world and been a stabilizing force for
good in struggling countries. Not only does the program feed vul-
nerable populations, it helps sustain the U.S. agriculture commu-
nity by requiring only U.S. grown commodities be used in the pro-
gram. The world is seeing unprecedented hunger in many areas of
the world and the Committee does not believe now is the time to
under fund this vital program.
Quarterly Reports.—The Secretary is directed, in consultation
with the Secretary of State , to provide to the Committee a quar-
terly report on obligations and current balances of Food for Peace
Title II grants. This report should also include any supplemental
funding.
FOOD FOR PEACE TITLE II GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,619,107,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,500,000,000
Commodities Supplied in Connection With Dispositions Abroad
(Title II) (7 U.S.C. 1721–1726).—Commodities are supplied without
cost through foreign governments to combat malnutrition and to
meet famine and other emergency requirements. Commodities are
also supplied for non-emergencies through public and private agen-
cies, including intergovernmental organizations. The CCC pays
ocean freight on shipments under this title and may also pay over-
land transportation costs to a landlocked country, as well as inter-
nal distribution costs in emergency situations. The funds appro-
priated for title II are made available to private voluntary organi-
zations and cooperatives to assist these organizations in meeting
administrative and related costs.
Food for Peace Interagency Review and Report.—The Committee
provides $1,000,000 and directs the Foreign Agricultural Service
[FAS] within the Department of Agriculture [USDA] to work with
the U.S. Agency for International Development [USAID] on an
interagency review and report to Congress that outlines the process
and needs within the USDA to operate the Food for Peace program
should Congress direct such a transfer of administration from
USAID to USDA. For the past 70 years, American farmers have
helped combat international hunger through Food for Peace, feed-
ing more than 4 billion people in more than 150 countries. Regard-
less of which agency manages such program, the Committee sup-
123
ports efforts to improve administrative efficiencies, transparency,
and integration of American farmers within the program. The Com-
mittee recognizes additional capacity at the USDA may be needed
to support a seamless transition between agencies should Congress
transfers the program administration. The Committee requests a
report within 60 days of enactment of this legislation addressing
the agency’s capacity needs pre- and post-relocation, such as space
requirements, IT infrastructure, and staffing levels and staff exper-
tise, ensuring the relocation supports efficient operations, as well
as a comparison to the operation of the program at USAID in fiscal
year 2024. Specifically, the Committee directs that the report in-
clude:
—Justification for Relocation.—The rationale behind the move,
such as cost savings, attracting and retaining talent, or im-
proving operational efficiency.
—Cost Analysis.—A comprehensive cost analysis will be included,
detailing expenses associated with the relocation, including fa-
cility costs, moving expenses, and any potential impact on em-
ployee compensation or benefits.
—Impact on Agency Operations.—How the relocation will affect
the agency’s day-to-day operations, including any potential dis-
ruptions, changes in work processes, or impacts on service de-
livery.
—Space Requirements.—The space requirements of the new loca-
tion, including square footage, office configurations, and any
specialized needs.
—IT Infrastructure.—The IT infrastructure needs of the new lo-
cation, including network capacity, server requirements, and
data security.
—Staffing Levels and Transfer of Staff Expertise.—The report
will address how the relocation might affect staffing levels, in-
cluding any potential for downsizing, hiring, or re-allocating
personnel with program expertise and must include a discus-
sion of the staffing expertise that will need to be transferred
from the United States Agency for International Development
to the Department of Agriculture.
—Employee Support.—The support provided to employees during
the relocation process, such as relocation assistance, training,
and communication initiatives.
—Operational Planning.—Protocols and an operations plan for
management of and participation with humanitarian responses
operations, including for Disaster Assistance Response Teams,
between USAID, State, and USDA.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,500,000,000
for Food for Peace title II grants.

The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child
Nutrition Program helps support education, child development, and
food security for some of the world’s poorest children. The program
provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as fi-
nancial and technical assistance, for school feeding and maternal
and child nutrition projects in low-income, food-deficit countries
that are committed to universal education. Commodities made
available for donation through agreements with private voluntary
organizations, cooperatives, intergovernmental organizations, and
foreign governments may be donated for direct feeding or for local
sale to generate proceeds to support school feeding and nutrition
projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $240,000,000 for
the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nu-
trition Program.
Local and Regional Procurement.—The Committee supports ef-
forts to build long-term agriculture sustainability and establish a
local investment in school feeding programs. With direct U.S. com-
modity contributions, projects supported by the McGovern-Dole
Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program have significantly
improved the attendance, nourishment, and learning capacity of
school-aged children in low-income countries throughout the impov-
erished world. New funding authorities would enable school feeding
programs to proactively transition from direct commodity assist-
ance to locally sourced agriculture products. The Committee directs
the Secretary to conduct the Local and Regional Food Aid Procure-
ment Project Program in accordance with the priorities of the
McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutri-
tion Program.

In 1980, the CCC instituted the Export Credit Guarantee Pro-
gram (GSM–102) under its charter authority. With this program,
CCC guarantees, for a fee, payments due U.S. exporters under de-
ferred payment sales contracts (up to 36 months) for defaults due
to commercial as well as noncommercial risks. The risk to CCC ex-
tends from the date of export to the end of the deferred payment
period covered in the export sales contract and covers only that
portion of the payments agreed to in the assurance agreement. Op-
eration of this program is based on criteria which will assure that
it is used only where it is determined that it will develop new mar-
ket opportunities and maintain and expand existing world markets
for U.S. agricultural commodities. The program encourages U.S. fi-
125
nancial institutions to provide financing to those areas where the
institutions would be unwilling to provide financing in the absence
of the CCC guarantees. CCC also provides facilities financing guar-
antees.
The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508) es-
tablishes the program account. The subsidy costs of the CCC export
guarantee programs are exempt from the requirement of advance
appropriations of budget authority according to section 504(c)(2) of
the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508). Ap-
propriations to this account will be used for administrative ex-
penses.

The Food and Drug Administration [FDA] is a scientific regu-
latory agency whose mission is to promote and protect the public
health and safety of Americans. The FDA’s work is a blend of
science and law. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments
Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–85) reaffirmed the responsibilities of
the FDA: to ensure safe and effective products reach the market in
a timely way and to monitor products for continued safety while
they are in use. In addition, the FDA is entrusted with two critical
functions in the Nation’s war on terrorism: preventing willful con-
tamination of all regulated products, including food; and improving
(126)
127
the availability of medications to prevent or treat injuries caused
by biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents.
The FDA Foods program has the primary responsibility for as-
suring that the food supply, quality of foods, food ingredients, and
dietary supplements are safe, sanitary, nutritious, wholesome, and
honestly labeled and that cosmetic products are safe and properly
labeled. The variety and complexity of the food supply has grown
dramatically while new and more complex safety issues, such as
emerging microbial pathogens, natural toxins, and technological in-
novations in production and processing, have developed. This pro-
gram plays a major role in keeping the U.S. food supply among the
safest in the world.
In January 2011, the Food Safety Modernization Act [FSMA]
(Public Law 111–353) was signed into law. This law enables the
FDA to better protect public health by strengthening the food safe-
ty system. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food
safety and feed problems rather than relying primarily on reacting
to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with
new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of
compliance with prevention- and risk-based food and feed safety
standards and to better respond to and contain problems when
they do occur. The law also gives the FDA important new tools to
hold imported food and feed to the same standards as domestic food
and feed and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food
safety system in partnership with State and local authorities.
The FDA Drugs programs are comprised of four separate areas:
Human Drugs, Animal Drugs, Medical Devices, and Biologics. The
FDA is responsible for the lifecycle of products, including pre-
market review and post-market surveillance of human and animal
drugs, medical devices, and biological products to ensure their safe-
ty and effectiveness. For Human Drugs, this includes assuring that
all drug products used for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
of disease are safe and effective. Additional procedures include re-
viewing and evaluating investigational new drug applications; eval-
uation of market applications for new and generic drugs and label-
ing and composition of prescription and over-the-counter drugs;
monitoring the quality and safety of products manufactured in, or
imported into, the United States; and regulating the advertising
and promotion of prescription drugs. The Animal Drugs and Feeds
program ensures only safe and effective veterinary drugs, intended
for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases in animals and the
improved production of food-producing animals, are approved for
marketing.
The FDA Biologics program assures that blood and blood prod-
ucts, blood test kits, vaccines, and therapeutics are pure, potent,
safe, effective, and properly labeled. The program inspects blood
banks and blood processors; licenses and inspects firms collecting
human source plasma; evaluates and licenses biologics manufac-
turing firms and products; lot releases licensed products; and mon-
itors adverse events associated with vaccine immunization, blood
products, and other biologics.
The FDA Devices and Radiological program ensures the safety
and effectiveness of medical devices and eliminates unnecessary
human exposure to man-made radiation from medical, occupa-
128
tional, and consumer products. In addition, the program enforces
quality standards under the Mammography Quality Standards Act
(Public Law 108–365). Medical devices include thousands of prod-
ucts from thermometers and contact lenses to heart pacemakers,
hearing aids, and MRIs. Radiological products include items such
as microwave ovens and video display terminals.
The FDA’s National Center for Toxicological Research [NCTR] in
Jefferson, Arkansas, serves as a specialized resource, conducting
peer-review scientific research that provides the basis for the FDA
to make sound, science-based regulatory decisions through its pre-
market review and post-market surveillance. The research is de-
signed to define and understand the biological mechanisms of ac-
tion underlying the toxicity of products and lead to developing
methods to improve assessment of human exposure, susceptibility,
and risk of those products regulated by the FDA.
In 2009, Congress granted the FDA new authority to regulate
the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products.
The FDA exercises this responsibility by protecting the public
health from the health effects of tobacco, setting scientific stand-
ards and standards for tobacco product review, conducting compli-
ance activities to enforce its authority over tobacco, and conducting
public education and outreach about the health effects of tobacco
products.

Accelerated Approval Pathway.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the FDA’s continued use of the Accelerated Approval
pathway to provide patients with unmet medical needs access to
new therapies, especially to patients with neurological diseases.
Further, the Committee is concerned that the application of the
regulatory flexibility offered under the Accelerated Approval Path-
way is not uniform between the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research [CDER] and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Re-
search [CBER]. The Committee directs the FDA to continue to en-
gage through its Accelerated Approval Council to align policies re-
lated to the use of accelerated approval and to report to the Com-
mittee within 90 days of enactment of this act on how the Acceler-
ated Approval Pathway is being administered uniformly in both
CDER and CBER, including any significant policy documents de-
veloped that facilitate the consistent and appropriate use of Accel-
erated Approval by CDER, CBER and the Oncology Center of Ex-
cellence. Congress gave the FDA the authority to ensure that the
accelerated approval pathway continues to ensure early access to
safe and effective new therapies for individuals with serious or life-
threatening illnesses. The Committee recognizes the importance of
and support for the FDA’s continued use of the Accelerated Ap-
proval pathway to provide patients with unmet medical needs ac-
cess to new therapies. In particular, the Committee supports the
129
FDA’s authority to approve therapies under the accelerated ap-
proval pathway based on surrogate endpoints or intermediate clin-
ical endpoints and remains concerned about other HHS agencies
discouraging the use of the pathway and thus patient access, par-
ticularly related to Alzheimer’s disease therapies.
Additive Ingredients in Drug Products.—The Committee is aware
that the Department of Health and Human Services has announced
plans to phase out the use of certain additive ingredients from food
products in the United States. The Committee also understands
that additional actions may be underway to evaluate the use of cer-
tain additives as inactive ingredients in drug products, including
prescription and over the counter [OTC] ingested drug products. To
ensure that the Department’s efforts to remove synthetic dyes and
other additive ingredients with no medical or nutritious purpose
comprehensively address all products available in the U.S., the
Committee encourages the Commissioner to provide a report to the
Committee listing all additive ingredients, including synthetic dyes,
artificial sweeteners, and artificial flavors, used in prescription and
OTC ingested drug products that the Department plans to phase
out the use of, as well as details on the Department’s plan to elimi-
nate those additive ingredients from food and ingested drug prod-
ucts.
Advanced Manufacturing Technologies.—The Committee encour-
ages the Commissioner to continue to facilitate the utilization of
advanced manufacturing technologies to improve manufacturing ef-
ficiencies and dependability. The Committee requests that the
Commissioner continue to encourage manufacturers of critical ge-
neric sterile injectable products that commonly experience drug
shortages to invest in innovative technologies that are effective and
sustainable.
Agricultural Water Rule.—The Committee directs the Human
Food Program to continue its Produce Safety Network of technical
agents to assist growers in conducting environmental assessments,
evaluating agricultural water, and other crucial food safety func-
tions. The Committee recommends the placement of agents should
take into consideration the top U.S. States in most need of food
safety technical resources, and mixed agricultural regions.
ALS.—The Committee recognizes the FDA’s Orphan Drug Pro-
gram is one of the few programs in the Federal Government that
funds phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials for new ALS therapies.
In addition, FDA-sponsored research can expedite ALS drug devel-
opment through innovative trial designs that can speed the FDA
regulatory processes for new ALS treatments. The Committee pro-
vides no less than the fiscal year 2024 level to support Section 5
of the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act (Act
for ALS; Public Law 117–79), which established the FDA Rare
Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program authorizing grants for
clinical trials for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The
Committee supports Sections 3 and 4 of ACT for ALS, to support
the HHS Public-Private Partnership for Rare Neurodegenerative
Diseases and implementation of the ACT for ALS Action Plan.
Alzheimer’s Disease.—The Committee recognizes and commends
the FDA for its efforts thus far in addressing Alzheimer’s and re-
lated dementias and urges the FDA to fully utilize all existing au-
130
thorities and tools to meet these critical unmet medical needs. It
is vital that the FDA fully applies current science, patient input,
and available regulatory mechanisms to expedite the development
and approval of potential treatments. Prioritizing patient access to
innovative therapies is paramount. The Committee remains com-
mitted to supporting the FDA’s efforts and emphasizes the need for
a proactive and comprehensive approach in tackling this dev-
astating family of diseases.
Andrological Health.—The Committee encourages the FDA to
convene a public meeting discussing areas of unmet need for prod-
ucts addressing male reproductive and sexual health. This meeting
will focus on identifying areas of unmet need and proposals devel-
oping new safe and effective products, focusing on products for
male reproductive and sexual health.
Angelman Syndrome.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of patient-focused drug development for Angelman syndrome, a
rare and devastating monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder. Pa-
tient and family preferences and broader patient experience data
should have an impact on drug development. For this population,
seemingly small gains in self-care are critical for patients and their
caregivers in building toward independence. Without treatments
individuals are completely dependent on a caregiver to perform the
fundamental activities of daily living such as dressing, eating,
grooming, and navigating their environment. The Committee en-
courages the FDA to utilize patient experience data to inform regu-
latory decision-making, as well as the further development of
Angelman syndrome clinical endpoints and biomarkers. The FDA
should ensure clinically meaningful improvements that matter to
patients and families are recognized in regulatory decision-making.
Animal Biotechnology Reviews.—The Committee recognizes the
role of the FDA in regulating intentional genomic alterations in
animals under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 301 et seq.). The Committee encourages the FDA to evalu-
ate and expand opportunities, consistent with existing law, to align
its review policies with a product-based framework and to prioritize
timely, science-based decisions for animal biotechnology products
that do not present new or elevated risks.
Animal Drug Compounding.—The Committee urges the FDA to
provide public clarification on the role of Animal Drug
Compounding in outsourcing facilities registered under section
503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. While both
CVM and CDER have stated in guidance documents that 503B pro-
visions do not apply to animal drugs, many 503B facilities continue
to advertise an ability to compound any needed animal preparation
in their 503B facility. The FDA should publicly clarify the use of
these outsourcing facilities to produce compounded preparations for
animals.
Animal Food Ingredients.—Animal food ingredients are subject to
review by the Center for Veterinary Medicine and animal food ad-
ditives require pre-market approval by the Center before they can
enter the interstate marketplace to be sold for consumption by ei-
ther livestock or pets. The Committee remains concerned about the
time associated with the ingredient review and approval process.
To address these concerns, the Committee includes funding con-
131
sistent with fiscal year 2024 levels and directs the Center for Vet-
erinary Medicine to improve animal food ingredient reviews to en-
able innovation and address challenges and opportunities in the
animal food industry. Further, the Committee directs a briefing
within [60] days of enactment of this act regarding staffing levels
as well as an explanation of what may be contributing to the delays
in review times.
Animal Food Substances.—The Committee understands that the
Center for Veterinary Medicine is working to improve its review
and approval of novel animal food substances that affect the struc-
ture or function of the animal through a means other than nutri-
tion but only act within the animal’s gastrointestinal tract. In some
cases, certain substances are administered orally but not directly
added to the food or drinking water of animals. When reviewing
and approving animal feed ingredient petitions, the Center for Vet-
erinary Medicine shall ensure that substances administered orally,
including boluses, are deemed to be food additives provided they
achieve their intended effects solely within the gastrointestinal
tract and meet other relevant criteria established by the Commis-
sioner.
Animal Product Terminology.—The Committee is concerned
about the increase of products, which do not include meat or egg
products, that are labeled and marketed using animal food product
terminology and related iconography. The Committee directs the
FDA to conduct a study to better understand consumers’ attitudes,
beliefs, motivations, and perceptions relative to product composi-
tion, health attributes, and labeling. The FDA shall assess con-
sumer perceptions of different terms used on labeling of plant-
based alternative products. No later than 1 year after the date of
enactment of this act, the FDA shall submit to the Committee, and
make publicly available online, a report on the findings of this
study.
Antimicrobial Research.—The Committee supports the FDA’s
work to improve the understanding of biofilms and the regulatory
science of biofilms associated with the FDA’s work on medical de-
vices, drug delivery, and public health. The Committee is encour-
aged by the FDA’s goal to reduce healthcare associated infections
as described in the FDA CDRH Regulatory Science Priorities re-
port, support the domestic manufacture of medical devices and
drugs delivery systems.
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee supports the steps that
the FDA has taken to identify and oversee issues related to AI in
drug development and urges the Commissioner to convene a dedi-
cated, cross-center team of internal experts in AI-enabled drug de-
velopment. Building on existing frameworks and programs, the
Committee encourages the agency to consider engaging subject
matter experts from outside of the agency in artificial intelligence,
as appropriate, to discuss general matters relating to the uses of
AI in drug development. The Commissioner shall provide a report
to the Committee no later than 180 days after enactment of this
act the status of the FDA’s efforts regarding engagement on AI in
drug development.
Artificial Intelligence in Medical Devices.—Within 90 days of en-
actment of this act, the FDA shall conduct an assessment of its ex-
132
isting authorities and provide to Congress a report that identifies,
if any, changes to its statutory authorities necessary for the FDA
to conduct oversight of post-deployment performance and patient
safety monitoring of artificial intelligence/machine learning [AI/
ML] based software as a medical device [SaMD] and AI/ML-en-
abled medical devices. The Commissioner’s report to Congress
should include recommended modifications to authority, law, or
policy, including an estimate of the associated implementation
costs and any adjustment in the allocation of resources.
Avian Influenza.—The FDA shall prioritize inspection and regu-
latory activities for dairy products for human and animal consump-
tion, and animal food for H5N1 virus. The Committee encourages
the FDA to ensure that the HFP, CVM, and OII are sufficiently
staffed and resourced to carry out these duties.
Bacterial Endotoxin Testing.—The Committee recognizes that
use of recombinant Bacterial Endotoxins Testing [rBET] methods
as alternatives to tests using horseshoe crab blood could provide
scientific, economic, supply chain, environmental, and animal pro-
tection benefits in the safety testing of vaccines, injectable thera-
pies, and medical devices. The Committee recognizes that the
United States Pharmacopeia [USP] chapter <86>, which includes
rBET methods for endotoxins testing for products, has been final-
ized. The Committee directs the FDA to update its 2012 Guidance
for Industry on Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing by publishing re-
vised draft guidance within 365 days of enactment of this act to in-
clude acceptance of appropriate rBET methods for endotoxins test-
ing for new and existing products. The FDA will provide staff train-
ing on rBET methods.
Biosimilars.—The Committee recognizes the FDA’s continued
work to approve biosimilars that can enhance competition, drive
down costs to healthcare systems, and increase patient access to
biologic therapies. In May 2025, the FDA approved the 71st bio-
similar product. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue
its commitment to working with industry to resolve delays or set-
backs in a timely manner so that high-quality, safe, and effective
biosimilars, particularly those that would introduce new competi-
tion, can more quickly get to market.
Biotechnology Regulatory Capacity.—The Committee encourages
the FDA to dedicate resources to strengthen staffing and expertise
for reviewing biotechnology-derived food products, including plant-
and microorganism-based innovations. The Committee also encour-
ages the FDA to assess the feasibility of establishing a bio-
technology regulatory fellowship program to support workforce de-
velopment and expand technical capacity in response to increasing
application volume and complexity.
Botanical Dietary Supplements.—The Committee appreciates the
agency’s efforts to strengthen regulation of dietary supplements-in-
cluding through the use of the Dietary Supplement Ingredient Ad-
visory List and the Botanical Safety Consortium. The Committee
encourages the FDA to further invest in research to identify poten-
tial drug interactions with botanical drugs.
Cancer Immunotherapy and Artificial Intelligence [AI].—The
Committee is encouraged by recent progress in developing person-
alized treatments designed for a patient’s unique cancer. AI models
133
specifically are becoming critically important in this effort. The
Committee commends the FDA for advancing the use of these mod-
els by issuing its recent draft guidance, ‘‘Considerations for the Use
of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for
Drug and Biological Products.’’ To provide additional clarity, future
guidance should address how investigators should incorporate time-
ly AI updates into ongoing clinical trials and development path-
ways where the drug relies on an AI output. Therefore, the Com-
mittee encourages the FDA to work with stakeholders to develop
guidance on how to incorporate iterative changes to AI technologies
within the regulatory pathway of an AI-dependent personalized
treatment.
Cannabis.—The Committee is concerned about the proliferation
of products marketed in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act [FFDCA], including products containing derivatives of
the cannabis plant. The Committee is aware that non-FFDCA com-
pliant products pose potential health and safety risks to consumers
through misleading, unsubstantiated, and false claims that can-
nabis and cannabis derivatives can treat serious and life-threat-
ening diseases and conditions, including COVID–19 and cancer.
Cell and Gene Therapy.—The Committee commends the FDA’s
prioritization of cell and gene therapies and directs the agency to
continue to modernize its approach, considering the totality of the
scientific evidence and maximizing approval pathways, especially
for rare and ultra-rare conditions with significant unmet medical
needs. The FDA should review these therapies based on current
scientific understanding and with urgency, particularly for pedi-
atric patients. To advance these efforts, the FDA reviewers are en-
couraged to collaborate with expert researchers and stakeholders to
stay informed about the latest field advancements. While recog-
nizing the critical balance between patient safety and timely access
to potentially life-saving treatments, the Committee is concerned
by the seemingly disproportionate number of clinical holds on cell
and gene therapy trials. Although clinical holds are an appropriate
regulatory mechanism, the Committee urges the FDA to apply
them judiciously and work proactively with sponsors to address
issues without unnecessarily impeding critical research by applying
clinical holds without a clear communication of the rationale.
Cell Cultured Products.—The Committee is aware that in April
of 2020 the U.S. Government Accountability Office completed a
study of cell culture products and found that because no company
was commercially producing cell-cultured meat at that time, there
was a lack of specific information on the technology being used,
eventual commercial production methods, and composition of final
products. The Committee directs the FDA to submit a report no
later than 60 days following the enactment of this act to the Com-
mittee outlining the specific information on the technology being
used commercial production methods, and composition of the final
products that have undergone the FDA’s pre- market consultation
process for human foods made with cultured animal cells.
Centers of Excellence in Advanced and Continuous Pharma-
ceutical Manufacturing.—The Committee supports the FDA’s work
to promote the domestic manufacturing of drug and biological prod-
ucts to bolster drug supply chain resiliency. The Committee directs
134
the FDA to submit a report to the Committee within 120 days of
the enactment of this act with plans to designate National Centers
of Excellence.
Chemotherapy Shortages.—The Committee is concerned by the
recent shortages of commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs, includ-
ing cisplatin and carboplatin. These shortages have hurt cancer
care and resulted in care rationing in some cases. Reliable access
to chemotherapeutic drugs is essential to cancer care. The Com-
mittee is concerned that the FDA has only included a single
chemotherapeutic drug on its Essential Medicines list. The Com-
mittee urges the FDA to continue to take appropriate action to
mitigate future shortages of chemotherapeutic drugs, including con-
sidering the inclusion of additional chemotherapeutic drugs to the
Essential Medicines list.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.—Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease [COPD] continues to be among the leading
causes of death, chronic illness, and disease economic burden in the
United States. Over 15 million Americans have been diagnosed
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and it is esti-
mated that a similar number are undiagnosed and not receiving
appropriate treatment. The Committee is aware of efforts to sup-
port development of COPD treatments for earlier stages of the dis-
ease aiming to slow progression and reduce the burden of disease
on individuals and society. To support these efforts, patient-cen-
tered, novel clinical outcome measures are needed to advance these
potential therapies. The Committee encourages the FDA to con-
tinue to collaborate with the COPD Foundation and other stake-
holders in this important area.
Chronic Pain.—Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in
the U.S. and is increasing faster than other common chronic dis-
eases like diabetes, depression and high blood pressure. Despite the
enormous burden of chronic pain on fifty million Americans, the
healthcare system and the U.S. economy, there has been limited
novel, non-opioid therapeutics approved for chronic pain in more
than a decade. While the Committee is pleased that the FDA re-
leased guidance regarding non-opioid analgesics for acute pain in
2022, the FDA has not released such guidance for chronic pain de-
spite statutory requirements of section 3001(b) of the 2018 SUP-
PORT Act. Therefore, the Committee directs the FDA within 180
days of enactment to issue or update existing guidance to help ad-
dress challenges to developing non-addictive medical products to
manage chronic pain.
Clinical Trial Efficacy.—The Committee supports the FDA’s con-
tinued efforts to require study sponsors to develop and submit ac-
tion plans for including appropriately representative individuals in
phase 3 studies of new drugs. The Committee directs the FDA to
consider strategies that would assist sponsors with how it can use
its authorities in a flexible manner and to provide additional guid-
ance to study sponsors regarding mechanisms to remedy inad-
equate progress as those study sponsors continue to work with the
FDA to overcome common barriers to participation. This includes
restrictive eligibility criteria and limited enrollment outreach, par-
ticularly in rural or underserved areas. The FDA is directed to,
within 180 days of enactment of this act, provide a report to the
135
Committee and to post on a publicly accessible website on steps it
has and can still take to assist sponsors with overcoming barriers
to participation.
Clinical Trial Guidance.—The Committee welcomes the draft
guidance under docket FDA–2023–D–1987. The Committee directs
the FDA to issue final guidance no later than 270 days after the
enactment of this act.
Clinical Trial Operations.—The Committee recognizes that staff-
ing shortages are present at clinical research sites, exacerbating
longstanding challenges to the timely collection and efficient re-
porting of clinical trial data in cancer research. The burden of data
collection, entry, and verification is high and rests primarily with
site staff, who most often input data manually. Meanwhile, the
data fields requested for developing a given drug class have become
increasingly numerous and may be complex. The Committee urges
the FDA to provide guidance to cancer trial sites, sponsors, and
contractors that both defines necessary data elements and stream-
lines data entry and verification processes. Such guidance will be
foundational in maximizing clinical trial efficiency through a tar-
geted reduction of the administrative burden currently placed upon
research staff.
Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing.—The Committee ap-
preciates the FDA’s continued efforts to adapt drug manufacturing
guidance to align with new advanced manufacturing processes such
as continuous flow manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredi-
ents [API], including the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research’s Framework for Regulatory Advanced Manufacturing
Evaluation [FRAME] Initiative. The Committee is concerned that
a current lack of clear standards and realistic quality assessment
methods for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing are creating
unnecessary risk for capital investments in advanced manufac-
turing equipment. The Committee notes the promising potential for
continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing to reduce the cost of ge-
neric pharmaceutical production and make it more financially via-
ble to increase generic pharmaceutical manufacturing in the
United States. The Committee also notes that investors and manu-
facturers may hesitate to make the significant capital investments
required to purchase continuous manufacturing equipment when
standard practices for quality monitoring and licensing are not yet
established.
Counterfeit Drugs.—The Committee is concerned by the in-
creased presence of counterfeit drugs in the U.S. pharmaceutical
distribution supply chain. The Committee directs the FDA to pro-
vide a report that outlines the challenges that the FDA faces with
preventing counterfeit drugs from entering the U.S. pharmaceutical
distribution supply chain and reaching patients. The report should
include recommendations for funding or authorities needed to ad-
dress this problem to protect public health and should be provided
to the Committee within 120 days of the enactment of this act.
Dietary Supplements.—The Committee applauds the FDA’s policy
and enforcement actions against manufacturers of dietary supple-
ment products that are adulterated or misbranded but recognizes
that more resources are needed to address products that are con-
taminated, either intentionally or unintentionally, with unsafe in-
136
gredients. The Committee has noted the agency’s efforts to
strengthen regulation of dietary supplements—including through
the recently re-released Dietary Supplement Ingredient Directory
and the Botanical Safety Consortium—but encourages increased
enforcement activities and interagency collaboration with the De-
partment of Justice to remove illegal dietary supplements from the
market. The Committee encourages the FDA to increase enforce-
ment of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act
[DSHEA], including inspection and enforcement activities. The
FDA shall continue to update the Committee, explaining how the
agency carries out risk-based enforcement of dietary supplement
product manufacturers and the resources it used for these activi-
ties.
Drug Approvals.—The Committee asserts that the FDA’s author-
ity to approve medications should be solely based on sound science
and devoid of political or economic considerations.
Drug Shortages.—The Committee is concerned by ongoing drug
shortages in the United States, including for drugs that have been
on the shortage list for many years, without solutions to remove
them from the list. The Committee directs the FDA to provide a
briefing that outlines how it is working with industry to facilitate
the resolution of drug shortages and discuss potential recommenda-
tions for improving supply chain resilience to reduce the potential
for such drugs to return to list in the future. The briefing should
be held within 120 days of the enactment of this act and should
also include the methodology used by the FDA to determine wheth-
er a drug meets the statutory standard for addition to or removal
from the drug shortage list.
Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.—There are currently
eight approved therapies for Duchenne, five of which aim to ad-
dress the underlying cause of Duchenne. One of those five is a gene
therapy. In addition, individuals with Duchenne are routinely pre-
scribed a variety of therapies for symptom management-including
three approvals for Duchenne-specific symptoms. However, a sig-
nificant unmet need remains. The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant work of patient, provider, and research organizations to better
understand the effects of these products used in sequence and en-
courages the FDA to collaborate in this initiative.
East Asia Offices.—The Committee is aware of the need for the
FDA to have a permanent presence in East Asia, outside of China,
to conduct inspections, including unannounced inspections, and
strengthen regulatory control and oversight for products being pro-
duced in that region, including devices, drugs, and aquaculture
products. Therefore, the Committee instructs the FDA to establish
within the Office of Global Policy and Strategy [OGPS] an East
Asia Regional Office with locations in Hanoi, Vietnam and Tokyo,
Japan. The Committee provides an additional $1,800,000 to the
OGPS to support this initiative. In addition, the FDA is directed
to spend not less than $5,000,000 on these efforts.
Essential Medical Devices.—The FDA issued a safety communica-
tion in November 2023, with additional updates in March, April,
and May of 2025, warning consumers, healthcare providers, and
healthcare facilities to avoid syringes that are manufactured in
China due to quality and patient safety concerns around leaks,
137
breakage, and other problems. However, foreign needles and sy-
ringes, particularly from China, continue to be imported into the
U.S. These products are being widely used throughout the U.S.
healthcare system despite the serious risks to patients and the re-
sulting erosion of the domestic manufacturing base. The Committee
strongly supports efforts to protect patient safety, national security,
and vulnerable domestic supply chains for critical industries, like
essential medical devices. The Committee directs the FDA to pro-
vide a report to the Committee on steps it will take to increase
awareness of problematic syringes from China, including discussion
of the use of domestically produced syringes as alternatives where
appropriate.
Essential Medicines.—The Committee requests the Commis-
sioner, in coordination with other relevant Federal entities, and, as
appropriate, in consultation with stakeholders who have relevant
expertise, update, maintain, and publish a list of essential medi-
cines initially developed in response to Executive Order 13944 (85
Fed. Reg. 49929) to include drug and biological products, including
their active ingredients that are: directly related to responding to
chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats and incidents;
of greatest priority for providing healthcare and identified as being
at high risk of shortage; or the shortage of which would have an
adverse health outcome on patients with chronic conditions. Using
the products listed on the Essential Medicines List, the Committee
requests the Secretary, in coordination with other relevant Federal
entities, and through public-private partnerships, map, or other-
wise visualize, the supply chains of the drug and biological prod-
ucts on the Essential Medicines List, including, to the extent data
are available, their key starting materials, excipients, and active
ingredients. The Committee encourages the Commissioner to use
data analytics to identify supply chain vulnerabilities that pose a
threat to national and health security. The Committee directs the
Secretary to submit a report to the relevant committees of Con-
gress on (1) the current status of efforts to map and analyze supply
chains for essential medicines, including coordination among rel-
evant Federal entities; and (2) the extent to which the FDA uses
data analytics to conduct predictive modeling for anticipated drug
shortages and risks associated with supply chain vulnerabilities
that pose a threat to national security; and (3) any gaps or limita-
tions in utilizing data analytics to mitigate identified risks, includ-
ing drug shortages, and increase resiliency of essential medicine
supply chains.
Expert Panels.—The Committee is concerned with panels that
the FDA recently deployed to evaluate scientific matters related to
talc, infant formula, and cell and gene therapies that could impact
public health. The FDA should assess scientific issues in a trans-
parent manner and must adhere to principles established by Con-
gress in the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Committee is
concerned that the agency did not allow public participation or pro-
vide for public comments and panelists did not disclose potential
conflicts of interest. The FDA must follow long standing practices
that ensure processes and decisionmaking are transparent, unbi-
ased, and grounded in science. The Committee expects that any fu-
138
ture engagement with regards to these and other topics will be
based on sound science and free from conflicts of interest.
Food Labeling Accuracy.—The Committee supports evaluating
whether artificial intelligence [AI] driven audit tools can effectively
assess food labeling accuracy and facilitate greater Federal labeling
compliance. The Human Foods Program [HFP] is responsible for
assuring that foods sold in the United States are safe and properly
labeled. The Committee believes that AI-driven tools will accelerate
HFP’s goal of ensuring the accuracy of food labeling consistent with
the Agency’s obligation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act to monitor and en-
sure that food labels are truthful and not misleading. The Com-
mittee directs HFP’s to report to the Committee by on the status
of its evaluation.
Food Regulations.—The Committee strongly supports efforts to
provide Americans with healthier food choices but is troubled by
the lack of coordination and transparency between the USDA,
FDA, and CDC in safeguarding our Nation’s food supply, particu-
larly during foodborne illness outbreak investigations. The Com-
mittee directs the FDA in coordination with the USDA and CDC
to provide recommendations on ways to improve interagency col-
laboration in order to efficiently deploy inspectional resources, con-
duct coordinated outbreak investigations, and provide unified mes-
sages to the American public. There are concerns that information
communicated to the public in the past may have been inaccurate.
Therefore, the Committee requests that the USDA, FDA, and CDC
acknowledge that initial hypotheses may need to be updated based
on new scientific evidence and final conclusions must be based on
robust evidence. These recommendations should also include ways
to work with the industry to improve food safety. USDA, FDA, and
CDC should collaborate with industry during outbreak investiga-
tions to prevent future events. The Committee requests a report
from the USDA, FDA, and CDC on these recommendations within
90 days of enactment of this act to ensure that U.S. consumers
have access to safe, healthy and affordable foods.
Food Chemical and Color Reviews.—The Committee directs the
Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to use robust and well-estab-
lished scientific principles to conduct pre-market assessments on
chemicals that could end up in the food supply, when such assess-
ments are required by law or regulation, and to prioritize and con-
duct post-market food chemical assessments (or reviews) resulting
in risk-based conclusions while prioritizing risk management prac-
tices as needed for chemicals already in the food supply. The Com-
mittee directs the FDA to proceed through a post-market review
assessment of color additives authorized by the FDA under the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [FD&C Act) before the removal of
any use authorizations other than removal based on industry aban-
donment or where such color additives are deemed unsafe by law.
The Committee is aware of potential impacts to the U. S. food sup-
ply chain of any widespread phase out on color additives authorized
by FDA under the FD&C Act and directs the FDA, in consultation
with other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate, to en-
sure that any changes will not significantly disrupt the U.S. food
supply while considering any phase outs of ingredients.
139
Food Safety Modernization Act Outreach to Small Farmers.—The
Committee directs that of the of the funding provided for the
Human Foods Program and related field activities in the Office of
Inspections and Investigations, no less than the fiscal year 2025
amount shall be provided to support outreach, training, and tech-
nical assistance to farmers, including small farmers, to assist them
in meeting the requirements of the Food Safety Modernization Act.
Field Based Prevention Strategies.—The Committee directs the
FDA Center for Excellence to continue to dedicate funds as nec-
essary to develop field-based prevention strategies for the fresh
produce industry.
Foreign Approved Drugs.—The Committee supports efforts to in-
crease the tools available to the FDA to ensure the timely approval
of lifesaving drugs and encourages the FDA to examine opportuni-
ties to facilitate submission of marketing applications by manufac-
turers of drugs with marketing authorization in countries listed in
21 U.S.C. 382, Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act section
802(b), but which are not approved in the United States.
Foreign Medical Device Inspections.—The Committee is con-
cerned about medical device recalls from foreign facilities and di-
rects the FDA to strengthen its foreign inspection pilot programs
to include medical device inspections. The FDA should identify
what, if anything, is needed to increase unannounced inspections
of overseas drug and device manufacturers, with emphasis on fa-
cilities in China and India where quality issues are most prevalent.
The FDA should enhance inspector language capabilities, techno-
logical resources, and staffing levels across both programs. The
Committee expects the FDA to report within 180 days on concrete
steps taken to integrate and improve these inspection programs, in-
cluding unified metrics on inspection frequency, violation rates,
and progress in eliminating the backlog of uninspected facilities.
The report shall detail specific measures that are available if ef-
forts to conceal violations during inspections are discovered and en-
sure imported drugs and devices consistently meet U.S. safety
standards.
Grain Reconditioning.—The Committee is aware of delays in the
FDA’s approval for a reconditioning process after the Federal Grain
Inspection Service [FGIS] has determined the inspected grain at
export facilities to be Distinct Low Quality. The Committee directs
the FDA and USDA to update their Memorandum of Under-
standing [MOU] regarding their respective timely responsibilities
in the inspection and standardization of grain, rice, pulses, and
food products, to allow pre-approved reconditioning plans for lost/
sublots of grain that are found actionable for specific conditions. In
updating the MOU, the Committee directs the FDA and USDA to
consult with key stakeholders, including industry.
Golden Sea Bream.—In order to improve access to Stenotomus
chrysops outside of New England, the Committee encourages the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs to begin the process of adding
‘‘Golden Sea Bream’’ as an acceptable market name for Stenotomus
chrysops within 180 days of the enactment of this act.
Hawaii Coffee.—The Committee includes bill language regarding
Hawaii Grown Coffee and directs the FDA to update its Beverages
and Beverage Materials guidance and any other relevant guid-
140
ance’s to clarify or add any additional food safety issues that may
arise due to this change within 180 days of enactment.
Heavy Metals in Baby Food.—The Committee is concerned that
lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury are often present in dangers
quantities in foods intended for consumption by infants and tod-
dlers and encourages the FDA to coordinate with the USDA to en-
sure that a wide variety of healthy nutritious foods remain avail-
able to participants of Federal nutrition programs.
Highly Sensitized Kidney Transplant Patients.—The Committee
recognizes that highly sensitized patients, who comprise 10–30 per-
cent of the kidney transplant waiting list, face severe challenges in
finding compatible donor organs. These patients experience signifi-
cantly higher rejection rates compared to non-sensitized patients,
and many remain on dialysis for extended periods. The Committee
notes that current desensitization protocols, while promising, still
face challenges with antibody rebound and high rejection rates. The
Committee directs the FDA to submit a report within 180 days
after enactment of this act detailing strategies to facilitate the de-
velopment and approval of desensitization therapies, ensure the
safety of medications used in desensitization protocols, and improve
long-term outcomes for highly sensitized patients.
Hiring Freeze Related to Scientists and Product Reviewers.—The
Committee is concerned about hiring restrictions in place at the
FDA for scientists, product reviewers, and inspectors. As the FDA
continues necessary modernization to meet the needs of the fast-
paced development of innovation in the United States, a key com-
ponent is ensuring its workforce has the up-to-date expertise to
meet those needs. The FDA is a science-based regulatory agency
whose crucial mission is to protect and promote public health;
which is heavily reliant on the expertise and contributions of its
scientific staff. The FDA’s scientists are at the forefront of regu-
latory science, which involves developing new tools, standards, and
approaches to assess regulated products. Their technical expertise
is essential for keeping pace with scientific and technological ad-
vancements and improving public health outcomes. The FDA’s
inspectorate is on the front lines of safeguarding public health by
verifying that facilities and products comply with Federal laws and
regulations. Inspections help to identify potential hazards and non-
compliance issues before they escalate into public health crises, like
outbreaks of foodborne illness. By inspecting manufacturing proc-
esses and assessing product quality, inspectors ensure that drugs,
medical devices, and other regulated products meet rigorous safety
and efficacy standards. The Committee is aware of the challenges
facing recruitment and retention of qualified candidates for these
positions and directs the FDA to remove the hiring restrictions in
place for these key roles within 30 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee provides that no department or agency funded in
this or any other appropriations Acts, including prior year Acts,
may continue the freeze on the hiring of Federal civilian employees
imposed by the Presidential Memorandum dated January 20, 2025
(Hiring Freeze), and extended in the Presidential Memorandum
dated April 15, 2025 (Extension of Hiring Freeze), for scientists,
product reviewers, and inspectors at the FDA: Provided, That, not-
withstanding any merit hiring plan that either has been adopted
141
or is adopted subsequent to the date of enactment of this act pursu-
ant to Executive Order 14710 of January 20, 2025 (Reforming the
Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Serv-
ice), any such hiring of scientists, product reviewers, and inspectors
at the FDA shall be exempted from the hiring freeze pursuant to
this section within 30 days of the date enactment of this act: Pro-
vided further, That any further extension of the hiring freeze re-
ferred to in this section that occurs subsequent to the date of enact-
ment of this act shall not apply to scientists, product reviewers,
and inspectors at the FDA.
HIV Self-Testing.—The Committee supports advancement of
technologies that enable rapid self-testing for HIV, particularly
those technologies that detect HIV in patients on current or future
therapeutics and vaccines. The Committee notes the critical impor-
tance of having such self-testing technologies available before HIV
vaccines reach the market in order to eliminate false positive re-
sults with current tests and to support vaccine adoption. The Com-
mittee encourages the FDA to prioritize meritorious proposals to
bring these important tests to market.
Homeopathy.—The Committee understands the importance of ho-
meopathic medicines for millions of users. Consumers access and
safety to these products are best ensured by implementing a legal
pathway that includes homeopathic specific standards for the regu-
lation of these medicines. The Committee understands the FDA is
limited to enforcing pharmaceutical specific standards when taking
enforcement action against products labeled as homeopathic. The
FDA’s interpretation of the law that all homeopathic medicines are
unapproved new drugs that are illegally marketed has created con-
fusion both for the homeopathic community and enforcement offi-
cials. The Committee directs the FDA to work with the homeo-
pathic community with regards to the regulation of these medi-
cines.
HPV Self-Sampling.—One in four women in the United States do
not receive regular cervical cancer screenings, with more than half
of cervical cancer diagnoses occurring in women who are not
screened. While there are many barriers to screening, some of the
top include fear of the procedure, embarrassment, or lack of time
or transportation. The Committee encourages the FDA to exercise
the use of regulatory authorities to expedite innovation related to
at-home self-collection tests that could increase and expand access
to screenings for women and address a persistent cancer health
disparity for women who are never screened or under-screened.
Human Drug Review Performance Trends.—The concurrent in-
vestment of discretionary resources and Prescription Drug User
Fee Act [PDUFA] Program funds has resulted in a successful pro-
gram for over three decades enabling faster review times in the
United States, thus allowing the American people to gain quicker
access to the FDA approved prescription drugs. The Committee is
aware of a recent decrease in the FDA first cycle approval rates
[FCA] with an increasing number of Complete Response Letters
[CRLs] being issued to drug manufacturers. This decline is ob-
served across all human drug review programs, including novel
drug approvals. To keep with the stated goals within the PDUFA
Performance Goals to increase the first cycle approval rate for
142
medicines that are ultimately approved, the Committee directs the
FDA to provide a report to the Committee with an analysis of how
issues that led to CRLs for medicines over the past 5 years could
have been resolved within the first review cycle. This analysis
should assess issues relating to both the FDA and sponsor company
responsibilities and make recommendations on: how sponsors and
the FDA can work better on timely identification and resolution of
potential issues; the extent to which and how the global pandemic
impacted performance and FCAs between February 2020 to May
2023; and how challenges in the human drug review process may
be resolved with the ultimate goal of increasing FCA rates and
faster patient access to safe and effective prescription drugs.
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy.—The Committee recognizes
the lack of any pharmaceutical treatment for infants born with
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy [HIE], a rare brain injury due to
insufficient cerebral oxygen and blood flow. While HIE injuries
tragically takes the lives of many newborns, of the surviving ba-
bies, approximately 25 percent will endure significant and lifelong
neurological disability. HIE is a leading cause of physical and cog-
nitive deficits, including recurrent seizures and cerebral palsy. Due
to the severity of the condition, long-term impact on the patients,
and high cost to healthcare, the Committee encourages the FDA to
consider endpoints for clinical trials that may predict improve-
ments in neurodevelopmental outcomes and expedite therapeutic
development for HIE.
Illegal Import of Unapproved New Drugs.—The Committee ex-
presses deep concern over the health risks posed by illegal importa-
tion of unapproved and misbranded drugs, particularly through
third-party brokers facilitating access via employer-sponsored
health plans. These unapproved drugs lack the FDA’s oversight,
potentially containing incorrect dosages, unknown ingredients, or
contaminants, which can lead to serious health consequences, espe-
cially for vulnerable populations with conditions like HIV, cancer,
or hepatitis. The substitution of an FDA-approved medications with
unapproved versions can cause patient confusion, medication er-
rors, and negatively impact treatment outcomes, as healthcare pro-
viders may unknowingly base decisions on patients’ responses to
these unregulated drugs. Furthermore, sourcing from uninspected
and unregulated supply chains increases the risk of receiving adul-
terated or improperly stored medications. Given these significant
dangers, the Committee directs the FDA to provide a comprehen-
sive report within 180 days, addressing various aspects of this
issue, including safety risks, verification challenges, enforcement
actions, and recommendations for strengthening oversight. This ac-
tion is critical to protect U.S. consumers from the potential harm
of unapproved and misbranded drugs circumventing regulatory
safeguards.
Imported Shrimp Safety and Inspection Pilot Program.—The
Committee commends and supports the FDA’s ongoing efforts to
implement and increase its oversight and the regulation of the
safety of shrimp products imported into the United States. The
Committee maintains the fiscal year 2025 funding levels to imple-
ment the program. The FDA’s prior reports to Congress empha-
sized the importance of increased sampling of import shipments,
143
investment in laboratory capabilities, data analytics, and the estab-
lishment of regulatory partnership arrangements with the top
three countries exporting shrimp to the U.S. The Committee en-
courages the FDA to continue the full development and implemen-
tation of the shrimp pilot program including finalizing the estab-
lishment of regulatory partnership arrangements. The FDA Com-
missioner shall provide the Committee a briefing before the end of
fiscal year 2026 summarizing how the funds appropriated have
been used and how the funds support the FDA in meeting the ob-
jectives of section 787 of Public Law 116–260.
Increased Enforcement Action Against Unauthorized E–Cigarettes
and Tobacco Improvements.—The Committee remains deeply con-
cerned about data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey show-
ing 1.63 million youth use e-cigarettes and urges the FDA to use
its full authority to address this serious public health problem. The
Committee also remains deeply concerned with the enormous surge
of flavored disposable e-cigarettes and nicotine pouch products
being illegally imported into the U.S., primarily from China, that
are openly evading the FDA’s regulatory requirements. The Com-
mittee believes these illegal imports constitute an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the public health of the United States.
The Committee directs the FDA to prioritize the use of resources
by (1) establishing a floor of $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 to
be spend on enforcement activities to ensure these illegal products
are expeditiously removed from the market and that those illegally
importing and distributing such products are subject to significant
compliance and enforcement actions. (2) Out of the funds provided
in (1), $2,000,000 shall be used to support activities related to the
Federal multi-agency task force created in June 2024 to combat the
illegal distribution and sale of e-cigarettes, which could include en-
forcement actions taken by members of the task force. The task
force shall:
(a) Include all Federal agencies that have roles or responsibil-
ities related to e-cigarette enforcement, including but not
limited to the Food and Drug Administration, Department of
Justice, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals Service; the Department
of Homeland Security, including Customs and Boarder Pro-
tection and Homeland Security Investigations within Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement; the U.S. Postal Inspec-
tion Service, and the Federal Trade Commission;
(b) Meet at least quarterly to develop and implement a com-
prehensive strategy for reducing the number of unauthor-
ized e-cigarettes on the market, including setting goals,
sharing information, and coordinating efforts where appro-
priate; and
(c) Report to the Committees of Appropriations in the Senate
and House within 90 days of enactment of this Act and an-
nually thereafter on enforcement actions that the task force
or members of the task force have taken against unauthor-
ized e-cigarettes.
The Committee is also concerned that the agency has not com-
pleted its review of many e-cigarettes and other deemed tobacco
144
products that are popular with youth and has allowed scores of un-
authorized products to be sold without the authorization required
by statute, whether because they failed to submit a premarket ap-
plication, have a pending application, or have been denied. The
Committee is deeply concerned that many tobacco products that
lack the legally required marketing authorization from the FDA re-
main on the market, including flavored products that are attractive
to youth. The wide availability of these unauthorized products is
hindering efforts to reduce youth use of e-cigarettes and other to-
bacco products. Notwithstanding the large number of premarket
applications received and resolved, the FDA too seldom completes
its reviews within the time established by law. The Committee
urges the FDA to promptly complete its required premarket review
of e-cigarettes and to deny authorization for any product that does
not meet the statutory standard of ‘‘appropriate for the protection
of the public health,’’ including denying authorization for all prod-
ucts, especially flavored products, that have increased or are likely
to increase initiation by youth or non-tobacco users. The Committee
urges the FDA to pursue all legally authorized remedies to ensure
that all products being sold unlawfully are removed from the mar-
ketplace.
Infant Formula.—The Committee remains concerned about the
domestic production of infant formula after the 2022 infant formula
crisis and that since the 2022 crisis, there have been several in-
stances of cronobacter being found in infant formula and illness
and death among babies who consumed it. The Committee directs
the FDA to use all authorities to prevent contaminated infant for-
mula from making it to market. The Committee also directs the
FDA to streamline approval processes for domestic manufacturers
to increase and expand the domestic supply of infant formula and
bring jobs to the Unites States. FDA is directed to brief the Com-
mittee on what authorities and funding would be necessary for the
Agency to take the following actions: 1) require infant formula
manufacturers to report to the FDA within one business day of
learning that formula that was processed by the manufacturer but
that is no longer within the manufacturer’s control may not provide
required nutrients or may be otherwise adulterated or misbranded;
2) require that if any testing of finished infant formula reveals the
presence of specified microorganisms (e.g., salmonella), the manu-
facturer must notify the FDA within one business day; 3) require
that the manufacturer must also promptly provide the test results
to the FDA and consult with the FDA on proper isolation and dis-
posal of the affected product; 4) that FDA to respond to such a noti-
fication and begin discussing proper investigative and corrective ac-
tion with the manufacturer within one business day; 5) Within 90
days of a report of adulterated, misbranded, or contaminated infant
formula, determine whether the manufacturer that reported the
problem has performed, or is performing, appropriate investigative
and corrective action; 6) annually report on the infant formula sup-
ply chain and efforts to improve the safety and supply of infant for-
mula, in consultation with other Federal agencies and infant for-
mula stakeholders on these issues.
Innovative Glass Packaging.—The Committee directs the FDA to
work with glass packaging suppliers and pharmaceutical manufac-
145
turers to evaluate and promote streamlined approval requirements
designed to expedite the adoption and use of innovative glass pack-
aging technologies with the capacity to improve product quality, re-
duce product recalls, reduce drug shortages, and protect public
health. Such streamlined approval requirements should address
stability testing and other relevant types of data to be submitted
in support of product approval.
Insomnia.—The Committee strongly encourages the FDA to work
expeditiously with the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] to
prioritize actions related to FDA-approved DORA class substances,
currently controlled in Schedule IV under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act and indicated as treatments for insomnia. The Com-
mittee understands that our servicemembers, veterans, and first
responders have a higher-than-average prevalence of insomnia, and
that the DEA and the FDA are currently undergoing a review to
determine an appropriate control status for, or potentially
deschedule, the DORA class insomnia treatments. The FDA is cur-
rently conducting an Eight Factor Analysis as part of this review
process to evaluate the abuse potential, medical use, and safety of
DORA class medications in relation to drug schedules under the
Controlled Substances Act. The FDA is directed to complete this re-
view in a timely manner so that DEA can expedite a review of its
findings. The FDA is directed to report back to the Committee
within 30 days of enactment of this act with an update.
Inspections.—The Committee recognizes that inspecting a facility
for a new drug application is highly complex because the FDA must
thoroughly evaluate whether the manufacturing site can consist-
ently produce the drug with the identity, strength, quality, and pu-
rity claimed in the application, which involves detailed audits of
records, equipment, processes, and data integrity. This process re-
quires coordination among multidisciplinary experts who assess
compliance with current good manufacturing practices [CGMP] and
verify that the facility’s operations align precisely with the applica-
tion’s Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls [CMC] information,
often under tight timelines and with global supply chain consider-
ations. However, the Committee is concerned with reports that the
FDA is issuing Complete Response Letters [CRLs] for drug applica-
tions due to a lack of timeliness and therefore what appears to be
a pause only to allow the FDA time to fully complete the inspection
which results in no finding of a concern. Or, a CRL is issued based
on facility inspection issues unrelated to that specific drug applica-
tion. Both circumstances could force delays in the approval process
since these inspections are often conducted late in the review cycle,
leaving insufficient time for sponsors to address deficiencies. The
Committee fully supports the FDA’s efforts to ensure that drug pro-
duction facilities are safe and meet CGMP standards; however in
order to better understand this issue the FDA is directed to report
back to the Committee on the number of CRLs associated with in-
spections, (i.e, CRLs resulting solely from inspections with Official
Action Indicated [OAI] or potential OAI [pOAI] outcomes), includ-
ing the number of those inspections that were Pre-Approval Inspec-
tions [PAI].
Inspection Frequency.—The Committee is concerned that food fa-
cilities are not inspected frequently enough to adequately identify
146
and respond to risks. Under the Food Safety Modernization Act,
high-risk domestic facilities must be inspected every 3 years and
other domestic facilities must be inspected every 5 years. The Com-
mittee directs the FDA to provide a report, not later than 180 days
after the enactment of this act, regarding its resource analysis on
increasing the frequency of inspections to every 18 months for
high-risk domestic facilities and every 3 years for non-high-risk do-
mestic facilities, while continuing other important public health ac-
tivities, including oversight of imported food safety.
International Mail Facilities.—The Committee remains concerned
about the opioid epidemic and imports of illegal tobacco products.
The Committee supports the FDA’s continued investments in Inter-
national Mail Facilities and Ports of Entry to prevent illicit prod-
ucts, from entering the United States.
Islet Cells.—The appearance of certain islet autoantibodies in the
serum of individuals increases the chance of developing type 1 dia-
betes at some point in the future. Therefore, the Committee encour-
ages the FDA to continue working with the Type 1 diabetes com-
munity on the assessment of potential diabetes biomarkers related
to islet autoimmunity, which might help inform the design of clin-
ical studies.
Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal
Drugs.—On December 13, 2016, the Limited Population Pathway
for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD pathway) was added
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act through sec-
tion 3042 of the 21st Century Cures Act (section 506(h) of the
FD&C Act). This pathway provides stakeholders, including the
FDA and industry, with a tool to help with the approval of anti-
bacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious and life-threatening
infections in a limited population of patients with unmet needs. On
August 5, 2020, the FDA published a Final Guidance for Industry:
Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal
Drugs. In 2021 the Government Accountability Office [GAO] pub-
lished a report highlighting the fact that the pathway was infre-
quently used. The Committee directs the GAO to revisit and up-
date this report and include recommendations to improve utiliza-
tion of the LPAD program.
Listeria.—The Committee recognizes that developing the Compli-
ance Policy Guide [CPG] for Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat
foods is a complex process and directs the FDA to work with stake-
holders to ensure that the CPG outlines a policy that is reflective
of the current scientific evidence and is practical to implement.
Lupus.—The Committee is aware of barriers that have long af-
fected the development of therapeutics for lupus, a disease that pri-
marily affects women. The Committee is pleased that the FDA has
partnered with researchers, industry, patients, and other stake-
holders to launch the Lupus Accelerating Breakthroughs Consor-
tium [ABC], a public-private partnership to accelerate development
of new therapies. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue
this engagement and provide updates on its efforts to accelerate de-
velopment of safer and more effective treatments for people with
lupus.
Maple Syrup Definition.—The Committee is concerned that the
FDA has not responded to the citizen petition by updating standard
147
of identity of pure maple syrup, which was received in December

Section 15:
2018. The Committee encourages the FDA to finalize the changes
outlined in the citizen petition within 1 year of the enactment of
this act.
Medical Device Review Transparency.—Within 120 days of enact-
ment, FDA is directed to brief the Committee on additional steps
it could take to improve transparency on medical device reviews
(beyond quarterly and annual MDUFA performance reporting, pub-
lic-facing databases, and independent external audits). This brief-
ing shall include information on how the Agency can publicly share
performance metrics, the number of device approvals by device risk
classification (e.g., Class I, II, III] on an annual basis, and consider-
ations for initiation of a pilot effort to publish additional
anonymized summaries of marketing applications, to the extent al-
lowed by law. The briefing shall include information on potential
hurdles, such as authorities and cost.
Medical Foods.—The Committee recognizes the unique role med-
ical foods play in the nutritional management of inborn errors of
metabolism and encourages a flexible regulatory process that would
enhance access to safe medical foods for individuals with serious or
life-threatening inborn errors of metabolism. The Committees en-
courages the FDA to continue focusing on this issue.
Medications Safety and Effectiveness.—The Committee supports
the FDA’s authority to approve medications based on the scientific
evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the medication, as well as
its authority to determine the methodology to adequately perform
the scientific evaluation.
Medical Supply Chain Surveillance.—The Committee appreciates
the FDA’s work to address drug shortages and other medical sup-
ply chain issues, but these continue to persist and cause harm. The
Committee urges the FDA to build on its June 2021 recommenda-
tions to improve transparency throughout the pharmaceutical sup-
ply chain by continuing to support the development of information
systems to anticipate drug or other medical supply shortages in
order to be able to act to work to prevent and/or mitigate short-
ages. A special emphasis should be placed on drug shortages, par-
ticularly sterile injectable drugs, which were found to be the drugs
most commonly in short supply in the Drug Shortages Taskforce its
report ‘‘Drug Shortages: Root Causes and Potential Solutions’’. The
Committee urges the FDA to partner with other divisions in the
Department of Health and Human Services, such as to expedite the
development or licensure of a coordinated medical supply chain
surveillance system to support strategies to proactively prevent or
mitigate drug shortages. This effort should include the Administra-
tion for Strategic Preparedness and Response and other govern-
mental and nongovernmental organizations as deemed necessary.
Menopause and Mid-Life Women’s Health.—The Committee en-
courages the FDA to continue outreach and engagement activities
with healthcare providers and researchers on perimenopause,
menopause, postmenopause and mid-life women’s health, and to fa-
cilitate the development and testing of new pharmacological (hor-
monal and non-hormonal) treatments for menopausal symptoms, as
well as oversight and consumer protection efforts to assess the
safety and effectiveness of new diagnostic tools for menopausal
148
symptoms, including devices that use artificial intelligence. Within
180 days of enactment of this act, the FDA is directed to provide
a report on its activities, including specific information on research,
staffing, outreach and engagement activities, and coordination with
Federal agencies.
Metastatic Cancer.—The Committee recognizes the FDA for ongo-
ing efforts to gather input and patient-focused feedback from the
metastatic cancer community. The Committee notes the ongoing
challenge identified by patients of needing access to multiple thera-
peutic option and various sites of care due to the fact that patients
with metastatic cancer often progress through multiple therapies,
and encourages the FDA to continue working to ensure multiple
safe and effective therapeutic options with varying delivery mecha-
nisms are available.
Microplastics Testing.—The Committee directs the FDA’s Human
Foods Program to develop a validated testing methodology for de-
tection and analysis of microplastics in human foods, including
standards for sample collection, sample preparation, minimum par-
ticle size, and analysis to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Such program shall, once finalized, be added to the FDA Foods Pro-
gram Compendium of Analytical Laboratory Methods: Chemical
Analytical Compendium. The Secretary shall further directs the
FDA Human Foods Program to implement a program to evaluate
the ability of laboratories to perform the testing methodology.
Minimal (or Measurable) Residual Disease.—To expedite the de-
velopment and safe patient access to new therapeutics, the FDA is
encouraged to support collaborative research with the National In-
stitutes of Health, universities, and industry, regarding the utiliza-
tion of Minimal (or Measurable) Residual Disease [MRD] testing to
assess response to therapy and predict patient outcomes in its eval-
uation of therapeutic products. The Committee directs the FDA to
report within 1 year of the enactment of this act on advances in
the science and development of products directed to the determina-
tion of MRD, that might soon enable the utilization of MRD to
serve as an exploratory endpoint for clinical trial evaluations.
MoCRA.—The Committee is concerned that the FDA has not im-
plemented key provisions of the Modernization of Cosmetics Regu-
lation Act [MoCRA], which gave the FDA additional authorities to
ensure that cosmetic products are safe for the American public. To
address these concerns the Committee provides an additional
$2,000,000 to aid in the implementation of MoCRA. The Committee
requests a report within 90 days of the enactment of this act, that
includes a timeline for undergoing rulemaking and promulgating
regulations for Good Manufacturing Practices and Fragrance Aller-
gen Labeling for cosmetic products. The report should also include
any challenges that the FDA is facing with implementing MoCRA
in a timely manner.
Neurology Drug Program.—The Committee is encouraged by the
Agency’s hiring of additional staff with neurological expertise to ex-
pand the Agency’s efforts to address regulatory challenges in
neurodegenerative drug development. The Committee provides an
additional $2,000,000 for the Agency to build on current efforts to
advance our scientific knowledge of neurological diseases.
149
New Era of Smarter Food Safety.—The Committee supports the
FDA’s efforts to bring together data from several agencies to iden-
tify and predict vulnerabilities in the Nation’s food supply chain
and enable the FDA to take a proactive approach to ensure food
safety and supply chain continuity to prevent and respond to crises,
such as the recent infant formula shortage. The Committee pro-
vides no less than the fiscal year 2025 level to continue this initia-
tive.
New Prior Knowledge.—The Committee is aware of certain issues
with domestic drug manufacturing supply chains, and that the
FDA has been previously encouraged to improve generic drug de-
velopment, manufacturing, and quality of generic drugs domesti-
cally. The Committee urges the FDA to establish a pilot program
that will apply new tools to improve generic drug development,
manufacturing, and quality. The program must be in collaboration
with academic institutions that offer strengths in assessing and im-
proving the generic drug supply chain to ensure the utilization of
evidence-based best practices.
New Alternative Methods.—The Committee strongly supports the
FDA initiatives to reduce, refine and replace animal testing and
advance new alternative methods [NAMs] and appreciates the
Science Board to the FDA’s report on Potential Approaches to
Drive Future Integration of NAMs for Regulatory Decision-Making.
The Committee acknowledges that NAMs, including in vitro tests
and computational models, may represent cost-effective, reliable,
and human-relevant advances to support safety and efficacy testing
of pharmaceuticals. To encourage the use of NAMs by industry, the
FDA is directed to revise its regulations to make clear where appli-
cable that animal toxicology tests are not required to support clin-
ical testing in humans. The FDA must provide a written report to
the Committee describing progress toward implementing Science
Board recommendations and revising regulations within 1 year of
enactment of this act. The agency should limit funding to carry out
new animal testing to situations in which comparisons between an
animal method and alternative methods are scientifically necessary
and use existing animal data and alternative methods that will re-
duce animal use in research when human data is not available.
Niemann-Pick Type C [NPC].—The Committee continues to en-
courage the FDA to increase its understanding and focus on NPC,
a rare progressive and universally fatal disease that impact chil-
dren and young adults. The Committee encourages the FDA to use
its existing authorities and pathways to meet the urgent unmet
medical need of the current generation of NPC patients, including
preserving access to existing experimental therapies already in use.
The Committee further encourages the FDA to maximize the use
of existing natural history data and real world evidence contributed
by this small patient population through existing and past clinical
studies and to continue to work with patients, scientists, and in-
dustry partners to bring to full fruition the work that is being ac-
complished through patient organizations, scientists, researchers,
and other to fully benefit this generation of NPC patients.
Office of Therapeutic Products.—The Committee recognizes the
FDA’s efforts with regard to rare disease and oncology pilot pro-
grams and other positive initiatives, as well as recent increases to
150
support staffing, especially within the Center for Biologics Evalua-
tion and Research and the Office of Therapeutic Products [OTP].
However, the Committee is concerned about the ability to consist-
ently achieve the desired level of review timeliness and quality,
and encourages the FDA to implement and apply modern ap-
proaches to keep pace with the science. Specifically, the Committee
encourages OTP to facilitate reviewers’ understanding of the cur-
rent scientific consensus and disease-specific considerations for cur-
rent and future programs through consultation with subject matter
experts, both internal and external to the FDA. The Committee is
also concerned about insufficient patient and expert input when
weighing benefits and risks of potentially life changing or lifesaving
new treatments. Further, the Committee is concerned that despite
Congress recently reinforcing the FDA’s flexibilities and toolkit re-
lated to rare disease and unmet need, OTP is not fully utilizing
these flexibilities and tools as Congress intended. The Committee
notes the importance of use of these flexibilities and tools, as ap-
propriate, and expects a briefing to the Committee on interim
measures of progress within 1 year of enactment.
OIG Report on Infant Formula.—The Committee is concerned by
the findings of the HHS Office of Inspector General’s report on the
FDA’s response to the infant formula crisis (A–01–22–01502). The
Committee directs the FDA to provide the Committee with quar-
terly briefings on changes the FDA has made as a result of the
findings to improve inspections, recalls, and administrative re-
sponses within the FDA. The Committee also directs the FDA to
provide a report, within 90 days of enactment of this act, outlining
any statutory changes needed to fully implement the findings from
the report.
Over-the-Counter Tests.—The Committee remains concerned for
Americans lacking equitable access to health care. Diagnostics have
proven to be a critical component in protecting public health-miti-
gating the spread of infectious disease, as well as informing treat-
ment options- still access remains limited. The Committee is aware
of existing over-the-counter [OTC] diagnostic tests that would im-
prove accessibility for Americans, and encourage more frequent
testing of common infections, providing an overall benefit to public
health. Therefore, the Committee encourages the FDA to prioritize
the premarket review of OTC tests which target the most common
viral and bacterial threats, particularly to address infections for
which there is no OTC diagnostic currently authorized, when they
meet the FDA’s standards. Additionally, the Committee directs
that no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act, the
agency provides a report on the FDA’s efforts to expand access to
OTC diagnostics, including an update on submissions in general for
these tests, with special attention to products that address infec-
tions for which there is no OTC diagnostic currently authorized.
Oversight Activities.—The Committee provides $1,500,000 for the
HHS Office of Inspector General specifically for oversight of the
FDA’s activities. The Committee also directs the HHS Office of In-
spector General to determine how the workforce reductions at the
Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA will affect the mission and
delivery of services by the Center as agreed to under the current
user fee agreements. Within 1 year of the enactment of this act, the
151
HHS OIG shall brief the Committees on Appropriations in the Sen-
ate and House of Representatives about their work on this topic.
Oversight on FDA Inspections.—The FDA often takes several cy-
cles of review to approve drugs and biologics that are safe and ef-
fective. Pharmaceuticals or biologics often take several review cy-
cles to be approved due to questions about the quality of their man-
ufacturing, which often takes place overseas. The Committee di-
rects the FDA to submit a report of the impact of the location of
manufacturing sites, and the FDA’s ability to conduct inspections,
on the rate of first cycle approvals.
Pacific Snapper.—The Committee includes bill language regard-
ing Pacific Snapper and directs the FDA to update its Fish and
Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance or any other rel-
evant guidance to clarify or add any additional food safety issues
that may arise due to this change within 180 days of enactment.
Patient Medication Information.—The FDA is directed to finalize
the proposed rule for Patient Medication Information [PMI] with
an option for pharmacies to deliver PMI electronically to enhance
patient choice, education, and medication adherence for prescrip-
tion drugs. This standardized information will provide patients
with clear, concise, and accessible information about their medica-
tions, including drug names, important safety information, common
side effects, and directions for use. The availability of PMI in elec-
tronic format may offer users features like adjustable text size and
language options to improve comprehension for a diverse patient
population. Importantly, patients will always have the choice of
paper information, ensuring all patients have access to their pre-
ferred format of medication information.
Pasteurized Orange Juice.—The Committee is concerned that
pests, disease and hurricanes are having a devastating impact on
Florida’s citrus growers and processors. These circumstances have
resulted in a natural decline in the Brix level for Florida’s mature
oranges, with no known adverse health consequences for con-
sumers. The Committee believes it is necessary to provide for ana-
lytical deviation in the minimum Brix level for pasteurized orange
juice to account for these naturally occurring growing conditions.
The Committee strongly encourages both USDA and the FDA to ex-
pedite work with Florida’s citrus growers and processors, and other
stakeholders as necessary, to consider additional flexibility by mod-
ernizing requirements for pasteurized orange juice that better ac-
count for naturally-occurring Brix variation.
Pathogen Reduction.—The Committee supports the FDA’s efforts
to recommend an individual risk assessment for blood donor eligi-
bility. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue studying
how to improve existing blood donation policies to advance a safe
and adequate supply of blood and reduce stigma. Further, the FDA
must prioritize further investments in pathogen reduction tech-
nologies to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections
and safeguard the blood supply.
Patient Experience Data.—The Committee supports efforts to
identify standardized approaches to collecting and analyzing pa-
tient experience data to inform clinical research design and regu-
latory reviews under the patient-focused drug development process.
The Committee encourages the FDA to make every effort to incor-
152
porate all relevant patient experience data, including from patient
advocacy organizations, across its regulatory obligations.
Pediatric Cancer.—Many rare pediatric cancers have molecular
and genetic characteristics that are unique to children, such as tu-
mors with gene fusions, embryonic tumors, germline tumors, and
many brain tumors. Developing new therapies for such rare can-
cers is difficult, leaving children with rare tumors with few or no
therapeutic options. The FDA should prioritize the development of
a public-private partnership to assume responsibility for conducting
pediatric oncology drug development programs that may not be
possible for industry to develop on its own. A January 2020 GAO
report on pediatric vouchers recommended the implementation of
‘‘a collaborative agreement to share development risk and reward
between a public or quasi public organization and one or more pri-
vate developers’’.
Pediatric Cancer International Collaboration.—The Committee
encourages the FDA to engage more formally and extensively with
international entities to promote greater collaboration between the
U.S. and international partners around pediatric cancer drug devel-
opment.
Pediatric Device Consortia Grants.—Pediatric Device Consortia
grants provide funding to assist innovators in developing medical
and surgical devices designed for the unique needs of children,
needs that often go unmet by devices currently available on the
market. The Committee is pleased that the FDA-funded Pediatric
Device Consortia have assisted in advancing the development of
more than 2,500 proposed pediatric medical devices projects since

Section 16:
2009.
Pediatric Labeling.—The Committee continues to be concerned
that labeling for over-the-counter [OTC] single-ingredient acetami-
nophen does not contain weight-based dosing instructions for chil-
dren ages 6 months to 2 years. The Committee is concerned that
the lack of dosing information for this vulnerable population may
lead to dosing errors, adverse events, and inadequate treatment of
fever and pain. Over a decade ago, the FDA Nonprescription Drugs
Advisory Committee and Pediatric Advisory Committee rec-
ommended weight-based dosing instructions be added to the label-
ing based on scientific data; however, the FDA has still not taken
action. The Committee directs the FDA to initiate regulatory action
to add dosing data within 180 days of the enactment of this act or
issue a report to Congress every 90 days until such regulatory ac-
tion is initiated.
Pediatric Therapies for IBD.—The Committee is concerned about
the limited FDA-approved therapies to treat children impacted by
Pediatric IBD—also known as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative coli-
tis—and the myriad challenges associated with recruiting children
into clinical trials, especially ‘‘washout’’ periods or time during
which patients must abstain from therapy to participate in trials.
The Committee is aware of the FDA efforts to address these chal-
lenges more broadly, including a recently issued final guidance on
the use of pediatric extrapolation in drug development as well as
2024 draft guidance to industry focused on developing drugs to
treat pediatric IBD. The committee notes an increased reliance on
extrapolation and other approaches to support the approval of simi-
153
lar therapies to treat other pediatric autoimmune conditions, such
as juvenile arthritis. The Committee directs the FDA to build upon
these guidance documents and to work with patient, researcher,
and therapy development stakeholders to update the draft guid-
ance document on pediatric IBD based on emerging data and col-
lective stakeholder feedback and incorporating the potential use of
other data sources, including real-world evidence [RWE], in clinical
trials for pediatric IBD.
PFAS in Cosmetics.—The Committee is concerned about the
presence of perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl [PFAS] substances in
cosmetics. The Committee directs the FDA to develop plan out-
lining research needed to inform regulatory decisionmaking, includ-
ing potential development of a proposed rule to ban intentionally
added PFAS substances in cosmetics. Not later than 90 days after
enactment, the FDA will brief the committee on the research plan,
potential regulatory options, and discuss considerations and antici-
pated challenges with issuing such a proposed rule.
Plant Based Product Labeling.—The Committee is concerned
that the current labeling practices of some plant based alternatives
to animal-derived foods have the potential to cause consumer con-
fusion. The Committee directs the FDA to conduct a study to (1)
better understand consumer’s perceptions and motivations relative
to produce composition, health attributes, and labeling, and (2) as-
sess consumer perceptions of different terms used on labeling of
plant-based alternative products. No later than 180 days after the
date of enactment of this act, the FDA shall submit to Congress,
and make publicly available online, a report on the findings of this
study.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome [PCOS].—The Committee recognizes
that there have been no FDA-approved treatments specific to PCOS
and commends the FDA for supporting the Externally-Led Patient-
Focused Drug Development [EL–PFDD] meeting on PCOS. The
Committee further encourages the FDA, based on the findings of
the EL–PFDD meeting, to work with investigators, industry, pa-
tients, practitioners, and researchers to advance the development of
safe new evidence-based therapies, diagnostics, devices, and that
address the identified needs and treatment priorities of PCOS pa-
tients.
Prioritizing U.S. Biomanufacturing of Essential Medicines and
Drugs in Shortage.—The Committee directs the FDA to prioritize
applications, including or supplements, that identify a domestic
manufacturing facility or a manufacturing facility in the territory
of a government or government agency that the FDA has deter-
mined to be capable of conducting inspections pursuant to a mutual
recognition agreement, for essential medicines as identified by the
FDA and/or products that are included, or have recently been in-
cluded, on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The FDA should prioritize
pre-approval and pre-license inspections of U.S. manufacturing fa-
cilities identified in an original application for an essential medi-
cine and pre-approval and pre-license inspections of U.S. manufac-
turing facilities newly identified in a supplement for an essential
medicine or product that is, or has recently been included, on the
FDA’s drug shortage list.
154
Promoting Domestic Manufacturing.—The Committee supports
the Agency’s work to promote the domestic manufacturing of drugs
and biological products to help bolster supply chain resiliency. The
Committee encourages the FDA to increase its efforts, consistent
with its authorities, to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to
expand and relocate drug manufacturing to the United States for
this purpose. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue pro-
grams and policies that would encourage the pharmaceutical indus-
try to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies, which could
help prompt industry to relocate foreign manufacturing to the
United States or expanding current domestic manufacturing.
Psychedelics.—The Committee recognizes the increased interest
and need to study psychedelics, including MDMA, psilocybin,
ibogaine, and 5–MeO–DMT, and their potential therapeutic effects.
The Committee encourages the FDA to work with the VA, DoD,
and NIH on leveraging clinical trials to improve our understanding
of psychedelics The Committee also encourages the FDA and VA,
DoD, and NIH to work together in developing and supporting pub-
lic-private collaborations to advance psychedelic research for thera-
peutic purposes, with the FDA maintaining its independent regu-
latory authority as an observer. The Committee requests a report
on such efforts within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Rare Diseases.—The Committee recognizes that the development
of rare disease therapies offers unique regulatory challenges, such
as the small patient populations for clinical studies, poorly under-
stood natural history, and hurdles in manufacturing and commer-
cialization. To ensure that therapies for rare diseases remain a top
priority for the FDA, the Committee notes that the Rare Disease
Innovation Hub (the Hub) serves as the FDA’s coordinating office
for engagement with rare disease stakeholders across all therapies
including drugs and biologics (including cell and gene therapies),
while coordinating closely with the FDA’s center generally respon-
sible for regulation of medical devices. The Committee requests
that the Hub continue to promulgate draft guidance regarding the
evidentiary standard established by the Drug Amendments of 1962
(Public Law 87–781) and the unique development challenges posed
by rare diseases to add to existing the FDA draft guidance’s such
as Rare Diseases: Considerations for the Development of Drugs and
Biological Products (Dec. 2023). The Committee asks that the FDA
submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the enactment of
this act, which shall include summaries of relevant charters (such
as the responsibilities of the Chair(s), required participants, and
criteria for initial populations and regulatory review) and any other
relevant information the agency deems appropriate. The Com-
mittee also supports the Hub in fully implementing the 2025 stra-
tegic agenda and to strengthen the relationship between drug, bio-
logic, and device products centers and stakeholders to address
unmet needs in rare diseases, including the lack of effective treat-
ments and limited medical options for people with rare diseases.
Rare Disease Innovation Agenda.—The Committee recognizes
that the development of rare disease therapies offers unique regu-
latory challenges, especially for the smallest patient populations.
This is due to several factors including poorly understood natural
history, challenges in identifying informative endpoints and bio-
155
markers, and for certain therapies, hurdles in manufacturing and
commercialization due to population size. To help further facilitate
the development of medical products for rare diseases with a high
unmet need, the Committee requests that within 180 days of enact-
ment, the agency develop a Rare Disease Innovation Agenda to en-
hance communication between the rare disease community and the
Agency and to focus on intercenter collaboration and coordination
regarding issues critical to rare disease drug development, such as
novel endpoints, biomarker development, use of real world data,
and innovative clinical trial designs for small populations. In devel-
oping such an agenda, the Agency should consider whether dif-
ferent mechanisms could be operationalized to facilitate and en-
hance intercenter collaboration, as well as solicit public input, in-
cluding through a public meeting that includes patients, companies
developing rare disease therapies and other relevant experts. A
summary of such meeting and proposed recommendations shall be
posted on the Agency’s website.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program [RPD
PRV].—The RPD PRV program was established in 2012 and is a
longstanding bipartisan priority that has resulted in discovery, de-
livery, and development of treatments for rare pediatric diseases.
The program serves as a critical, cost-neutral incentive for pharma-
ceutical companies to develop treatments for rare pediatric diseases
and enables faster access to life-saving therapies for children with
rare conditions. The Committee anticipates that this program will
be reauthorized in 2025 and directs the FDA to maintain its focus
on rare pediatric disease therapies and continue supporting the
PRV program framework until reauthorization occurs.
Recommendations on Hemp.—The Committee recognizes the
growing consumer demand for American-made hemp products fol-
lowing the expanded legalization of hemp under the Agriculture
Improvement Act of 2018. As the industry continues to innovate
and expand to meet consumer demand, the Committee acknowl-
edges the need for clear, science-based guidance to ensure product
safety, consumer confidence, and regulatory clarity. To support this
effort, the Committee directs the FDA to solicit information from
and engage with industry stakeholders, including small businesses,
scientists, manufacturers, public health experts, academic research-
ers, and other relevant parties in the hemp community on sug-
gested limits on the amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol or other
cannabinoids in hemp-derived cannabinoid products for the pur-
poses of promulgating regulations pursuant to authorities under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq).
The Committee also encourages the FDA to seek out information
from States on actions taken to address consumer safety concerns
like cannabinoid limits and age restrictions. The FDA shall brief
the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this act on planned
engagement and requests for information.
Medical Device Remanufacturing.—The Committee is aware of
the FDA’s work on medical device remanufacturing and servicing
requirements, including the May 2024 final guidance, and directs
the agency to provide a report detailing the agency’s efforts to im-
plement the guidance. The report should outline outreach efforts
that the FDA has undertaken to inform independent servicers (who
156
aren’t FDA-regulated and may not monitor Federal Register no-
tices) about their responsibilities, including industry group commu-
nications and trade publication education. The report should also
cover the FDA’s surveillance of servicers and remanufacturers to
ensure proper documentation of remanufacturing determinations
(this shall include a summary of conducted inspections and enforce-
ment actions taken). Additionally, the report should include data
on whether the guidance has increased establishment registrations
or 510(k) submissions by remanufacturers and explain how the
FDA is addressing concerns that the guidance might be misinter-
preted to permit unsupervised device modifications by third par-
ties, emphasizing independent servicers’ understanding of their
regulatory obligations. The Committee expects the report to be
completed within 90 days of enactment with all relevant informa-
tion posted on the FDA’s public website.
Operation Stork Speed.—The Committee supports the goals of
Operation Stork Speed [OSS] to improve the safety and availability
of infant formula. The Committee urges the FDA to act swiftly to
establish and enforce clear, consistent inspection and compliance
standards for all infant formula products, regardless of their coun-
try of origin. Absent this regulatory alignment, the market risks
being disrupted by products that fall short of the high standards
set by OSS and the FDA. The Committee maintains that all manu-
facturers, whether domestic or foreign, should be held to the same
regulatory standards, requirements, and inspection levels, includ-
ing surprise inspections, to ensure a safe and transparent domestic
infant formula supply chain.
Orphan Products Grant Program.—The Committee is aware of
continued advancements in the number of therapies in develop-
ment for rare disease patients but notes that 95 percent of rare dis-
eases do not have FDA-approved treatments. The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the Orphan Products Grant Program, com-
prised of the Clinical Trials Grant Program and the Natural His-
tory Studies Grants Program. The Committee directs the FDA to
move forward in soliciting and supporting research to address rare
disease regulatory science challenges.
Safe and Effective Products.—The Committee recognizes the
FDA’s continued efforts to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
products for U.S. patients. The Committee strongly supports FDA’s
ongoing adherence to the statutory limits on compounded copies of
medicines once an FDA approved safe and effective medicine is oth-
erwise available. The demand for certain products, including
incretin medications, should be addressed with FDA-approved safe
and effective treatments, as required by law, unless the FDA has
declared a shortage and authorized a temporary, alternative source
to meet individual needs. At the same time, the Committee under-
stands the need for continued access to compounded medications
when commercially available drugs can not meet a patient’s specific
needs; including in circumstances where a prescriber has deter-
mined that an individual patient requires a formulation change
that makes a medically significant difference in line with section
503A of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act. The Committee remains
concerned that unapproved and misbranded drugs are being im-
ported illegally and directs the FDA to coordinate closely with U.S.
157
Customs and Border Protection and other partners to prevent un-
approved and misbranded drugs from entering the market, thereby
upholding regulatory standards and safeguarding the drug supply
chain to protect patient health. The Committee directs the FDA to
provide to the Committee a briefing, no later than 60 days after the
enactment of this act highlighting the FDA’s comprehensive ap-
proach to prevent the distribution of unapproved and misbranded
incretin medications into the supply chain to avoid harm to patient
safety.
School Nutrition Grants to Combat Chronic Disease.—The Com-
mittee provides $10,000,000 within the Human Foods Program
funding to support the FDA Commissioner’s priority to combat the
chronic disease crisis in the United States through a pilot grant
program to help schools transition to healthier foods to ensure the
children of our Nation are served nutritious food; including equip-
ment purchases to facilitate food made on premises and procuring
more local, fresh produce.
Shrimp Imports.—The Committee is concerned that the FDA is
not taking adequate measures to prevent the importation of shrimp
contaminated with antimicrobial resistant pathogens such as sal-
monella. The FDA’s reporting shows a massive decline in the
amount of entry lines of shrimp refused for the presence of sal-
monella even as the volume of shrimp imports have substantially
increased, outbreaks of illness from salmonella have been tied to
imported shrimp, and the agency has confirmed antibiotic resist-
ance in salmonella found in shrimp imports. Further, the FDA’s
Import Alerts 16–18 and 16–35 reflect a lack of care and attention
to the identification of companies exporting shrimp to the United
States without being detained without physical examination. The
bill provides that no funds shall be used to add any firms to these
Import Alerts until the FDA ensures that firms added to the Green
List have resolved the conditions that gave rise to the appearance
of the violation. In addition, the FDA will submit a report on the
steps taken by the agency to confirm that Import Alerts 16–18 and
16–35 correctly identify existing producers that are not subject to
Detention Without Physical Examination and are able to ade-
quately demonstrate that the firm has resolved the conditions that
gave rise to the appearance of the violation. The Committee directs
the FDA to submit this report to the Committee within 180 days
of enactment of this act and include a summary of the agency’s ac-
tions to prevent the entry of shrimp contaminated with filth, de-
composition, or harmful pathogens (such as salmonella) into the
United States.
State and Local Inspections.—Of the total amount appropriated
for the Human Foods Program and related field activities in the Of-
fice of Inspections and Investigations, no less than $116,000,000
shall be used for State and local programs.
Seafood Labeling.—The Committee continues to hear concerns
with the labeling of certain foods as a fish or seafood product when
the products are highly-processed plant-based foods rather than de-
rived from actual fish or seafood, and the labeling of these products
are misleading, deceptive, and confusing to consumers. The Com-
mittee is concerned the terms ‘‘plant-based’’ and ‘‘vegan’’ exempt
the producer from describing the actual plant source as part of the
158
product name, in opposition to other FDA guidance. The Committee
directs the FDA to provide clarity around the labeling of these
foods using seafood terminology to ensure they are held to the
same standards as actual seafood products to avoid consumer con-
fusion and aligns with the structure it has applied to the draft
guidance for the labeling of plant-based milk alternatives.
Securing Medical Supply Chains.—The Committee direct the
FDA, in coordination with national security agencies, to prioritize
supply chain security and national security when evaluating all ap-
plications throughout the new drug development and approval
lifecycle.
Smoking Cessation Treatments for Youth and Adults.—The Com-
mittee continues to recognize the important work of advancing
smoking cessation treatment innovation to help adult smokers be
more successful in quitting and the critical role of the Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research [CDER] in this work. The Com-
mittee further acknowledges the agency’s October 2024 public
meeting on advancing smoking cessation innovation which under-
scored the importance of bringing forward new pharmacotherapies
for smokers seeking to quit and the key opportunity for CDER to
be more modern and efficient in its work in this area. The Com-
mittee strongly encourages CDER to do more to modernize the reg-
ulatory framework for these products to reflect the real-world expe-
rience risk-benefit considerations, address unnecessary barriers to
advancing vitally needed new cessation therapies for patients, and
encourage smoking cessation pharmacotherapy innovation on be-
half of our Nation’s patients. The Committee requests an update
from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on new actions CDER
will take to address the Committee’s concerns not later than 90
days after enactment of this act.
The Committee is aware of alarming trends in youth e-cigarette
use; recent survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention indicates that in 2024, nearly 8 percent of high school
students reported e-cigarette use in the previous 30 days. At
present, there are no FDA-approved nicotine cessation drugs that
are approved for adolescent populations. With more than 2.5 mil-
lion young people using e-cigarettes, there is a need for develop-
ment of nicotine cessation treatments in adolescents. The Com-
mittee encourages the FDA to provide additional guidance to drug
manufacturers on the tools that the FDA can utilize to promote de-
velopment and expedite approval of nicotine cessation treatments
in adolescents.
Sodium.—The Committee recognizes the importance of reducing
sodium in the food supply. Within 90 days of enactment, the Com-
mittee directs the FDA to provide a report to the Committee on its
preliminary assessment report that will be publicly posted to its
website and on its plans for monitoring and evaluation of the short-
term targets. In its report, the FDA should detail how it will iden-
tify data sources, collect and analyze data, create a timeline for as-
sessments, and work with industry on voluntary compliance.
Sponsor Communication.—The Committee is concerned with the
FDA’s reliance on ‘‘Written Response Only’’ communication, in lieu
of live interactions when responding to meeting requests from
sponsors. While written response can be a useful tool, there are
159
times where meaningful scientific exchanges between sponsors and
the FDA is required. The Committee directs the FDA to offer face
to face or teleconference meetings when requested by the sponsor,
as discussed in the FDA’s guidance documents.
State and Regulatory Frameworks and Adequacy of Current Pow-
ers.—The Committee urges the FDA to improve data sharing and
coordination between State and Federal authorities, such as by
continuing to support the FDA’s Cannabinoid Hemp Product 20.88
Information Sharing Agreement initiative.
Steroid Use.—The Committee is encouraged that the FDA is con-
tinuing to progress in its risk benefit analysis of new treatments
for diseases, particularly rare diseases, with high unmet need and
a current standard of care that carries a potential risk, especially
for children who may be taking these higher risk treatments over
many years. The Committee applauds the FDA for applying
thoughtfulness and urgency when reviewing new treatment options
that are both effective treatment options and could mitigate the po-
tential long-term risk of the current standard of care. As the Agen-
cy continues to address risks such as radiation exposure in cancer
treatments, prolonged exposure to addictive treatments, and other
current treatments that carry potential risk along with benefit, the
Committee supports the Agency in applying the same urgency to
addressing the risk of prolonged exposure to high dose steroids,
particularly for children.
Sunscreen.—The Committee is concerned that Americans are
falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to access to sun-
screen even though skin cancer is the most common cancer in the
U.S. According to the Surgeon General, more than five million
Americans each year are treated for skin cancer at a cost of over
eight billion dollars per year. As a result, the Committee directs
the FDA to work with stakeholders to harmonize its approach with
international testing standards to ensure Americans have access to
as many sunscreen active ingredients as possible recognizing that
safe and effective sunscreen products are a proven preventative
tool against skin cancer. In addition, the Committee urges the FDA
to utilize its authorities provided under the CARES Act to evaluate
new sunscreen ingredients already approved for use around the
world and to educate stakeholders about the administrative order
process to encourage research and development of new sunscreen
technology.
Supply Shortages for Critical Medications.—The Committee is
concerned about continued reports of supply shortages for critical
medications and devices, including diabetes, cancer, antibiotic,
ADHD, and other drug shortages, which continue to pose a signifi-
cant challenge and affect patients access to vital treatments and
care. Within 90 days of enactment, the Committee requests a re-
port from the FDA regarding its implementation of shortage-re-
lated authorities, and the status of shortage related guidance docu-
ments.
Temporomandibular Disorder.—The Committee encourages the
FDA to support the development and implementation of a Patient-
Centered Coordinated Registry Network [CRN] for
Temporomandibular Joint Disorder [TMD]. This Registry will be a
critical component in the transformation of temporomandibular dis-
160
order research across other Government Agencies. The Committee
supports collaborations among medical product centers related to
the development of treatments for TMD and urges the FDA to sup-
port implementing of a Temporomandibular Joint [TMJ] CRN, con-
tinuing the developmental work of the TMJ Patient-led Round-
Table and its partners in successfully developing the Registry as an
important tool in ongoing efforts to improve the treatment and
management of TMD patients.
Timing and Sequencing of Cancer Immunotherapy.—The Com-
mittee commends the FDA for supporting the rapid implementation
of life-saving immunotherapies into the clinic. New data suggest
the administration of immunotherapies early in the treatment
timeline may be able to prevent or intercept cancers before they de-
velop into serious disease, thus improving patient outcomes while
simultaneously reducing monetary costs and physical burden. To
support continued research in this area, the field must develop
novel tools to efficiently run early-stage clinical trials. These tools
include biomarkers that can detect early disease, inform appro-
priate treatments, and/or serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints.
In addition, determination of early-stage clinical trial endpoints at
large that can characterize patient benefit are necessary for contin-
ued momentum. Therefore, the Committee urges the FDA to pro-
vide guidance on the development of early disease clinical trial
tools, including early-stage biomarkers and clinical endpoints.
Tissue Transplants.—The Committee notes the tissue transplant
industry is growing, with approximately 58,000 donors providing
tissue allografts for 2.5 million transplants in the United States
each year. Although products in this space are widely used for pa-
tients and healthcare providers, the Committee notes outbreaks of
M. tuberculosis in 2021 and 2023 that has contaminated over 100
bone-allograft HCT/Ps placed in patients, resulting in adverse
events and negative patient outcomes. The Committee requests the
FDA issue guidance identifying M. tuberculosis as a relevant com-
municable disease agent or disease [RCDAD] and providing rec-
ommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of M. tuber-
culosis.
Traceability Rule.—The Committee directs that no funding from
this act or any other act may be used by the FDA to delay enforce-
ment of the Food Traceability Final Rule (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart
S) beyond July 20, 2028. The FDA shall take all necessary meas-
ures to ensure that full compliance and enforcement begin no later
than that date. The FDA shall submit a report to the Committees
on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate
within 60 days of the enactment of this act detailing its strategies
to support industry implementation and to prepare for the FDA’s
enforcement of the Food Traceability Final Rule by July 20, 2028.
The report shall include specific performance milestones (including
progress toward operationalization of FDA’s internal Product Trac-
ing System) and an inspections and compliance roadmap and shall
describe technical assistance provided to industry. The FDA shall
submit progress updates every 90 days thereafter until the rule is
in effect. Failure to submit these reports shall not delay the July
20, 2028, enforcement date.
161
Transparency for Imaging Technology.—Foreign adversaries are
pursuing the collection and exploitation of Americans’ sensitive
health data through medical equipment. Therefore, the Committee
directs the FDA to provide a report regarding the authorization of
all medical imaging technology for sale into the United States from
entities that are based in a territory of a foreign adversary, as de-
fined in 15 CFR 7.4, or under the jurisdiction of a foreign adver-
saries’ laws or regulations, to the degree that the FDA has the in-
formation and based on the most current information in the FDA’s
databases of premarket authorizations and Establishment Reg-
istration & Device Listings. ‘‘Medical imaging technology’’ refers to
any device, software, or other technology intended for use in med-
ical imaging, including but not limited to X-ray, MRI, CT,
ultrasound, and other diagnostic or therapeutic imaging modalities.
Type 1 Diabetes.—The Committee directs $5,000,000 to be spent
within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research [CBER]
within the FDA to prioritize the development and validation of im-
proved endpoints for clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies in
type 1 diabetes (T1D), with a specific focus on C-peptide as a poten-
tial surrogate endpoint. The agency should engage with relevant
stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and patient advo-
cacy groups, to evaluate the merits of C-peptide as a surrogate end-
point and its potential to accelerate the development of disease-
modifying therapies for T1D. Furthermore, the FDA is directed to
provide clear guidance to drug developers and relevant stake-
holders on the appropriate use of C-peptide in clinical trials and
take the necessary steps to consider its acceptance as a validated
surrogate endpoint for demonstrating efficacy in T1D therapies.
The Committee believes that improving and expanding the range
of acceptable endpoints, particularly through the validation of C-
peptide, could significantly expedite the development and approval
of innovative treatments for T1D, ultimately leading to improved
patient outcomes and reduced disease burden. The FDA is required
to report back to the Committee within 180 days on its progress
in this area, including the specific steps taken to incorporate C-
peptide or other novel endpoints into the regulatory pathway for
T1D therapies.
User Fee Agreements.—Biopharmaceutical, medical device, and
other medical product developers pay user fees to the FDA to en-
sure the agency has the resources and staffing needed for timely
review of new and generic product applications, with an overall
goal of shortening the time it takes for patients to access new safe
and effective treatments in the United States. This statutory
framework was developed for patients, to ensure that the FDA’s
medical product reviews occur in an efficient and predictable man-
ner, while also supplementing the government resources, which has
been successful for decades. As the FDA undergoes its current reor-
ganization and staffing changes, it is imperative that the user fee
money provided to the FDA is used in the manner intended and
outlined in the user fee commitment letters which were passed by
Congress and signed into law. This includes the agency maintain-
ing the appropriate level of user-fee funded staff and other re-
sources. To ensure the user fee programs operate as intended, sec-
tion 779 of the bill directs the FDA to provide a report, validated
162
by the FDA Ombudsman, within 90 days of the enactment of this
act, outlining how the FDA is ensuring that the user fee agree-
ments are fully maintained and implemented, including details as
to the current level of staff and other resources devoted to user fee
commitments. Following the initial 90-day assessment, section 779
of the bill directs the FDA Ombudsman to certify quarterly staffing
and user fee spending for the FDA’s reporting to the Committee.
Valley Fever.—The Committee is encouraged by progress made
toward producing a Valley Fever vaccine and recommends that the
FDA consult with the public and obtain input on the state of the
science related to vaccines to prevent Valley Fever. The Committee
further recommends that the FDA draft and issue industry guid-
ance for entities seeking approval under the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or licensure under section
351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) of antifungal
therapies to treat Valley Fever.
Vibrio.—The Committee is aware of the public health challenge
related to the naturally occurring bacteria called Vibrio
parahaemolyticus that can accumulate in shellfish and believes
that more scientific research is necessary to develop proper controls
that will reduce the risk to consumers and sustain a healthy do-
mestic shellfish industry. The Committee encourages the FDA to
increase funding for research into Vibrio illnesses associated with
the consumption of raw molluscan shellfish, improve risk assess-
ment models, and develop improved rapid detection methods for
virulent Vibrio strains.
Women in Clinical Research.—Following recommendations by the
Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating
Women, the Committee urges the agency to issue final regulations
relating to the protection of human subjects, including parts 50 and
56 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, with the latest regula-
tions of the Department of Health and Human Services relating to
the inclusion of pregnant women as subjects in clinical research.
The agency should consider further guidance about ethical issues
to be considered and strategies for designing ethical studies, to in-
form the inclusion of pregnant women and lactating women in a
clinical trial and facilitate their participation.
Women’s Health.—The Committee recognizes that women’s
health includes conditions and diseases that differently, dispropor-
tionately and/or solely impact the health of women. The Committee
directs the FDA to prioritize professional expertise in women’s biol-
ogy and innovation to facilitate a timely in the approval process,
ensure clinical trial design is representative of disease impact in
the broader population, and accelerate bringing medical innova-
tions to women.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $5,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,000,000
The FDA maintains offices and staff in 49 States and in the Dis-
trict of Columbia and Puerto Rico, including field laboratories and
specialized facilities, as well as the National Center for Toxi-
cological Research complex. Repairs, modifications, improvements,
and construction to the FDA headquarters and field facilities must
163
be made to preserve the properties, ensure employee safety, meet
changing program requirements, and permit the agency to keep its
laboratory methods up to date.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $5,000,000 for
the FDA buildings and facilities.
This funding shall be used to upgrade the FDA’s facilities and
laboratories which are currently below public safety standards and
incapable of performing agency requirements. The Committee is
aware that several FDA-owned facilities need significant renova-
tions and repairs. The Committee understands that high-quality,
reliable buildings are a necessity to support the FDA’s mission-crit-
ical work.
INDEPENDENT AGENCY
FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $100,425,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 106,500,000
The Farm Credit Administration [FCA] is the independent agen-
cy in the executive branch of the Government responsible for the
examination and regulation of the banks, associations, and other
institutions of the Farm Credit System.
Activities of FCA include the planning and execution of examina-
tions of Farm Credit System institutions and the preparation of ex-
amination reports. FCA also promulgates regulations, establishes
standards, enforces rules and regulations, and approves certain ac-
tions of the institutions.
The administration and the institutions under its jurisdiction
now operate under authorities contained in the Farm Credit Act of
1971 (Public Law 92–181), effective December 10, 1971. Public Law
99–205, effective December 23, 1985, restructured FCA and gave
the agency regulatory authorities and enforcement powers.
The act provides for the farmer-owned cooperative system to
make sound, adequate, and constructive credit available to farmers
and ranchers and their cooperatives, rural residences, and associa-
tions and other entities upon which farming operations are depend-
ent, and to modernize existing farm credit law to meet current and
future rural credit needs.
The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–233) au-
thorized the formation of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Cor-
poration [FAMC] to operate a secondary market for agricultural
and rural housing mortgages. FCA, under section 8.11 of the Farm
Credit Act of 1971 (Public Law 92–181), as amended, is assigned
the responsibility of regulating this entity and assuring its safe and
sound operation.
Expenses of FCA are paid by assessments collected from the
Farm Credit System institutions and by assessments to the FAMC.

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.μ
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term ‘‘congression-
ally directed spending item’’ means a provision or report language
included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process. For each
item, a Member is required to provide a certification that neither
the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has a pecuniary
interest in such congressionally directed spending item. Such cer-
tifications are available to the public on the website of the Senate
Committee on Appropriations (https://www.appropriations.senate.
gov/congressionally-directed-spending-requests). Following is a list
of congressionally directed spending items included in the Senate
recommendation discussed in this report, along with the name of
each Senator who submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdic-
tion for each item so identified. Neither the Committee rec-
ommendation nor this report contains any limited tax benefits or
limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV.

OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF THE BILL
The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administra-
tion, and Related Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for
a wide array of Federal programs, mostly in the U.S. Department
of Agriculture [USDA]. These programs include agricultural re-
search, education, and extension activities; natural resources con-
servation programs; farm income and support programs; marketing
and inspection activities; domestic food assistance programs; rural
housing, economic and community development, and telecommuni-
cation and electrification assistance; and various export and inter-
national activities of the USDA.
The bill also provides funding for the Food and Drug Administra-
tion [FDA] and allows the use of collected fees for administrative
expenses of the Farm Credit Administration [FCA].
The discretionary programs and activities of USDA and FDA
that are supported by this bill include high priority responsibilities
entrusted to the Federal Government and its partners to protect
human health and safety, contribute to economic recovery, and
achieve policy objectives strongly supported by the American peo-
ple.
All accounts in the bill have been closely examined to ensure
that an appropriate level of funding is provided to carry out the
programs of USDA, FDA, and FCA. Details on each of the ac-
counts, the funding level, and the Committee’s justifications for the
funding levels are included in the report.
Fiscal year 2025 levels cited in this report reflect amounts en-
acted in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions
Act, 2025 (Public Law 119–4) and do not include fiscal year 2025
supplemental appropriations. Accordingly, any comparisons to fis-
cal year 2025 do not reflect fiscal year 2025 supplemental appro-
priations. Fiscal year 2025 supplemental appropriations are in-
cluded in the comparative statement of new budget authority at
the end of this report under the heading ‘‘Other Appropriations’’.
REPORTS TO CONGRESS
The Committee has, throughout this report, requested agencies
to provide studies and reports on various issues. The Committee
utilizes these reports to evaluate program performance and make
decisions on future appropriations. The Committee directs that all
studies and reports be provided to the Committee as electronic doc-
uments in an agreed upon format within 120 days after the date
of enactment of this act, unless an alternative submission schedule
is specifically stated in the report.

Agricultural Supply Chain Security.—The Committee recognizes
the threat adversaries pose to our nation’s agricultural and food
systems. The Committee encourages the Department to consider
ways to invest in the development of critical inputs, and secure
data domestically. Additionally, the Committee requests a briefing
on our current reliance on adversaries for inputs, such as but not
limited to amino acids, vitamins, fertilizers, and pesticides.
Biosecurity Workforce Readiness.—The Committee encourages
the Department of Agriculture to strengthen internal capacity re-
lated to biotechnology and biosecurity as they pertain to national
and economic security. The Committee supports the development of
core competencies for USDA personnel working on biotechnology
policy, including regular training on emerging technologies, labora-
tory methods, biosecurity protocols, and relevant data systems. The
Committee also encourages the Department to evaluate whether
key personnel involved in biotechnology and biosecurity decision-
making hold appropriate security clearances and have timely ac-
cess to relevant classified information.
Colonias and Farmworker Initiatives.—The Committee requests
an update on the Department’s effort to streamline and coordinate
existing Federal programs serving colonias and farmworkers, in-
cluding housing, healthcare, water infrastructure, and broadband
programs, and the consideration of establishing an ‘‘Office of
Colonias and Farmworker Initiatives’’.
Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] Obligations and Commit-
ments.—The Secretary is directed to notify the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House and Senate in writing 15 days prior to
any announcement on the use or cancellation of funds from the
CCC or the obligation, commitment, transfer, or cancellation of any
emergency funds from the CCC.
The Committee also reminds USDA that while the Secretary has
broad authority to utilize the CCC for emergencies such as the re-
cent outbreak of high pathogen avian influenza, creating programs
with CCC funds that then cannot be implemented without utilizing
the interchange authority, requiring additional appropriated dol-
lars, or that will take years to obligate funding is not an appro-
priate use. As such, the plan required to be submitted as part of
the CCC notification shall also include outyear costs for implemen-
tation and how the Department intends to operationalize the pro-
gram.
Communication from USDA.—A collaborative working relation-
ship between the Committee and USDA is necessary to ensure effi-
cient and effective implementation of Congress’ funding decisions.
USDA is directed to continue notifying the Committee of major
changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its
operations before providing non-governmental stakeholders such
information, before making the changes public, and before imple-
menting them.
Communications Services for Limited English Proficient Commu-
nities.—The Committee supports efforts to improve communica-
tions, which should include mediums such as television and radio,
to reach limited English proficient [LEP] communities. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to review its practices and cre-
ate uniform applications across all Department agencies to

8
strengthen communication practices to include digital, television,
and radio advertising when working with LEP communities. The
Department shall report to the Committee no later than 60 days
after the enactment of this act on planned expenditures in fiscal
year 2026 to reach LEP communities, including local media adver-
tising.
Cover Crops.—The Secretary, in consultation with the Risk Man-
agement Agency, shall submit a written report, within 1 year of en-
actment of this act, on how the Department can streamline oppor-
tunities for farmers to insure primary and secondary crops with
revenue streams resulting from biofuel use, with particular ref-
erence tocarinata, pennycress, camelina, and other oilseeds.
Disaster Assistance.—In December of 2024, the Committee pro-
vided more than $33.5 billion in supplemental disaster assistance
funds for our nation’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities to
assist with market and weather-related losses. The Committee
commends the Department for expeditiously initiating the Emer-
gency Commodity Assistance Program and releasing other funds
including those to assist with livestock losses. The Committee di-
rects the secretary to continue to prioritize the advancement and
dispersal of the remaining weather-related assistance and to keep
the Committee apprised of those efforts. This includes the directive
regarding technical assistance for interested non-insured producers
who wish to participate in the programs.
Federal Trust and Treaty Responsibilities.—The Committee re-
minds agencies funded by this act of their obligation to uphold the
Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes and Federal obli-
gations to the Native Hawaiian Community. This includes uphold-
ing treaty and reserved rights, and any other rights and obligations
under Federal law; supporting self-determination efforts by Native
communities; fulfilling obligations under Presidential Memoranda
and Executive Orders; and conducting early and robust govern-
ment-to-government consultation with Tribes, and meaningful out-
reach and engagement with Native Hawaiians. The Committee fur-
ther reminds agencies that the unique relationship between the
Federal Government and Tribes is based on the political status of
Tribes, and as such, agencies are directed to ensure that the imple-
mentation of Executive Order 14151 does not include American In-
dians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.
Funding Status Report.—Within 30 days of the enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations a written report that pro-
vides a list of each grant, cooperative agreement, and contract
award that was delayed, terminated, or otherwise withheld for
more than five days in calendar year 2025. The report shall include
a justification for delay, termination, or withholding for each grant,
contract, and cooperative agreement, the location of the project or
service, the amount of the award, the current status of the award,
and the source of funding.
Institute for Rural Partnerships.—The Committee recognized the
unique challenges faced by rural communities when it provided
funding in fiscal year 2025 to continue three Institutes for Rural
Partnerships in geographically diverse locations to identify and
support community, statewide and regional partnership to address

9
these challenges. As rural challenges evolve, the continued need for
these Institutes is clear. Therefore, the Committee provides
$6,000,000 to be divided equally to continue the Institute for Rural
Partnerships at established land-grant universities including the
Auburn University Partnership Institute at Auburn University, the
Wisconsin Rural Partnership Institute at the University of Wis-
consin-Madison, and the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships at
the University of Vermont, which were originally funded in fiscal
year 2022. Funding will support focused research and applied tran-
sitional needs locally and regionally.
Office of Tribal Relations.—The Committee supports elevating
the Office of Tribal Relations to an Assistant Secretary level and
encourages the Secretary to evaluate the resources needed.
Resource Conservation and Development Councils.—Since 1964,
the Resource Conservation and Development [RC&D] Councils
have worked at the grassroots level with local leaders to plan, de-
velop, and carry out programs for land and water conservation and
management. The Committee encourages the Secretary to consider
the maximum practical use of RC&D Councils, where such RC&D
Councils meet agency performance requirements, in the delivery of
USDA programs and services.
Rural News Media and Advertising Campaigns.—The Committee
recognizes the critical role local media plays in delivering messages
to small or rural communities. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to utilize local news media in rural areas for USDA adver-
tising campaigns to reach citizens in these communities with key
messages. Local media should include newspapers, including non-
daily newspapers, television, and radio. The Committee directs the
Office of the Secretary to update the Committee within 120 days
of enactment of this act on the efforts of the Department, including
the Agricultural Marketing Service, Rural Development, the Farm
Service Agency, and the Food and Nutrition Service, in utilization
of local media in rural areas as part of the Department’s adver-
tising campaigns for fiscal year 2026.
Seafood Industry Liaison.—The Committee provides $625,000 to
establish a position in the Office of the Secretary solely responsible
for the effective coordination of seafood policies and activities with-
in the Department, and in coordination with the Secretary of Com-
merce and the United States Trade Representative, relating to the
support of domestically harvested and processed wild and farmed
seafood.
Soil Carbon Monitoring.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment, in close collaboration with experts, to conduct a systematic
review of existing USDA and Federal Government soil carbon mon-
itoring methodologies, such as, methodologies that may have been
developed by the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network,
Long-Term Ecological Research Network, the National Ecological
Observatory Network, or other networks, in order to develop a
standardized soil carbon monitoring methodology that is reflective
of current best practices and ensures the scientific rigor necessary
to accurately measure and monitor soil carbon stocks and fluctua-
tions over time and across regions, soil types, and various produc-
tion systems. The Committee encourages the Department to utilize
the standardized methodology and large-scale data analysis and in-

10
sights developed from this review to inform Natural Resources
Conservation Service technical assistance to producers.
Tribal Self-Determination.—The Committee directs the Secretary
to submit a plan for expanding Tribal self-determination beyond
the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and Tribal
Forestry program pilots, including, where possible, through ex-
panding 638 contract authority.
Quarterly Reports.—The Committee is concerned with recent
changes in staffing levels and expects that the Secretary shall
maintain sufficient staffing across the Department to spend the
funds provided and to support the programs and missions outlined
in this act. The Committee also expects timely obligations of the
funds provided within this act. As such, The Committee directs the
Secretary to submit a unified quarterly report detailing staffing
levels and obligated balances across the Department. Staffing data
should provide detail by agency, including current levels and end
of year goals. Obligation data should include year-to-date obliga-
tions and current balances at the mission area, agency, and pro-
gram level. The obligation data shall also include a comparison of
the obligations incurred in the period covered by the update for
this fiscal year to the obligations incurred in the same period in the
previous two fiscal years.
EXECUTIVE OPERATIONS
Executive operations were established as a result of the reorga-
nization of the Department to provide a support team for USDA
policy officials and selected Department-wide services. Activities
under the executive operations include the Office of the Chief Econ-
omist, the National Appeals Division, and the Office of Budget and
Program Analysis.

Data Collection on Religiously Informed Diets.—The Committee
appreciates the Department’s efforts to improve access to kosher
and halal food for Americans with religiously informed diets. How-
ever, the Committee remains concerned about the gaps that still
exist between the need and the products currently available. While
studies to collect data in this area have been conducted in indi-
vidual States, there is a lack of data available at the National
level. The Committee encourages ERS to track and report on the
scope, scale and location of the needs of Americans with religiously
informed diets.
International Commodity Trade.—The Committee recognizes the
economic importance of international trade for U.S. agricultural
commodities and believes that producers and markets would ben-
efit from having access to additional data on the country of destina-
tion or origin of those commodities. The Committee appreciates
that ERS has begun work on the top five agricultural commodity
exports and imports by State and to identify the country of destina-
tion or origin of those commodities. The Committee directs ERS to
publish this data on a quarterly basis in language that is clear,
concise, well-organized, and user-friendly, avoiding unnecessary
complexity so that it is easier for members of the general public to
understand.
Midwest Center of Agricultural Policy.—The Committee encour-
ages the Secretary to continue standing up the new Midwest policy
center and continues providing support for the existing regional
centers.

ognizes the burgeoning natural turf industry and encourages NASS
to collect data on acreage, production, and economic impact, to in-
clude employment, input costs, and retail value, of turfgrass pro-
duction.
Reports.—The Committee encourages NASS to prioritize the con-
tinued publication of all periodically published reports. The Com-
mittee recognizes that producers rely on NASS reports to make
sound marketing and investment decisions in the agricultural mar-
ket. The reports are vital for market transparency and market an-
ticipation for the entire agricultural sector.
State-Specific and Regionally-Tailored Publications.—The Com-
mittee is concerned by the decision to discontinue publications tai-
lored specifically to individual States and regions, though it notes
that the State-level data will continue to be available in national
releases and the Quick Stats database. The Committee directs
NASS to brief the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this
act on how the agency will continue to make this information read-
ily available and accessible to producers and stakeholders.

increasing economic and food safety threat that aflatoxin poses to
corn and other affected agricultural crops and products. Aflatoxin
has historically been a regional concern in the southeast but is cur-
rently spreading to other parts of the country due to more frequent
extreme weather events. As such, the Committee provides an in-
crease of $250,000 for ARS to expand research into methods of
mitigating the risk of aflatoxin, particularly regarding responsive
agriculture, human nutrition, and food safety.
Agricultural Data Security.—The Committee recognizes the crit-
ical need for agricultural data security advancements alongside in-
creased use of autonomous systems and new technologies. To pre-
pare for these needs, the Committee provides no less than the fis-
cal year 2024 level for ARS to collaborate with a land-grand univer-
sity to research these data security needs and solutions. The part-
nership should involve a university with expertise in both agricul-
tural technology cybersecurity.

duction in the Southeastern United States. The Committee pro-
vides no less than the fiscal year 2024 level to continue this re-
search.
Wind Erosion Research Network.—The Committee provides no
less than the fiscal year 2024 level to develop infrastructure to pre-
dict wind erosion effects and target erosion mitigation measures in
response to fire and vegetation loss and a changing climate.

Activities.
Agricultural Research Enhancement Awards.—The Committee
remains determined to see that quality research and enhanced
human resources development in the agricultural and related
sciences be a nationwide commitment. Therefore, the Committee
continues its direction that not less than 15 percent of the competi-
tive research grant funds be used for USDA’s agricultural research

39
enhancement awards program, including USDA Established Pro-
gram to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCOR].
Agricultural Workforce Development.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of agriculture workforce training, education, re-
search and outreach activities. The Committee also notes the im-
portant role of junior or community colleges, who are eligible for
AFRI awards, in developing the next generation of our agricultural
workforce. Within the AFRI Education and Workforce Development
initiative, the Committee encourages the Secretary to give strong
consideration to applications from junior or community colleges, as
well as applications that establish or expand career and technical
opportunities in meat and poultry processing considering specific
gaps exist in this sector.
Agriculture and Food Research Initiative.—The Committee pro-
vides $445,200,000 for the Agriculture and Food Research Initia-
tive [AFRI].
Section 7406 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008
(Public Law 110–234) specifies priority areas within AFRI, includ-
ing an emphasis on conventional (classical) plant and animal
breeding. The Committee strongly supports providing farmers na-
tionwide with greater access to cultivars that are locally and re-
gionally adapted to their soils, climates, and farming systems. The
Committee directs the agency to make regionally adapted, publicly
held cultivar development a distinct funding priority within AFRI
for fiscal year 2026 and directs the agency to continue tracking
public cultivar projects within AFRI and report its progress in
meeting this goal.
Agroacoustics.—The Committee recognizes the growing field of
acoustics and the many positive impacts it may have in agriculture,
particularly with respect to pest management. The Committee en-
courages AFRI to prioritize funding for agroacoustics in its basic
and applied research program, as well as through the Food and Ag-
ricultural Science Enhancement Grants.
Alfalfa Seed and Alfalfa Forage Systems Research.—The Com-
mittee notes that research into alfalfa and forage has the potential
to increase alfalfa and forage yields, increase milk production, and
improve genetics. The Committee provides no less than fiscal year
2025 level to support research into the improvement of yields,
water conservation, creation of new uses, and other research areas
holding the potential to advance the alfalfa seed and alfalfa forage
industry.
Algae Research.—The Committee recognizes the opportunities for
innovation in food, fuel, animal feed, and aquaculture in algae re-
search and development. The Committee encourages NIFA to sup-
port research into algae-based initiatives.
Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes.—The Committee sup-
ports the collaboration between USDA and the National Science
Foundation to pursue advances in precision agriculture, food sys-
tem security, and forestry. The ability to meet the critical needs of
the future agricultural workforce, provide tools for resilient agri-
culture and food security are within the mission of the agency in
providing opportunity through innovation. The Committee encour-
ages NIFA to continue supporting the work of the Artificial Intel-
ligence Research Institutes funded through USDA at current fund-

40
ing levels and to begin planning a process for renewal opportuni-
ties.
Biomass for Carbon Dioxide Removal.—The Committee recog-
nizes the opportunities for novel approaches to use biomass in ways
that optimize carbon storage and encourages NIFA to support re-
search into these applications in a manner consistent with existing
food and fiber objectives.
Brucellosis Research.—Federal and State animal health officials
have made eradicating livestock disease with significant reservoirs
a national animal health priority. This need is reflected in the Ag-
riculture Act of 2014 which made the research and development of
surveillance methods, vaccines, vaccination delivery systems or
diagnostics tests a priority research area under the Competitive,
Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act particularly for bovine
brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis. The Committee recognizes the
need for this research and encourages the agency to make competi-
tive grants available to study improved management tools for
zoonotic livestock diseases with significant wildlife reservoirs.
Citrus Disease Research Program.—The Emergency Citrus Dis-
ease Research and Extension Program is intended to discover and
develop tools for early detection, control, and eradication of dis-
eases and pests that threaten domestic citrus production and proc-
essing. In the past, the program has received $25,000,000 per year
in mandatory funding through the Specialty Crop Research Initia-
tive. The Committee believes that research projects funded under
this authority should be prioritized based on the critical threat of
citrus greening and encourages NIFA, to the maximum extent
practicable, to follow the recommendations of the National Agricul-
tural Research, Extension, and Education Advisory Board’s citrus
disease subcommittee and to collaborate with the HLB MAC group.
The Committee encourages NIFA to engage with growers in areas
of emerging citrus production to provide extension services regard-
ing citrus greening.
Education Grants for Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serv-
ing Institutions.—The Committee continues to strongly support and
maintains funding for the Alaska Native-Serving and Native Ha-
waiian-Serving Institutions Education Program.
Enhanced Rock Weathering Research.—The Committee notes
that projects that focus on researching enhanced rock weathering
and related monitoring, reporting, and verification efforts are eligi-
ble for Agriculture and Food Research Initiative [AFRI] awards.
The Committee directs NIFA to prioritize funding for projects ad-
dressing carbon removal through enhanced rock weathering, in-
cluding on monitoring, reporting, and verification [MRV] of carbon
and non-climate agricultural benefits, among other priorities. NIFA
shall report to the Committee 180 days after enactment of this act
on grants awarded for such purposes in the previous fiscal year.
Enteric Methane Innovation.—The Committee recognizes the
value of public research in supporting innovation. The Committee
encourages AFRI to prioritize applications that focus on the ad-
vancement of enteric fermentation solutions, such as cattle feed ad-
ditives, methane-inhibiting vaccines, and breeding for low-methane
cattle, and direct-fed microorganisms.

41
Food Safety.—The Committee continues its recommendation that
NIFA prioritize research on technologies to rapidly and effectively
detect pathogens or contaminants in order to address foodborne ill-
nesses and improve the safety of our Nation’s food supply, includ-
ing research of novel biodetection technologies.
Forest Products.—The Committee recognizes the important role
of the forests products sector to the U.S. economy. The need to cre-
ate new and improved value-added products and renewable energy
from our Nation’s wood supply is critical to the sustainability of the
National economy. The Committee directs NIFA to support re-
search on wood quality improvement and improvement in forest
products evaluation standards and valuation techniques.
Genome to Phenome.—The Committee supports the Agricultural
Genome to Phenome Initiative to support the development of tools
and datasets for the analysis of phenotypes that can be used across
multiple livestock and crop species to improve the output and effi-
ciency of agriculture.
Intermediate Crops.—The Committee is aware of the nascent in-
dustry of ‘‘intermediate crops’’, such as winter camelina, field
pennycress, and carinata, that can be grown on existing farmland
between primary crops to produce feedstocks for renewable
biofuels. These intermediate crops offer similar soil health benefits
to cover crops and represent a new source of income for agricul-
tural producers. Within the funds provided for AFRI, the Com-
mittee encourages NIFA to prioritize funding for projects seeking
to advance the development, adoption, and processing for inter-
mediate crops, particularly under the Foundational and Applied
Science, Supplemental and Alternative Crop, and Sustainable Agri-
culture Systems program areas.
Laying Hen and Turkey Research Program.—The Committee
notes that research into laying hens and turkeys holds the poten-
tial to improve the efficiency and sustainability of laying hen and
turkey production through integrated, collaborative research and
technology transfer. The Committee continues to support research
into laying hen and turkey disease prevention, antimicrobial resist-
ance, nutrition, gut health, and alternative housing systems under
extreme weather conditions, all which hold the potential to advance
the laying hen and turkey industry.
Lowbush Blueberries.—The Committee directs NIFA to work
with research institutions to develop and refine predictive models
and monitoring technologies for native and invasive pests for incor-
poration into integrated pest management programs for naturally
seeded, native berry crops to increase the margin of food safety and
product quality.
Mental Health Support.—The Committee encourages NIFA to ex-
pand programs that deliver peer-to-peer mental health support to
individuals who are engaged in farming, ranching, farm work, and
other occupations relating to agriculture.
New Beginning for Tribal Students.—The Committee is con-
cerned that matching requirements often prevent Tribes, Tribal
Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Organizations from applying
for programs and grants at NIFA. The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to waive matching requirements for New Beginning for Trib-
al Students in NIFA in order to reduce the burden on Tribal Com-

42
munities and to increase Tribal participation in USDA programs
and grants.
Organic Research.—USDA’s National Organic Standards Board
[NOSB] has identified key organic research priorities, many of
which would help to address challenges that have limited the
growth in organic production in this country. The Committee en-
courages NIFA to give strong consideration to the NOSB organic
research priorities when crafting the fiscal year 2026 Request for
Applications for AFRI and the Organic Transition Program. Given
the growing demand for organic products, the Committee also en-
courages USDA to increase the number of organic research projects
funded under AFRI and the Specialty Crop Research Initiative.
Precision Management of Live Broiler Production.—The Com-
mittee encourages NIFA to support research focused on improving
animal welfare and health, food safety and food security through
novel broiler chicken live production approaches and methods that
drive transformational innovation in intelligent systems, automa-
tion, robotics, data science, and artificial technologies that could
enable greater efficiencies, better resilience, and viable poultry en-
terprises at various scales of production.
Potato Research.—To minimize the application of pesticides and
to maximize the yield and quality of harvested potatoes, the Com-
mittee directs the Secretary to support pest management programs
in potato growing States. Such programs help scientists track po-
tential pest outbreaks and provide growers and industry profes-
sionals with current information on specific and timely treatments.
Additionally, these programs help identify serious diseases, such as
late blight disease, in their early stages, allowing for preventive
measures to be put in place quickly to avoid crop losses.
Requests for Applications and Obligation of Awards.—The Com-
mittee is concerned by NIFA’s delays in issuing fiscal year 2025
Requests for Applications and subsequent grant awards. The Com-
mittee directs NIFA to report to the Committee within 30 days of
enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter on the expected
timeline of fiscal year 2026 Requests for Applications and award
announcements for each program.
Specialty Crop Research Initiative.—The Committee emphasizes
the important role of the Specialty Crop Research Initiative in ad-
dressing the critical needs of the specialty crop industry through
research and extension activities. The Committee encourages NIFA
to prioritize proposals for, and enhance its overall commitment to
the ability of farmers to extend their growing season through the
use of winter growing techniques, including but not limited to high
tunnel vegetable production. The Committee also encourages NIFA
to support research that would boost mechanization and automa-
tion of labor-intensive tasks in specialty crop production and proc-
essing.
Stray Voltage and Dairy Cattle Health.—The Committee is aware
of concerns from dairy producers and limited research regarding
the potential impact of stray voltage on animal health and milk
production. The Committee encourages NIFA to support research
into the prevalence, detection, and effects of stray voltage on dairy
cattle with the aim of improving diagnostic methods, assessing ani-

43
mal behavior and productivity, and evaluating mitigation strate-
gies.
Supplemental and Alternative Crops.—The Committee recognizes
the importance of nationally coordinated, regionally managed
canola research and extension programs. The Committee encour-
ages the Secretary to continue to seek input from stakeholders and
to give priority consideration to proposals in the peer review proc-
ess that address research needs in production areas with the great-
est potential to expand, as well as those where canola production
is established and needs to be maintained.
Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education [SARE].—The
Committee appreciates the work SARE has done to improve soil
health through cutting edge research, education, and extension on
cover crops, diversified rotations, and managed grazing. The Com-
mittee expects the funding provided to be focused on increasing ag-
ricultural resilience, including, where appropriate, interdisciplinary
systems research and education, farmer and rancher research and
demonstration grants, and graduate student research grants.
NATIVE AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS ENDOWMENT FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $11,880,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 11,880,000
The Native American Institutions Endowment Fund, authorized
by the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act (Public Law
103–382), provides an endowment for the 1994 land-grant institu-
tions (34 tribally-controlled colleges). This program enhances edu-
cational opportunity for Native Americans by building educational
capacity at these institutions in the areas of student recruitment
and retention, curricula development, faculty preparation, instruc-
tion delivery systems, and scientific instrumentation for teaching.
Income funds are also available for facility renovation, repair, con-
struction, and maintenance. On the termination of each fiscal year,
the Secretary shall withdraw the income from the endowment fund
for the fiscal year, and, after making adjustments for the cost of
administering the endowment fund, distribute the adjusted income
as follows: 60 percent of the adjusted income from these funds shall
be distributed among the 1994 land-grant institutions on a pro rata
basis, the proportionate share being based on the Indian student
count; and 40 percent of the adjusted income shall be distributed
in equal shares to the 1994 land-grant institutions.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $11,880,000 for
the Native American Institutions Endowment Fund.
EXTENSION ACTIVITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $561,700,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 561,700,000
Cooperative extension work was established by the Smith-Lever
Act of May 8, 1914, as amended (Public Law 63–95). USDA is au-
thorized to provide, through the land-grant colleges, cooperative ex-
tension work that consists of the development of practical applica-
tions of research knowledge and the giving of instruction and prac-

44
tical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or tech-
nologies in agriculture and related subjects, and to encourage the
application of such information by demonstrations, publications,
through 4–H clubs, and other means to persons not in attendance
or resident at the colleges.
To fulfill the requirements of the Smith-Lever Act (Public Law
63–95), State and county extension offices in each State, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American
Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and Micronesia conduct edu-
cational programs to improve American agriculture and strengthen
the Nation’s families and communities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Cooperative Extension System.—The Committee recognizes the
essential function that extension plays in ensuring that farmers,

45
ranchers, and communities of all sizes are empowered to meet the
challenges they face, adapt to changing technology and a changing
climate, improve nutrition and food safety, prepare for and respond
to emergencies, and protect our environment. The Committee is
concerned that the Federal investment in this critical Federal,
State, and local partnership has lagged in recent years, just as ex-
traordinary stresses have been placed on farmers, ranchers, rural
businesses, and communities.
Extension Design Initiative.—The Committee recognizes that for
decades, the foundation of traditional farm extension programs had
researchers and educators working on the farms and fields along-
side crop and livestock producers, but that changes are needed to
develop a 21st century extension to meet the needs of today’s farm-
ers. The Committee notes that new efforts require USDA to use
high-performance computing to develop, test, and deploy new dig-
ital infrastructure and platforms that can translate research into
real-time interactive feedback, online modeling, demonstration, and
simulations. The Committee directs NIFA to conduct meetings with
producers, stakeholders, and policymakers to begin developing a
framework for the next generation of farm extension programs.
Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network.—The Committee
recognizes the farmers, ranchers, and individuals working in agri-
culture who face highly stressful working conditions. NIFA is en-
couraged to coordinate with the Department of Health and Human
Services, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration to assess the feasibility of a national farmer
and farm worker crisis line. Within 180 days of enactment of this
act, NIFA is directed to provide a report detailing the program’s
evolution since inception, types of programming provided, and
FRSAN’s strategy for continuing outreach and services.
Minority Outreach.—The Committee is concerned that extension
service resources do not reach minority, socially disadvantaged,
and Tribal communities in proportion to their participation in the
agricultural sector. All institutions that receive extension funding
should seek to ensure that an equitable percentage of their overall
extension work reaches minority, socially disadvantaged, and Trib-
al communities. The Committee directs NIFA to evaluate distribu-
tion of extension resources to these three populations and report to
the Committee no later than 90 days after enactment of this act.
Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program [VMLRP].—The
Committee recognizes the importance of the VMLRP in meeting the
needs of rural ranchers, farmers, and rural communities across the
country by incentivizing licensed veterinarians to practice in
USDA-designated veterinary shortage areas. Within 90 days of en-
actment of this act and quarterly thereafter, NIFA is directed to
provide a report to the Committee on the number of declared short-
age areas, by State, and how many positions, by shortage area, re-
main unfilled.

Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative.—The Committee sup-
ports the important work being done through the publicly funded
diagnostic laboratory network and encourages NIFA to prioritize
funding to strengthen animal health diagnostic laboratories, taking
into consideration the following: the degree to which the capacity
for surveillance, monitoring, response, and capacity is enhanced;
the concentration of human and animal populations that are di-
rectly at risk; trade, tourism, and cultural considerations; geog-
raphy, ecology, and climate; evidence of active collaboration with
and support of the State animal health officials; those States with
highest risk for the introduction of foreign and emerging pests and
diseases; and evidence of stakeholder support and engagement.

ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,147,750,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,167,534,000
The Secretary of Agriculture established the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service on April 2, 1972, under the authority of
reorganization plan No. 2 of 1953, and other authorities. The major
objectives of APHIS are to protect the animal and plant resources
of the Nation from diseases and pests. These objectives are carried
out under the major areas of activity, as follows:
Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response.—The
agency monitors plant and animal health worldwide and sets im-
port polices to prevent the introduction of foreign plant and animal
pests and diseases. Domestically, the agency works cooperatively to
conduct plant and animal health monitoring programs, pursue
eradication, or limit the spread of the threat. The agency also con-
ducts diagnostic laboratory activities that support disease preven-
tion, detection, control, and eradication programs. In addition, the
agency protects agriculture from detrimental animal predators and
through its regulatory structure helps advance genetic research
while protecting against the release of harmful organisms.
Safe Trade and International Technical Assistance.—The agency
helps resolve technical trade issues to ensure the smooth and safe
movement of agricultural commodities into and out of the United
States. The agency negotiates animal and plant health certification
requirements and assists U.S. exporters in meeting foreign regu-
latory demands. In addition, the agency assists developing coun-
tries in improving their safeguarding systems to protect the United
States from emerging plant and animal pests and diseases.
Animal Care.—The agency conducts regulatory activities that en-
sure the humane care and treatment of animals and horses as re-
quired by the Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 89–544) and Horse
Protection Acts (Public Law 91–540). These activities include in-
spection of certain establishments that handle animals intended for
research, exhibition, and as pets, and monitoring certain horse
shows.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,167,534,000
for salaries and expenses of the Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service [APHIS], including $11,384,000 for Congressionally Di-
rected Spending.

Agricultural Quarantine Inspection.—The Committee recognizes
that the prevention of infestations of pests and diseases is signifi-
cantly more cost effective than subsequent control or eradication.
This is an important Federal responsibility, and the Committee
provides $35,500,000 for the agricultural quarantine inspections
[AQI] function, including pre-departure and interline inspections,
and canine detection and surveillance activities.
Animal Product Imports.—APHIS Animal Products Import and
Export division is responsible for keeping the U.S. safe from foreign
animal disease while also promoting trade through negotiating
science based health certificates and procedures with foreign gov-
ernments to enhance U.S. agriculture exports. The Committee
maintains funding consistent with fiscal year 2024 levels to support
the APHIS Animal Products Import and Export activities, includ-
ing sanitary and phytosanitary issues that arise between U.S. for-
eign governments and export destinations.
Animal Welfare.—The Committee is concerned about APHIS’
Animal Care program and the steep decline in enforcement related
to violations of the Animal Welfare Act urges the agency to reform
its current licensing and enforcement scheme. While the agency
has taken steps towards this goal, the Committee believes more
progress can be made. This includes, but is not limited to: ensuring
consistent, thorough, unannounced inspections on a regular basis;
ensuring each failure to allow access for inspection and each viola-
tion or failure to comply with animal welfare standards is docu-
mented on an inspection report; and, requiring that inspection re-
ports which identify violations or failures of compliance be shared
with relevant local, State, and Federal agencies.
The Committee continues to encourage APHIS to use its full en-
forcement capabilities under the AWA against chronic violators of
the AWA. The Committee directs the agency to update the Com-
mittee within 60 days of enactment of the act on AWA enforcement
activities, including the number of cases referred to the Office of
the General Counsel, the Department of Justice, or both, when ap-
propriate. The Secretary of Agriculture shall continue the March
2024 memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Attorney Gen-
eral to encourage greater collaboration on Animal Welfare Act en-
forcement and ensure that the Department of Justice has access to
evidence needed to initiate cases.

50
In July 2023, USDA announced an independent review of the
Animal Care program by a third-party entity. The Committee urges
the Secretary to ensure that next phase of the review—stakeholder
analysis—includes input from Congress and expert animal protec-
tion organizations, and that APHIS continues to strengthen its
AWA enforcement efforts while this review is underway.
Chronic Wasting Disease [CWD].—The Committee is concerned
about the growing threat of CWD and its impact on wild and
farmed deer populations. As such, the Committee provides APHIS
$22,500,000 for CWD related activities. Specifically, of the amount
provided for cervid health activities, $12,500,000 shall be for
APHIS to allocate funds directly to State departments of wildlife,
State departments of agriculture, Native American Tribes, and re-
search institutions and universities to further develop and imple-
ment CWD surveillance, testing, management, and response activi-
ties, and $5,000,000 shall be for indemnity payments and associ-
ated costs to remove infected and exposed animals as expeditiously
as possible. Of the amount provided for Wildlife Service Methods
Development, $5,000,000 shall be for CWD work at the National
Wildlife Research Center, and the Committee directs APHIS to con-
tinue working with university collaborators to provide research
support to the overall effort to detect, combat, and control CWD.
Cogongrass Management and Control.—The Committee main-
tains the fiscal year 2025 level to assist States with cogongrass
management and control efforts.
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under APHIS.
While the Committee has provided the funding, recipients of CDS
are still required to apply for the funding. The Committee expects
the agency to review the applications and fund projects in the same
manner as in previous years.
Contingency Fund..—The term ‘contingency fund’ as referenced
in the APHIS table shall be defined as a source of funding avail-
able for the control of outbreaks of insects, plant diseases, animal
diseases and for control of pest animals and birds.
Crop Threat Assessment.—The Committee directs APHIS to de-
liver a report that assesses the threats to crops on the U.S. main-
land from agricultural pests and diseases from Central and South
America and the Asia Pacific region within 180 days of enactment
of this act. The report should include an identification of how pests
from these regions usually reach the U.S. mainland, and a descrip-
tion of how the Department prevents the introduction of new pests
from these regions.
Electronic Identification Tags.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the electronic identification tags for certain cattle
and bison moving across state lines for disease traceability. The
Committee includes $13,500,000 for APHIS to procure and dis-
tribute the requisite number of tags associated with the implemen-
tation of this rule, including brucellosis EID tags for States in and
surrounding the Greater Yellowstone Area. APHIS is directed to
provide the Committee an update on the use of these funds within
90 days of enactment of this act and quarterly thereafter.
Equine Health Activities.—The Committee provides $2,450,000
for equine health activities, of which $250,000 shall be used to sup-

51
port ongoing cooperative agreements with States impacted by East-
ern Equine Encephalitis that received funding in fiscal year 2024.
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza [HPAI].—The Committee re-
mains concerned with the spread of highly pathogenic avian influ-
enza and appreciates the Department’s ongoing efforts to contain
spread of the virus. The Committee encourages the Department to
continue coordination with State animal health officials in order to
proactively mitigate spread of the virus. The Committee also urges
the Department to increase outreach and engagement with poultry
producers to educate on proactive measures individuals can take to
further mitigate the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
Additionally, the Committee recognizes the extreme economic
hardship posed to gamebird and egg farmers when flocks are deter-
mined to be infected by high and low pathogenic avian influenza
and acknowledges the severe limitations on controlled marketing
available to producers of live game birds, as well as the income loss
from egg production. The Committee encourages APHIS to provide
full indemnity coverage for gamebird and egg operations and cease
attempts to limit coverage. The Committee directs the Secretary to
provide a report within 90 days of enactment of this act regarding
the economic impact of avian influenza on the whole gamebird sup-
ply chain, including small businesses and preserve customers, and
proposals for insurance or indemnity options for the impacted busi-
nesses and preserves.
While the Committee agrees that the transfer of CCC funds to
APHIS to address HPAI was warranted to continue to address the
ongoing outbreak among poultry and the transmission to dairy cat-
tle, to ensure that these funds are used effectively, APHIS is di-
rected to brief the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this
act and monthly thereafter on the use of these funds. This brief
shall include both budgetary and operational data on APHIS’ ef-
forts to address HPAI in both dairy cattle and poultry, com-
plemented with a monthly HPAI obligation report, progress update
on APHIS’ 5-pronged strategy to combat HPAI, as well as how
APHIS is working with other Federal partners such as the Centers
for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration, and
State and local entities.
Horse Protection.—The Committee provides no less than the fis-
cal year 2024 level for enforcement of the Horse Protection Act of
1970, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1831), and reminds the Secretary that
Congress granted the agency primary responsibility to enforce this
law, including the training of all inspectors. The Committee directs
APHIS to ensure that all official warning letters, administrative
complaints, stipulations, and consent decisions are made publicly
available in a searchable format, consistent with 7 U.S.C. 2146a.
Inspection of Research Facilities.—The Committee is aware that
Veterinary Medical Officers [VMOs] and Improved Training for In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committees [IACUC] members
play a significant role in the administration of animal protection
programs at research facilities. Therefore, proper training of such
personnel is essential. The Committee directs APHIS to provide on-
demand, publicly available training for IACUC members and
VMOs on how to perform adequate inspections of research facili-
ties. The training should inform VMOs and IACUC members, as

52
relevant to their respective roles in providing oversight of research
facilities, how to review, monitor, and approve research facilities’
protocols; verify the accuracy of annual reports submitted by re-
search facilities to confirm the correct number of animals used in
every experiment and that animals are reported in the correct pain
category; and review and monitor experiments performed on ani-
mals by research facilities to ensure the humane care and use of
animals in compliance with the AWA and IACUC-approved proto-
cols.
APHIS shall report to the Committee on an annual basis about
the trainings it has offered to VMOs and IACUC members on how
to perform adequate research facility inspections. In addition, all
training materials used and distributed by APHIS should be pub-
licly accessible online.
Lacey Act Implementation.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3371–3378) in addressing traf-
ficking of illegally taken wildlife, fish, and plants, including illegal
deforestation activities. The Committee provides no less than the
fiscal year 2024 level to support the implementation of the Lacey
Act within the Safe Trade and International Technical Assistance
program. APHIS is directed to submit a report within 180 days of
enactment of this act outlining potential ways to address all out-
standing plant and wood product categories covered by the 2008
Amendment to the Lacey Act.
Los Alamitos Sterile Insect Release Facility.—The Committee
urges APHIS and local and State cooperators to develop a com-
prehensive plan for much needed facility enhancements at the Ster-
ile Insect Release Facility in Los Alamitos, California.
Marine Mammals in Captivity.—The Committee is concerned
that USDA’s handling, care, treatment, and transportation stand-
ards for marine mammals in captivity are outdated. Marine mam-
mal science has progressed significantly in the almost 40 years
since the most important of these regulations were last updated,
and the current standards do not adequately protect the welfare of
captive marine mammals. The Committee directs APHIS to
prioritize the development and finalization of a humane and
science-based rule to modernize its marine mammal regulations
and directs the agency to report back within 90 days of enactment
of this Act on its progress in achieving that goal.
National Animal Health Laboratory Network.—The Committee
provides no less than the fiscal year 2024 level for the National
Animal Health Laboratory Network.
National Aquatic Animal Health Plan.—The Committee provides
no less than the fiscal year 2025 level to support the continued im-
plementation of the 2025–2027 National Aquaculture Health Plan
and the Comprehensive Aquaculture Health Program Standards.
National Bio- and Agro-Defense Human Capital Development.—
The Committee provides $3,000,000 for APHIS to ensure necessary
steps are taken to develop a qualified workforce comprised of sub-
ject matter experts in foreign, emerging, and zoonotic diseases and
capable of developing, validating, and conducting needed
diagnostics, performing epidemiologic studies, and completing
bioinformatics analyses. The Committee encourages APHIS to es-
tablish cooperative agreements with academic research institu-

53
tions, particularly non-land grant Hispanic-Serving Institutions, to
support the next generation of the NBAF workforce, including fa-
cilities and equipment.
National Detector Dog Training Center.—The Committee sup-
ports the work of the National Detector Dog Training Center in
protecting the domestic agriculture sector from invasive pests and
diseases. The Committee requests USDA, within 1 year after enact-
ment of this act, to submit a report to Congress regarding the Cen-
ter’s role in protecting the domestic agriculture sector from pests
and diseases. The Committee requests that the report include a de-
scription of domestic pest and disease programs that use canine de-
tector teams, coordination between APHIS and U.S. Customs and
Border Protection on use of canine teams for agricultural quar-
antine inspections, and the Center’s current capacity level.
Additionally, the Committee encourages USDA Animal Plant
Health Inspection Service to consider and prioritize the growing
use of canine teams nationally and within territories of the U.S. by
exploring ways to expand the number of canine detection training
facilities across the country, to include areas on the West Coast
with high detection needs.
National Clean Plant Network.—APHIS is directed to allocate no
less than fiscal year 2025 levels to the National Clean Plant Net-
work.
National Veterinary Stockpile.—The Committee provides
$6,250,000 for the National Veterinary Stockpile to protect the Na-
tion’s food supply by maintaining enough countermeasures capable
of deployment against the most damaging animal diseases. The
Committee urges USDA to continue to stock and make available
U.S-manufactured reusable respirators in the National Veterinary
Stockpile [NVS]. Doing so is critical to support the availability of
tools that can protect Federal and State emergency responders. Re-
usable respirators provide enhanced protection and have a longer
shelf-life compared to disposable masks like N95s. Stockpiled ac-
cess to reusable respirators during a crisis can pre-empt shortages
that result from high demand or supply chain disruptions. The
Committee emphasizes the critical need to protect all Federal and
State animal disease emergency responders from infectious agents.
Navel Orangeworm.—The Committee recognizes the challenges
the navel orangeworm poses to tree nut production and provides no
less than fiscal year 2024 levels to continue managing the pest. Ad-
ditionally, the Committee encourages APHIS to partner with com-
modity organizations or private companies to combat navel
orangeworm by developing alternatives to traditional irradiation
sterile insect technique, including genetic engineering.
New World Screwworm.—The Committee is concerned by the
rapidly growing New World Screwworm [NWS] infestation in Mex-
ico and Central America, which threatens to infect our domestic
livestock industry. The Committee recognizes that past efforts to
eradicate this parasite in the United States were very costly, and
if an infestation were to occur within our borders today the burden
on taxpayers and private industry to eradicate would be far costlier
still. The Committee supports efforts by the Department to provide
the sterile insects necessary to prevent and control NWS and en-
courages the Department to construct a new sterile fly facility in

54
the United States to provide the sterile insects necessary to pre-
vent and control NWS.
Nitrogen-Based Deopopulation Methods.—The Committee directs
the USDA to continue to utilize available funds through the Na-
tional Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program to fa-
cilitate and invest in research and development of large-scale de-
population technologies, including whole house gassing with nitro-
gen and high expansion nitrogen gas-filled foam as methods of
large-scale depopulation during animal disease emergency response
events. Further, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide a
report to the Committee within 90 days on inclusion of the method
in the American Veterinarian Medical Association [AVMA] Depopu-
lation Guidelines and on the barriers to widespread use of nitro-
gen-based depopulation methods during animal disease emergency
response events.
Non-Lethal Strategies.—The Committee is aware that Wildlife
Services has worked with landowners to deploy non-lethal strate-
gies, such as fladry, electric fencing, and livestock guardian dogs,
to reduce predator depredation on livestock. The Committee pro-
vides $5,000,000 for Wildlife Services to hire personnel exclusively
to promote and implement non-lethal human-predator conflict de-
terrence techniques in interested States, with a focus on reducing
human-wildlife conflicts related to predators and beavers in the
Western Region and Great Lakes States and to assist in providing
training in these techniques to agricultural producers, landowners,
and other agency personnel in collaboration with the National
Wildlife Research Center.
Additionally, APHIS is directed to provide an annual report with-
in 120 days of the end of the fiscal year, detailing how these addi-
tional funds were dispersed; including regional distribution, wild
and domestic species impacted, number and size of livestock/agri-
cultural operations impacted, and nonlethal tools and methods im-
plemented and supported.
Online Dog Dealers.—The Committee is concerned about the lack
of enforcement of the law with respect to online dog dealers and
other types of pet dealers, which has allowed many online oper-
ations to continue selling puppies without the necessary USDA li-
censing under the Animal Welfare Act. The Secretary is directed to
prioritize the enforcement of the 2013 rule that requires that deal-
ers who APHIS has determined to be selling animals sight-unseen
to consumers must have the necessary license to do so.
Paraguayan Beef.—The Committee is concerned with the poten-
tial reintroduction of FMD and the devastation that would cause
our domestic cattle producers. Within 30 days of enactment of this
act, APHIS shall perform an updated risk analysis to determine
the safety of fresh (chilled or frozen) beef imports from Paraguay.
As part of this analysis, APHIS shall conduct at least one addi-
tional site visit to Paraguay to verify the data collected. In addi-
tion, the Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a working group:
(1) to evaluate the threat posed by beef and beef products imported
from Paraguay to food safety and animal health in the United
States; (2) to report on the most recent disease data and conduct
additional research on the threat to food safety and animal health;
and (3) to make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to

55
whether the importation of beef and beef products from Paraguay
into the United States should be permitted. The Secretary shall en-
sure that the working group includes: (1) experts on food safety; (2)
experts on animal health; and (3) representatives of U.S. Customs
and Border Protection and other Federal agencies with responsibil-
ities relating to international trade.
Pathogen Transmission Reduction for Agricultural Producers.—
The Committee is concerned about the current and potential future
impacts of H5N1 influenza and other biological threats to agri-
culture, and the needs of producers in protecting livestock from
these threats. The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture,
in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices, the Environmental Protection Agency, and agricultural pro-
ducers, to conduct an assessment of pathogen transmission reduc-
tion needs in farm facilities that house and process livestock to pro-
tect animals and humans from the spread of zoonotic diseases.
These structures include, but are not limited to poultry barns,
dairy barns and milking parlors, and swine barns. The assessment
should determine minimum air quality standards for reducing
pathogen transmission among livestock and agricultural workers.
The assessment should also identify and detail the methods for en-
hancing indoor air quality in these facilities and associated costs.
The Secretary shall fund this assessment using borrowing author-
ity from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Secretary shall
submit this assessment to Congress no later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act, and make the assessment publicly accessible
digitally, such as on a website or online portal.
Poultry Indemnity Payments.—The Committee directs USDA to
coordinate amongst all relevant agencies under its authority to up-
date, and where applicable, develop consistent, easily replicated
formulas on an annual basis to estimate market values of livestock
and poultry categories for indemnity purposes. In developing and
updating these annual values, USDA should ensure that they re-
flect applicable modern production practices, and relevant livestock
and poultry markets so that payments by USDA represent average
fair market values for the category of animal that the compensa-
tion payment is intended to cover.
Rangeland Grasshopper and Mormon Cricket Program.—The
Committee recognizes the importance of APHIS’ Rangeland Grass-
hopper and Mormon Cricket Program and includes an increase of
$500,000 to administer this program. APHIS is encouraged to ad-
minister these funds based on need and infestation severity rather
than on a first-come, first-serve basis due the season variation of
grasshopper infestations across the West.
Roseau Cane.—The Committee remains concerned with the
invasive species scale insect pest that is destroying Roseau cane in
the Mississippi River’s Delta region along the Gulf of Mexico. An
estimated 225,000 acres of wetlands in the Delta have been af-
fected with the die-off, and Roseau cane is important in maintain-
ing a healthy marsh and preventing erosion. The Committee di-
rects APHIS to work with ARS and stakeholders and provides no
less than the fiscal year 2025 level to develop an integrated man-
agement program for control of the Roseau cane scale insect pest
infestation.

56
Rotary Fleet.—The Committee recognizes the increasing demands
on the aging APHIS Wildlife Services rotary aircraft fleet to assist
the agricultural and livestock sectors. The Committee directs
APHIS to submit a report assessing the fleet’s current status and
future rotary aircraft needs to operate efficiently and effectively to
the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate no
later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this act.
Soring.—The Committee has consistently recognized the need for
the equine industry and APHIS to cooperate in order to eliminate
the soring of horses. In 2021, the National Academy of Sciences
[NAS] recognized the importance of continuing to develop an objec-
tive science-based inspection to ensure accuracy and fairness. The
Committee directs APHIS to continue swabbing and other proven
objective science-based inspection techniques for its horse soring in-
spection protocol and to address remaining findings of the NAS re-
port as the agency deems warranted.
Sudden Oak Death.—The European strain 1 [EU1] and the
North American strain 1 [NA1] of the sudden oak death pathogen
are major threats to western Douglas-fir/tanoak forests, resulting
in quarantine restrictions that threaten U.S. forests and export
markets for log shipments and lily bulbs. The Committee rec-
ommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2024 funding
level to improve understanding of EU1 and NA1 strains of the sud-
den oak death pathogen and treatment methods to inform control
and management techniques in wildlands.
Twenty-Eight Hour Law.—The Committee is concerned that the
regular feeding, watering, and rest required, by 49 U.S.C. 80502,
to be provided by animal carriers is not being effectively enforced.
The Committee still awaits the report on barriers to successful im-
plementation of this law.
Wildlife Damage Management.—APHIS is responsible for pro-
viding Federal leadership in managing problems caused by wildlife.
The Committee provides $123,500,000 for wildlife damage control
to maintain priority initiatives, including preventing the transport
of invasive snakes and other harmful species. The Committee pro-
vides $500,000 for the agency to reduce blackbird depredation in
the Northern Great Plains.
The Committee maintains support for assistance to catfish pro-
ducers to help mitigate wildlife depredation, particularly as it per-
tains to fish-eating and disease-carrying birds. The Committee pro-
vides no less than the fiscal year 2025 level for damage manage-
ment efforts and the development of methods to assist producers in
combatting the persistent threat and economic hardship caused by
cormorants, pelicans, and other birds.
The Committee recognizes the importance of the National Feral
Swine Damage Management Program in reducing adverse ecologi-
cal and economic impacts caused by feral swine across the country
and encourages the use of all approved measures as a force multi-
plier and to prioritize areas with the most populous swine popu-
lation.
The Committee directs APHIS to provide within 90 days of en-
actment of this act, and annually thereafter, a report to include the
state, most utilized methods, and most common reasons for lethal

57
removal of beavers on private and Federal land by the APHIS and
its partners.
The Committee provides $29,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000,
for the National Rabies Management Program to fortify existing
barriers and advance prevention and eradication efforts.
Wildlife Services Cost Share.—The Committee is concerned about
the increasing inequitable Federal amount of cost share in coopera-
tive service agreements between APHIS–Wildlife Services and/or
political subdivisions of States responsible for Wildlife Service pro-
grams that protect agriculture, property, human life, and natural
resources. The Committee expects Wildlife Services to strive for an
equitable 50/50 cost share to the extent that funding is available
to do so.
Wildlife Services Education and Training.—The Committee is
aware of the wide range of hazardous procedures and materials uti-
lized by APHIS personnel in the conduct of daily duties. In addi-
tion, a recent comprehensive study noted the critical need to pro-
vide standardized safety training, certification, and database man-
agement for tracking to ensure the safest working environment
possible. As such, the Committee provides $2,000,000 within Wild-
life Damage Management to maintain a National Training Acad-
emy focused on those areas of greatest concern such as pyrotech-
nics, firearms, hazardous materials, immobilization and euthanasia
drugs, pesticides, animal care and handling, land vehicles,
watercraft, and zoonotic diseases.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,000,000
The APHIS appropriation for Buildings and Facilities funds
major nonrecurring construction projects in support of specific pro-
gram activities and recurring construction, alterations, preventive
maintenance, and repairs of existing APHIS facilities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommendation includes an appropriation of
$1,000,000 for buildings and facilities of the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
This funding is necessary to allow APHIS to maintain existing
facilities and perform critically needed repairs to and replacements
of building components, such as heating, ventilation, and air-condi-
tioning on a prioritized basis at APHIS facilities. The Committee
notes that due to the environmentally sensitive nature of many
APHIS facilities, closure of a facility could result if APHIS is un-
able to complete the required repairs.
AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SERVICE
MARKETING SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $222,887,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 222,887,000
The Agricultural Marketing Service was established by the Sec-
retary of Agriculture on April 2, 1972. AMS carries out programs

58
authorized by more than 50 different statutory authorities, the pri-
mary ones being the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C.
1621–1627, 1635–1638); the U.S. Cotton Standards Act (7 U.S.C.
51–65); the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act (7 U.S.C. 471–476);
the Tobacco Inspection Act (7 U.S.C. 511–511q); the Perishable Ag-
ricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499a–499t); the Egg Products
Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031–1056); and section 32 of the act of
1935 (Public Law 74–320, 7 U.S.C. 612c).
Programs administered by this agency include the market news
services, standardization, grading, classing, shell egg surveillance
services, transportation services, wholesale farmers and alternative
market development, grant payments to States for marketing ac-
tivities, the Federal administration of marketing agreements and
orders, commodity purchases, the Perishable Agricultural Commod-
ities Act (7 U.S.C. 499a–499t), the Plant Variety Protection Act
(Public Law 71–325), and market protection and promotion activi-
ties.

Cattle Contract Library.—Smaller cattle producers often find
themselves to be price takers in the market for fed cattle and lack
the volume of large producers to negotiate unique and advan-
tageous marketing agreements with large meatpackers. The Cattle
Contracts Library helps bring transparency into the marketplace.

59
Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives.—The Committee is con-
cerned about the uptake of existing resources directed to dairy
farmers for the purpose of mitigating the spread of highly patho-
genic avian influenza in dairy cows. The Committee urges AMS to
direct Commodity Credit Corporation investments into innovative
and existing dairy programs that capture both dairy farmers and
dairy processors through the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives.
Dairy Sanitary Export Certificate Software.—The Committee is
concerned with the USDA dairy sanitary export certificate program
software ATLAS has caused US dairy exporters significant export
delays and detentions in foreign ports. USDA is directed to report
to the Committee on the status of its improvements to the ATLAS
program including reporting on the quantity errors in certificates
issued by the end of this fiscal year and to include in such report,
status of Department and AMS funding from existing and relevant
funds, such as CCC funds, and if necessary, inclusion within the
Department’s fiscal year 2027 budget request.
Domestic Shrimp.—The Committee is concerned that the domes-
tic shrimp fishing and processing industry is on the brink of col-
lapse due to the overproduction and oversupply of imported shrimp
to the U.S and global markets at unprecedented levels. The Com-
mittee recognizes that this surplus of imported shrimp in U.S. in-
ventory has driven prices offered to U.S. shrimp fishermen to his-
torically low levels that fall below that which can sustain shrimp
fishing operations. The Committee is also aware that a substantial
portion of the U.S. shrimp fishing fleet remains tied to the dock
and many small, family-owned shrimp businesses are going out of
business. To help reduce this unprecedented surplus of shrimp in
the U.S. market, the Committee encourages AMS to maximize its
section 32 program purchases of domestic warm-water shrimp.
Dry Edible Beans.—The Committee is aware that dry edible
beans are an important part of a nutritious and well-balanced diet.
However, the Committee is concerned that dry edible beans have
not played an adequate role in addressing nutrition needs under
U.S. international food aid programs as well as domestic feeding
programs and encourages the Department to enhance the amount
and frequency of dry edible bean purchases for use in such pro-
grams.
Equivalency Agreements.—The Committee is concerned that
there have been imports of critical foods, including infant formula,
that do not meet equivalency agreements made with other coun-
tries. Within 90 days of the enactment of this act, the Committee
directs AMS to provide a report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions in the House and Senate that touches on changes to all exist-
ing Equivalency Agreements that would need to be made in order
to be in compliance with the 2022 Origin of Livestock Rule. The
Committee also directs AMS to provide a list within the report to
the Committees of infant formula products that do not meet the
2022 Origin of Livestock Rule. To ensure that the industry is com-
pliant with the 2022 Origin of Livestock Rule, AMS is directed to
post the report publicly within 30 days of transmitting the report
to the Committees and is also directed to provide copies of the re-
port to the Food and Drug Administration and the Customs and
Border Protection.

60
Honey.—The Committee directs the department to provide a re-
port on the necessary resources and authorities needed to ensure
a fairer market for domestic honey producers and more transparent
market for American consumers. The Department is encouraged to
collaborate with Customs and Border Protection, the Food and
Drug Administration, and domestic commercial honey producer
stakeholders.
Local Agriculture Market Program.—The Committee continues to
urge the Department to simplify the application and reporting
process for the Local Agriculture Market Program. The Committee
is aware AMS implemented a turnkey grant application in fiscal
year 2023 for Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Grants
but that applications were restricted to specific project types, and
the list was not inclusive of common needs in direct marketing and
intermediary local market settings. The Committee encourages the
agency to expand the turnkey application to include other common
activities, including vendor and customer outreach activities, farm-
ers market manager staff time, regional food chain coordination,
and special purpose equipment.
Local Meat Processing.—The Committee recognizes and supports
investments in local meat processing. These investments are an op-
portunity to combat agricultural market concentration and increase
market access for American farmers and ranchers. The Committee
directs the Department to submit a report to the Committee within
90 days of enactment of this act that includes the total amount of
Federal investments made in local meat processing across depart-
mental programs, the current status of plants receiving funding,
whether the Department has reviewed any potential sales of plants
receiving funding, and, to the extent practicable, an assessment of
the economic impact of departmental programs on local meat proc-
essing.
Local Food Procurement.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of strengthening local and regional food systems to enhance
food security, support producers, and stimulate rural economies.
The Committee directs the Department to work in coordination
with State agencies, Tribal governments, local educational authori-
ties, and emergency food providers, including food banks and pan-
tries, to facilitate the use of Federal nutrition and food assistance
funds-including but not limited to funds under the Child Nutrition
Programs, The Emergency Food Assistance Program [TEFAP] (in-
cluding TEFAP Fresh Produce Box Program), Food Distribution
Program on Indian Reservations [FDPIR] and the Commodity Sup-
plemental Food Program [CSFP]—for the direct purchase of food
from small and mid-sized local and regional producers. The Com-
mittee also directs the Department of Defense Logistics Agency,
USDA Agricultural Marketing Service [AMS] and Food and Nutri-
tion Service to review current practices to identify opportunities to
increase local food purchases in the DoD Fresh and the Fresh Fruit
and Vegetable Program. The committee encourages the Depart-
ment to use best value evaluation criteria, other flexibilities within
the Federal Acquisition Regulations [FAR] including local set-
asides, to add language to the AMS agency supplement to the FAR
prioritizing local purchasing, and to streamline administrative re-
quirements to ensure highest quality food purchases and opportuni-

61
ties for local and regional procurement. USDA should collaborate
with State agencies (and their associations) to share local pur-
chasing best practices and to ensure that institutions and providers
can easily identify and procure from local producers. The Com-
mittee further directs USDA (Economic Research Service in co-
operation with the Office of Contracts and Procurement, Agricul-
tural Marketing Service and Food and Nutrition Service) to report
within 180 days of enactment of this act on barriers to local pro-
curement, pathways to overcome the barriers, and recommenda-
tions to enhance access to and affordability of locally grown foods
across nutrition assistance programs.
Meat Pricing Concerns.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of ensuring that meat pricing mechanisms are transparent
and provide reliable price discovery for cattle producers and the
rest of the supply chain nationwide. The Committee notes that the
Nation’s food supply chain is an issue of national security, and em-
phasizes that our farmers, ranchers, processors, and consumers
must have a fair and competitive marketplace. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary, to analyze these issues including economic dis-
ruptions associated with public health emergencies.
Micro-Grants for Food Security.—The Committee urges AMS to
administer the Micro-Grants for Food Security program in a man-
ner that will ensure that low-income, disadvantaged, and minority
individuals are able to submit applications and receive funding for
projects such as animal processing and slaughter facilities, includ-
ing reindeer herders, greenhouses, and hydroponic growing facili-
ties that would increase the amount and quality of locally produced
foods. When practicable, the Committee directs AMS to waive or
amend how it applies the regulatory requirements of 2 CFR
200.206, 200.313, 200.328, and 200.329 to ensure that this program
addresses food insecurity challenges.
National Organic Program.—The Committee recognizes that or-
ganic regulations are a valuable market development tool for U.S.
agriculture and provides no less than the fiscal year 2025 level for
the National Organic Program [NOP]. A healthy market for organic
products requires a clear product distinction backed by a trusted,
verified, and consistently enforced label. The Committee also recog-
nizes that regular updates to the regulations are crucial. The Com-
mittee directs USDA to provide all resources needed for the NOP
to deliver the strongest possible oversight before allowing the
USDA organic seal to be granted to domestic and international op-
erations and products, including a continued focus on proactive
risk-based investigations and oversight, enhanced training for cer-
tifiers, and practice standards development. In addition, within 60
days of enactment of this act, AMS is directed to provide a full re-
port outlining the breakdown of the National Organic Program’s
key expenditures such as compliance and enforcement activities,
practice standards development, and technology upgrades.
Native American Foods and Tourism.—The Committee recog-
nizes that enhanced Native American tourism creates important
job opportunities in Native American communities while show-
casing their heritage, food, traditions, history, and continuing vital-
ity. The Committee encourages USDA to support the Native Amer-
ican Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience Act (Public Law

62
114–221) by prioritizing projects that market, promote, or expand
Native American foods, markets, and enterprises.
Organic Dairy.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
consumer confidence in the integrity of the USDA Organic Seal and
notes the work that USDA has done to increase training and cer-
tifier consistency with respect to dairy operations. The Committee
directs AMS to seek strong enforcement of organic dairy production
standards and resolve significant variations in standard interpreta-
tion that exists among organic certifiers, as well as among organic
dairy producers. AMS shall continue to conduct critical risk-based
oversight, particularly for large, complex dairy operations, as it has
in the past four fiscal years.
Organic Data Initiative.—The Committee recognizes that accu-
rate data for the production, pricing, and marketing of organic
products is essential to maintaining stable markets, identifying
fraud, creating risk management tools, tracking production trends,
and increasing exports. Therefore, the Committee directs the Sec-
retary to require mandatory reporting on an annual basis by ac-
credited certifying agents on aggregate production areas certified
by crop and location in order to accurately calculate organic acre-
age and yield estimates on a country-by-country basis.
Pecans.—The Committee is aware that pecans are nutritious,
and value-added markets offer new potential sources of revenue for
U.S. pecan producers. The Committee encourages the USDA to
support U.S. pecan producers through the development of new do-
mestic and international markets for pecan and pecan-based prod-
ucts including but not limited to shelling and packing, pressing for
oil, bioprocessing, and usage as ingredients in other products.
Regional Food Business Centers.—The Committee recognizes the
important role the North Coasts Region plays for various seafood
products in the National and regional food systems across the coun-
try and supports efforts to strengthen supply chains and increase
and diversify market access for North Coasts Region industry part-
ners, who are responsible for seventy percent of the Nation’s sea-
food. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Secretary to explore
the establishment of a North Coasts Regional Food Business Cen-
ter and where practicable, direct the existing Regional Food Busi-
ness Centers to identify ways to strengthen seafood networks, in-
crease market access for small and mid-sized food entities, and im-
prove the viability of the industry and its products.
Soil Health.—The National Organic Standards require farmers
that voluntarily chose to certify their operation as meeting organic
practices to use farming practices that improve soil health, such as
crop rotations, cover cropping, and pasture-based livestock prac-
tices. By improving soil health, these farming practices also in-
crease the carbon sequestration potential of the soil and improve
the farm’s resilience to extreme weather events and patterns. To
maximize the climate benefits of organic agriculture, the Com-
mittee urges the National Organic Program to increase enforce-
ment efforts to ensure full compliance with the soil health and pas-
ture requirements of USDA organic standards.
Sugar Inspection.—In carrying out molasses testing required by
the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2025, the Committee is con-
cerned that progress is delayed. To ensure timely determinations of

63
whether there is circumvention of the Tariff Rate Quotas on im-
ported sugar and sugar containing products, the Committee directs
that AMS methodology and protocols specifically evaluate whether
product entering the United States under Heading 1703.20,
HTSUS, as molasses, or Heading 1702.90.40, HTSUS, as sugar
syrup blends, fails to meet any one of the following criteria: derived
from sugar cane or beet containing soluble non-sugar solids (ex-
cluding any foreign substance that may have been added or devel-
oped in the product) greater than 6 percent by weight of the total
soluble solids, derived from sugar cane or beet with a Brix value
of 78.5 degrees or greater (determined by ICUMSA Method GS4–
15 (1994), derived from sugar cane with reducing sugar of 15 per-
cent or greater (determined by ICUMSA Method GS4/3–3 (2007), or
derived from sugar beet with a total sugar value of less than 55
percent (determined by ICUMSA Method GS4/3–7 (2011). Each cri-
terion is a practical means of delineating between proper and im-
proper product entry, and the Committee directs AMS to report the
agency’s findings based on these criteria to the Committee and ap-
propriate agencies.
Wild Game Processing Technical Assistance.—The Committee
recognizes the important role of wild game processing in rural food
supply chains, especially in the business models of small and very-
small processors. The Committee encourages AMS to expand the
scope of the existing Meat and Poultry Processing Capacity-Tech-
nical Assistance Program to include assistance for processors inter-
ested in opening or expanding facilities that conduct custom-ex-
empt wild game processing.
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $62,596,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 62,596,000
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97–
35) initiated a system of user fees for the cost of grading and
classing cotton and tobacco. These activities, authorized under the
U.S. Cotton Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 51 et seq.), the Tobacco In-
spection Act (7 U.S.C. 511 et seq.), and other provisions of law are
designed to facilitate commerce and protect participants in the in-
dustry.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a limitation of $62,596,000 on ad-
ministrative expenses of the Agricultural Marketing Service.

Under section 32 of the act of August 24, 1935, (Public Law 74–
320), an amount equal to 30 percent of customs receipts collected
during each preceding calendar year and unused balances are
available for encouraging the domestic consumption and expor-

64
tation of agricultural commodities. An amount equal to 30 percent
of receipts collected on fishery products is transferred to the De-
partment of Commerce. Additional transfers to the child nutrition
programs of the Food and Nutrition Service have been provided in
recent appropriations acts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a transfer from section 32 funds of
$23,880,000 for the formulation and administration of marketing
agreements and orders.

Section 32 Authorities.—Under the authority described in clause
3 of 7 U.S.C. 612c, the Secretary is able to direct funds from the
section 32 account to increase the purchasing power of producers.
This practice has been used on various occasions to provide direct
assistance to producers when market forces or natural conditions
adversely affect the financial condition of farmers and ranchers.
The Committee notes the importance of the ability of the Secretary
to utilize this authority but believes that communication between
USDA and Congress should be improved when this practice is
used. Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide no-

65
tification to the Committee in advance of any public announcement
or release of section 32 funds under the specific authorities cited
above.
PAYMENTS TO STATES AND POSSESSIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,000,000
The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program is author-
ized by section 204(b) of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7
U.S.C. 1621–1627, 1635–1638) and is also funded from appropria-
tions. Matching grants are awarded on a competitive basis to State
marketing agencies to identify and test market alternative farm
commodities, determine methods of providing more reliable market
information, and develop better commodity grading standards. This
program has made many types of projects possible, such as elec-
tronic marketing and agricultural product diversification. Current
projects are focused on the improvement of marketing efficiency
and effectiveness and seeking new outlets for existing farm pro-
duced commodities. The legislation grants USDA authority to es-
tablish cooperative agreements with State departments of agri-
culture or similar State agencies to improve the efficiency of the
agricultural marketing chain. The States perform the work or con-
tract it to others and must contribute at least one-half of the cost
of the projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,000,000 for
Payments to States and Possessions for Federal-State marketing
projects and activities.
LIMITATION ON INSPECTION AND WEIGHING SERVICES EXPENSES
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $55,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,000,000
The agency provides an official grain inspection and weighing
system under the U.S. Grain Standards Act [USGSA] (Public Law
64–190, and official inspection of rice and grain-related products
under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621–1627,
1635–1638). The USGSA was amended in 1981 to require the col-
lection of user fees to fund the costs associated with the operation,
supervision, and administration of Federal grain inspection and
weighing activities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a limitation of $55,000 on inspection
and weighing services expenses.
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOOD SAFETY
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,117,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,117,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety provides direc-
tion and coordination in carrying out the laws enacted by the Con-
gress with respect to the Department’s inspection of meat, poultry,

66
and processed egg products. The Office has oversight and manage-
ment responsibilities for the Food Safety and Inspection Service
[FSIS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,117,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety.
FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,214,009,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,226,000,000
The major objectives of the FSIS are to ensure that meat and
poultry products are wholesome, unadulterated, and properly la-
beled and packaged, as required by the Federal Meat Inspection
Act (Public Law 59–242) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act
(Public Law 85–172), as amended; and to provide continuous in-
plant inspection to egg processing plants under the Egg Products
Inspection Act (Public Law 91–597).
The Food Safety and Inspection Service was established on June
17, 1981, by Secretary’s Memorandum No. 1000–1, issued pursuant
to Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953.
The inspection program of the Food Safety and Inspection Serv-
ice provides in-plant inspection of all domestic plants preparing
meat, poultry, or egg products for sale or distribution; reviews for-
eign inspection systems and establishments that prepare meat or
poultry products for export to the United States; and provides tech-
nical and financial assistance to States which maintain meat and
poultry inspection programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,226,000,000
for the Food Safety and Inspection Service.
The following table represents the Committee’s specific rec-
ommendations for the FSIS as compared to the fiscal year 2025 lev-
els:

Brazilian Beef.—The Committee urges FSIS to maintain current
rates of reinspection tasks for raw beef imports from Brazil and to
adjust rates of import inspection as necessary and consistent with
import compliance history. The Committee also requests FSIS to
continue conducting routine onsite verification audits of the Bra-
zilian inspection system.

67
Good Commercial Practices.—The Committee recognizes that the
handling of birds at slaughter according to Good Commercial Prac-
tices [GCP] reduces the occurrence of adulterated poultry products
that meet the definition of adulteration in the Poultry Products In-
spection Act [PPIA] (21 U.S.C. 453(g)(5)) from entering the market-
place. The Committee directs the USDA to track the GCP
verification activities in FSIS’ Public Health Information System,
which are intended to reduce instances of adulteration.
Humane Slaughter.—The Committee directs FSIS to continue to
provide annual reports to the Committee on the implementation of
objective scoring methods undertaken by FSIS to enforce the Hu-
mane Methods of Slaughter Act (Public Law 85–765). The report
shall also include whether funding opportunities, including grants
and cost share opportunities, exist under current USDA programs
and initiatives that can be utilized by producers for the purpose of
obtaining and maintaining third-party certification of animal-rais-
ing practices.
The Committee further directs FSIS to continue preparation and
online publication of the Humane Handling Quarterly Reports, to
include the number of humane handling verification procedures
performed, the number of administrative enforcement actions
taken, time spent on Humane Handling Activities Tracking System
activities, and comparisons of these measurements by plant size
and FSIS district.
The Committee also directs FSIS to ensure that personnel hired
with funding previously provided specifically for Humane Methods
of Slaughter Act (Public Law 85–765) enforcement focus their at-
tention on overseeing compliance with humane handling rules for
live animals as they arrive and are offloaded and handled in pens,
chutes, and stunning areas and that all inspectors receive robust
training.
Non-Ambulatory Livestock.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall
submit to Congress, 90 days after enactment of this act, a report
on the scope of non-ambulatory livestock at slaughter establish-
ments; the causes that render livestock non-ambulatory at slaugh-
ter establishments; the humane treatment of non-ambulatory live-
stock at slaughter establishments; the public health threat of non-
ambulatory pigs entering the food system, including, at minimum,
the impact on public health from pathogens associated with non-
ambulatory pigs including, but not limited to Salmonella and
Campylobacter.
State Meat and Poultry Inspection [MPI] Programs.—The Com-
mittee is supportive of MPI Programs and recognizes the key role
they play in maintaining the integrity of the Nation’s food supply,
and as such, the Committee provides an additional $15,000,000 to
ensure that the Federal reimbursement rate is 50 percent. As the
Department carries out its responsibilities in administering the
MPI programs, the Committee encourages the department to work
with participating States to ensure that funds are provided in a
timely manner.

TITLE II
FARM PRODUCTION AND CONSERVATION PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FARM PRODUCTION AND
CONSERVATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,527,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,527,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Farm Production and Con-
servation [FPAC] provides direction and coordination in carrying
out the laws enacted by the Congress with respect to the Depart-
ment’s commodity programs, farm loans, disaster assistance, crop
insurance, natural resources conservation and environment pro-
grams, and certain energy programs. The Office has oversight and
management responsibilities for the Farm Service Agency [FSA]
(including the Commodity Credit Corporation), Risk Management
Agency [RMA], and the Natural Resources Conservation Service
[NRCS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,527,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Farm Production and Con-
servation.
Communication.—The Committee is committed to supporting the
mission and values of the Natural Resources Conservation Service,
including through critical investments to protect our land, water,
and soil. The Committee directs NRCS to continue to brief the
Committee on ongoing and upcoming initiatives on a monthly
basis, as well as resources necessary for continued success of the
Service.
Emergency Conservation Program.—The Committee is encour-
aged by the Department’s work to provide advance cost-share pay-
ments under the emergency conservation loan program and emer-
gency forest restoration program. The committee encourages USDA
to further expand advance cost share payments as well as clarify
that wildfires which are not caused naturally but the spread of the
wildfire is due to natural causes or which are caused by the Fed-
eral Government are eligible for the program. Additionally, the De-
partment should explore flexibility in the timeline for utilizing
funding to implement necessary conservation work following a dis-
aster.
Internships.—The Committee understands the importance of re-
cruiting the next generation of staff for both FSA and NRCS. The
Committee directs the Department to provide a report on how in-
terns can be better utilized, including converting interns that work
for third-party partners and any statutory or regulatory changes
that may be necessary.

USDA–Customer and Producer Farm Delivery Systems Mod-
ernization.—The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a plan
within 60 days of enactment of this act that accelerates the contin-
ued implementation and expansion of the Farmers.gov application
and Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset [EDAPT]. De-
spite the continued direction and funding provided by Congress in
previous fiscal years for these modernization applications, the Com-
mittee is aware that the Farm Service Agency, the Farm Produc-
tion and Conservation Business Center, and the Office of the Chief
Information Officer continue to maintain numerous legacy mission
support systems that should be decommissioned and transitioned
to applications and mission support services systems that are inter-
operable, facts-based, data driven, and are provided efficiently, ef-
fectively, and professionally with a commitment to excellent cus-
tomer service for USDA customers, including farmers, ranchers,
and forest landowners.
FARM PRODUCTION AND CONSERVATION BUSINESS CENTER
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $244,183,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 238,500,000
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $238,500,000 for
the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center.
FARM SERVICE AGENCY
The Farm Service Agency was established October 13, 1994, pur-
suant to the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of
Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354). The
FSA administers a variety of activities, such as the commodity
price support and production adjustment programs financed by the
Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC]; the Conservation Reserve
Program [CRP]; the Emergency Conservation Program [ECP]; the
Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised
Fish Program [ELAP]; the Commodity Operation Programs, includ-
ing the warehouse examination function; farm ownership, farm op-
erating, emergency disaster, and other loan programs; and the
Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program [NAP], which pro-
vides crop loss protection for growers of many crops for which crop
insurance is not available. In addition, FSA currently provides cer-
tain administrative support services to the Foreign Agricultural
Service [FAS] and RMA.

The account Salaries and Expenses, Farm Service Agency, funds
the administrative expenses of program administration and other
functions assigned to FSA. The funds consist of appropriations and
transfers from the CCC export credit guarantees, Food for Peace
loans, and Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund program accounts,
as well as miscellaneous advances from other sources. All adminis-
trative funds used by FSA are consolidated into one account. The
consolidation provides clarity and better management and control
of funds and facilitates accounting, fiscal, and budgetary work by
eliminating the necessity for making individual allocations and al-
lotments and maintaining and recording obligations and expendi-
tures under numerous separate accounts.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,515,110,000
for salaries and expenses of the Farm Service Agency, including a
direct appropriation of $1,209,307,000.
Acequia Irrigated Land.—The Committee recognizes that
acequias serve as the primary method of irrigation in many rural
and underserved communities in New Mexico and that acequias re-
main an integral aspect of New Mexican cultural identity. Recent
changes administered by FSA changed eligibility of drought on
farms and ranches irrigated by acequias for the Noninsured Crop
Disaster Assistance Program [NAP]. Given the Farm Service Agen-
cy has historically considered drought on acequia-irrigated land eli-
gible for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance and the ongoing se-
vere drought conditions in New Mexico and throughout the west,
the Committee urges the Department to maintain their position
that drought on acequia-irrigated land is an eligible cause of loss
for NAP.
Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act.—USDA is re-
sponsible for monitoring foreign purchases of agricultural land
under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act [AFIDA]
and for assessing penalties on entities that have failed to make dis-
closures as required. The Committee is concerned that USDA failed
to assess penalties for a failure to disclose foreign investments in
American agricultural land. The Committee directs the Secretary
to report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act
on USDA’s efforts to ensure that foreign investments are being ac-
curately disclosed, including an analysis of any barriers USDA
faces in conducting oversight of these purchases and planned steps
for overcoming these challenges.
Agricultural Production and Farms.—The Committee is con-
cerned about the loss of agricultural production and farms, particu-
larly in New England. Within 180 days of enactment, FSA is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committee on what factors are
leading to agricultural production and farm loss in New England,
to include historical and projected data on acreage and crops types.
Aquaculture Training.—The Committee encourages FSA to dedi-
cate resources to train all county staff on aquaculture farming
practices and aquaculture product eligibility for USDA programs,
as applicable. The Committee also encourages FSA to dedicate re-
sources to assist county staff with aquaculture data and informa-

71
tion collection necessary to inform disaster assistance determina-
tions.
Disaster Preparedness.—The Committee recognizes that millions
of farm animals die each year due to the effects of adverse weather.
The Committee is also aware that veterinary and agricultural trade
associations recognize the importance of disaster planning in pre-
venting the extent of livestock deaths. For these reasons, the
USDA has been directed by the Committee during several of the
past fiscal years to work with producers to develop disaster plans.
The Committee directs USDA to provide a report on the number
or percentage of producers receiving payments under the Livestock
Indemnity Program who have disaster plans in place at the time
of loss, and additional activities conducted by the Department to
promote disaster planning and ensure that livestock and poultry
producers have adequate disaster plans in place to reduce animal
deaths and injuries within 90 days of enactment of the act.
FSA Staffing.— The Committee commends FSA for the analyt-
ical and data-driven work that it has done to identify the appro-
priate staffing levels at county offices and how to most effectively
serve their constituents. The Committee looks forward to con-
tinuing to work with FSA on ensuring county offices are staffed ac-
cordingly. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act and quarterly
therafter, FSA is directed to brief the Committee on its workload
analysis and staffing, and to include planned versus actual hires.
Information Technology.—The Committee remains dedicated to
ensuring FSA has reliable and functioning IT systems because it
is critical that farmers and ranchers have access to the tools they
need to succeed. The Committee has invested significant taxpayer
dollars to modernize outdated systems and continues to provide re-
sources for this effort. The Committee continues statutory language
that allows funds for IT to be obligated only after the Secretary
meets certain reporting requirements. The Committee expects the
agency to follow the recommendations of the third party IT anal-
ysis where applicable. FSA is directed to provide timely updates for
future IT needs.
STATE MEDIATION GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $6,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 6,500,000
This program is authorized under title V of the Agricultural
Credit Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–233). Originally designed to ad-
dress agricultural credit disputes, the program was expanded by
the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture
Reorganization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354) to include other
agricultural issues such as wetland determinations, conservation
compliance, rural water loan programs, grazing on National Forest
System lands, and pesticides. Grants are made to States whose me-
diation programs have been certified by the FSA. Grants will be
solely for operation and administration of the State’s agricultural
mediation program.

72
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $6,500,000 for
State Mediation Grants.
GRASSROOTS SOURCE WATER PROTECTION PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 7,000,000
This program is intended to assist in the protection of ground-
water through State rural water associations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $7,000,000 for
Grassroots Source Water Protection.
DAIRY INDEMNITY PROGRAM
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 500,000
Under the program, the Department makes indemnification pay-
ments to dairy farmers and manufacturers of dairy products who,
through no fault of their own, suffer income losses because they are
directed to remove their milk from commercial markets due to con-
tamination of their products by registered pesticides. The program
also authorizes indemnity payments to dairy farmers for losses re-
sulting from the removal of cows or dairy products from the market
due to nuclear radiation or fallout.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of such sums as
may be necessary, estimated in fiscal year 2026 to be $500,000, for
indemnity payments to dairy farmers.
GEOGRAPHICALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $3,500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 3,500,000
This program is authorized under Title I of the Food, Conserva-
tion, and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8792). Under the Reim-
bursement Transportation Cost Payment Program for Geographi-
cally Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers, the Department off-
sets a portion of the costs of transporting agricultural inputs and
products over long distances for farmers and ranchers outside the
contiguous United States that face tremendously high costs for
transporting agriculture products and inputs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,500,000 for
the Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program for
Geographically Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers.

73
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT INSURANCE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Program Account [ACIF]
is used to provide direct and guaranteed farm ownership, farm op-
erating, conservation, Indian highly fractioned land, and emergency
loans to individuals, as well as the following types of loans to asso-
ciations: irrigation and drainage, grazing, Indian Tribe land acqui-
sition, and boll weevil eradication.
FSA is also authorized to provide financial assistance to bor-
rowers by guaranteeing loans made by private lenders having a
contract of guarantee from FSA as approved by the Secretary of
Agriculture and to establish Beginning Farmer and Rancher Indi-
vidual Development grant accounts.
The following programs are financed through this fund:
Boll Weevil Eradication Loans.—Made to assist foundations in fi-
nancing the operations of the boll weevil eradication programs pro-
vided to farmers.
Emergency Loans.—Made to producers to aid recovery from pro-
duction and physical losses due to drought, flooding, other natural
disasters, or quarantine. The loans may be used to restore or re-
place essential property; pay all or part of production costs associ-
ated with the disaster year; pay essential family living expenses;
reorganize the farming operation; and refinance certain debts.
Farm Operating Loans.—Provide short-to-intermediate term pro-
duction or chattel credit to farmers who cannot obtain credit else-
where, to improve their farm and home operations, and to develop
or maintain a reasonable standard of living. The term of the loan
varies from one to 7 years.
Farm Ownership Loans.—Made to borrowers who cannot obtain
credit elsewhere to restructure their debts, improve or purchase
farms, refinance nonfarm enterprises which supplement but do not
supplant farm income, or make additions to farms. Loans are made
for 40 years or less.
Indian Tribe Land Acquisition Loans.—Made to any Indian Tribe
recognized by the Secretary of the Interior or Tribal corporation es-
tablished pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act (Public Law
93–638) which does not have adequate uncommitted funds to ac-
quire lands or interest in lands within the Tribe’s reservation or
Alaskan Indian community, as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, for use of the Tribe or the corporation or the members
thereof.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a total loan level of $10,477,388,000
for programs within the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Pro-
gram Account.
The following table reflects the program levels for farm credit
programs administered by the Farm Service Agency recommended

RISK MANAGEMENT AGENCY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $65,637,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 65,637,000
The Risk Management Agency performs administrative functions
relative to the Federal Crop Insurance program that is authorized
by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508), as amended by
the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 [ARPA] (Public Law

75
106–224), the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–79), and
the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–334).
ARPA authorized significant changes in the crop insurance pro-
gram. This act provides higher government subsidies for producer
premiums to make coverage more affordable; expands research and
development for new insurance products and under-served areas
through contracts with the private sector; and strengthens compli-
ance. Functional areas of risk management are: research and de-
velopment; insurance services; and compliance, the functions of
which include policy formulation and procedures and regulations
development.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $65,637,000 for
Risk Management Agency, Salaries and Expenses.
The Committee recognizes that there are many research prior-
ities that competitive funding may be used to address, including
the feasibility of insurance programs to cover business interruption
due to integrator bankruptcy and catastrophic loss in the poultry
industry. The Committee encourages RMA to support research into
these priorities.
Administrative and Operating Expenses.—The Committee en-
courages the RMA to provide an annual inflation adjustment to ad-
ministrative and operating [A&O] reimbursements and to provide
equitable relief for specialty crop policies in a manner similar to a
previous adjustment that was initiated without renegotiation of the
Standard Reinsurance Agreement.
Alfalfa.—The Committee recognizes alfalfa to be an important
domestic forage crop valued for nitrogen fixation, soil conservation,
crop rotation, and as a natural habitat. From 2004 through 2025,
alfalfa acreage has declined 27.8 percent. The Committee encour-
ages RMA to explore the creation of a revenue and/or quality al-
falfa crop insurance policy to ensure producers have a safety net
that they need to produce this important crop.
Biofuels.—The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture,
within 12 months after the date of the enactment of this act, and
in consultation with the Risk Management Agency, the Farm Serv-
ice Agency, and the Natural Resource Conservation Service, to sub-
mit to Congress a written report on how the Department can
streamline opportunities for farmers to insure primary and sec-
ondary crops with revenue streams resulting from biofuel use, in-
cluding but not limited to sustainable aviation fuel, with particular
reference to carinata, pennycress, camelina, and other oilseeds.
Crop Insurance in New England.—The Committee is concerned
that growers in New England are underserved by the Federal crop
insurance program. The Committee emphasizes RMA’s authority to
design actuarially sound crop insurance policies that reflect re-
gional differences in growing practices and conditions, as well as
crop diversity and marketing practices. The Committee appreciates
RMA’s decision to convene a working group of New England apple
growers to help better inform future policies and encourages RMA
to consider convening similar working groups for regional growers
of other crops. RMA is directed to report to the Committee within

76
180 days on its outreach efforts on this issue as well as its plans
for additional working groups.
NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE
The Natural Resources Conservation Service was established
pursuant to the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of
1994 (Public Law 103–354). The NRCS works with conservation
districts, watershed groups, and Federal and State agencies to
bring about physical adjustments in land use that will conserve soil
and water resources, provide for agricultural production on a sus-
tained basis, and reduce flood damage and sedimentation.

Conservation operations are authorized by Public Law 74–46 (16
U.S.C. 590a-590f). Activities include:
Conservation Technical Assistance provides assistance to district
cooperators and other land users in the planning and application
of conservation treatments to control erosion and improve the
quantity and quality of soil resources; improve and conserve water;
enhance fish and wildlife habitat; conserve energy; improve wood-
land, pasture, and range conditions; and reduce upstream flooding
to protect and enhance the natural resource base.
Resource appraisal and program development ensures that pro-
grams administered by the Secretary for the conservation of soil,
water, and related resources shall respond to the Nation’s long-
term needs.
Plant Materials Centers assemble, test, and encourage increased
use of plant species which show promise for use in the treatment
of conservation problem areas.
Snow Survey and Water Forecasting provides estimates of an-
nual water availability from high mountain snow packs and sum-
mer stream flow in the Western States and Alaska. Information is
used by agriculture, industry, and cities in estimating future water
supplies.
Soil Surveys inventory the Nation’s basic soil resources and de-
termine land capabilities and conservation treatment needs. Soil
survey publications include interpretations useful to cooperators,
other Federal and State agencies, and local organizations.

Total, Conservation Operations ......................................................................... 895,754 895,754
Acre-for-Acre Wetlands Mitigation.—The Secretary is encouraged
to use mitigation with the conversion of a natural wetland and
equivalent wetlands functions at a ratio which does not exceed 1-
to-1 acreage.
Agricultural Open Burning Alternatives.—The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the Environmental Quality Incentive Pro-
gram [EQIP], which provides Federal funding and technical assist-
ance to farmers throughout the Nation. The Committee urges
USDA to prioritize EQIP awards to projects that enable the pur-
chase of equipment to process agricultural woody waste generated
from orchard and vineyard removals as an alternative to open
burning.
Bio-Diverse Microbial Soil Health.—The Committee recognizes
that research and data continue to show that improved soil health
via bio-diverse microbial soil amendments has a significant positive
impact for American farm and ranch lands, supporting an essential
domestic asset in a global market. The Committee encourages
USDA to support the expanded and continued use of these multi-
kingdom biologic soil health solutions across a broad range of Nat-
ural Resources Conservation Service programs, including the Envi-
ronmental Quality Incentives Program, to address soil health bene-
fits related to yield increase, advanced root development, input effi-
ciency, improved water efficacy, catastrophic soil damage restora-
tion, and catalysts to other soil health practices such as reduced
tillage.
Code 590.—The Committee recognizes the need for NRCS to up-
date the Nutrient Management Conservation Practice Standard
(Code 590) and related practices to enhance nutrient efficiency and
reduce environmental impacts. Scenario #27 under Practice Stand-
ard 441 supports manure application via dripline systems and has
enabled ‘‘SDI, Manure’’ cost-share programs in California, Oregon,
and Washington through EQIP. However, this scenario is not
broadly applicable, and the 2-in-5-year Irrigation History Require-
ment under Standard 441 poses a barrier for non-irrigated farmers,
inadvertently encouraging inefficient irrigation solely to qualify for
funding. To address this, the Committee encourages USDA to ex-
pand eligibility for SDI (subsurface drip irrigation) systems in nu-
trient management beyond current geographic and operational lim-
its and to incorporate them under Code 590.
Critical Conservation Areas [CCA].—The Committee supports
CCAs and the collaborative regional approach to address common
natural resources goals while maintaining or improving agricul-
tural productivity. The Committee urges NRCS to provide suffi-
cient Conservation Technical Assistance funds to CCAs to address

78
conservation planning backlogs. The Committee also encourages
NRCS to leverage all possible resources to identify nutrient loss
and reduce runoff to achieve the goals of the 2015 Gulf Hypoxia Ac-
tion Plan.
Drought Resilience.—The Committee applauds the passage of the
Colorado River Basin Drought Contingency Plans, appreciates ef-
forts to increase efficiencies, and expects NRCS to utilize all avail-
able opportunities to assist producers, irrigators, and irrigation dis-
tricts in addressing drought resiliency and mitigation while main-
taining strong rural and agriculture communities and protecting
natural resources. NRCS is expected to prioritize implementation of
Drought Contingency Plans, agreements, or programs that con-
serve surface or ground water, improve drought resiliency, and ad-
dress current and anticipated conservation needs and drought-re-
lated resource concerns.
Furthermore, the Committee encourages NRCS to enter into ad-
ditional cooperative agreements with the Appropriate Technology
Transfer for Rural Areas program to develop additional state or re-
gion specific healthy soil and water management best practice
guides to support drought resilience and soil health in the western
United States.
Fencing.—The Committee directs the agency to explore ways to
maximize assistance to producers with wildlife exclusion fencing
within the authority provided by the Environmental Quality Incen-
tive Program.
Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative.—The Committee provides
$10,000,000 for the Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative (16
U.S.C. 3839bb), of which $8,000,000 shall be provided through
State allocations as competitive grants to diverse partnerships, in-
cluding socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and their or-
ganizations, to provide technical assistance to producers for grazing
planning and implementation, conferences and other education,
demonstrations, producer networks, workforce training, research,
and outreach projects to improve agricultural resilience. NRCS is
directed to provide the remaining $2,000,000 through a cooperative
agreement with a national grazing lands conservation coalition to
establish diverse State-based coalitions and to undertake grazing
education.
Interagency Coordination.—The Committee directs the Natural
Resources Conservation Service to work with the Bureau of Rec-
lamation to expand interagency coordination of Federal invest-
ments in communities that need help addressing water conserva-
tion and drought resilience issues.
Additionally, the Committee encourages NRCS to work more
closely with the Fish and Wildlife Service for all volunteer pro-
grams that promote fish and wildlife conservation efforts, through
cooperative agreements, to continue to provide free technical and fi-
nancial assistance to landowners, managers, tribes, corporations,
schools, and nonprofits interested in improving wildlife habitat on
their land. Both agencies should continue to collaborate on stream-
lining ESA listings and consultations especially for large-ranged
species and for geographies where multiple listed species overlap in
their ranges.

79
Land Grants and Acequias.—The Committee recognizes that sec-
tion 2304(e) of Public Law 115–334 allows acequias and land grant
mercedes to apply directly to the Environmental Quality Incentives
Program [EQIP], which provides Federal funding and technical as-
sistance to farmers throughout the Nation. The Committee appre-
ciates that there are hundreds of acequias and dozens of land
grants in New Mexico that can now gain direct access to this im-
portant conservation program. The Committee urges USDA to de-
velop EQIP guidance that ensures timely input from local commu-
nities, including listening sessions with land grants and acequias
and directs NRCS to update the Committee on these efforts within
90 days of enactment of this Act.
Migratory Big Game Initiative.—The Committee recognizes that
working farms and ranches can provide important migratory habi-
tat for big game and other wildlife species and commends NRCS
and FSA on their collaboration with State Governments and other
partners to conserve these important working lands. The innova-
tive application of Grassland CRP and EQIP in tandem is espe-
cially important. Leveraging the unique payments, cost-share, and
technical assistance that these programs provide against one an-
other-as is being done through the USDA Migratory Big Game Ini-
tiative in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho-provides expanded support
and management flexibility for producers stewarding wildlife habi-
tat while keeping lands in production. The NRCS and FSA are en-
couraged to cooperate in expanding this innovative model to other
States. The Committee directs NRCS to submit a report to the
Committee within 90 days of enactment of this act on the progress
made in implementing the Migratory Big Game Initiative, out-
lining plans for expanding the Migratory Big Game Initiative into
additional States, and identifying barriers to achieving the goals
outlined by the initiative.
National Resources Inventory.—In reinstating the National Re-
sources Inventory in Alaska, the Committee expects NRCS to take
into account sample design, data collection software, and data proc-
essing capability in order to collect and produce scientifically cred-
ible information on the status, condition, and trends of Alaska’s
lands, soils, waters, and related resources.
Private Land Conservation.—The Committee recognizes the im-
portance of providing private land owners with ready access to the
many Federal, State, and local government and private resources
available to support conservation efforts on private lands. The
Committee directs NRCS to implement a multi-year cooperative
agreement with appropriate funding support to an organization
that can make conservation solutions and best practices accessible
daily to private land owners. This organization should also support
efforts to conserve the lesser-prairie chicken and implement carbon
sequestration conservation programs nationwide.
Soil Health.—The Committee recognizes that improving soil
health on agricultural lands is key to achieving both meaningful
conservation and economic benefits for producers. The Committee
is pleased to see strong stakeholder interest in the new on-farm
conservation innovation trials to test new or innovative conserva-
tion approaches and the soil health demonstration trial, which pro-
vides incentives to producers to implement practices that improve

80
soil health and increase carbon levels in the soil. The Committee
encourages the Secretary to dedicate more technical assistance
funds to establish standard protocols for measuring and testing
carbon levels to evaluate gains in soil health that will help pro-
ducers to create positive economic, environmental, and social out-
comes through ecosystem service markets. The Committee believes
the Secretary should provide additional technical assistance related
to healthy soil planning, soil carbon sequestration, and conserva-
tion activity planning. NRCS is urged to support the expansion of
existing State soil health programs and to assist interested States
in establishing new State soil health programs.
SNOTEL.—The Committee continues to be concerned by docu-
mented changes in winter weather across the country, and the im-
pact of those changes on local ecologies and economies. The Com-
mittee continues to fund the NRCS Snow Telemetry Network and
provides an additional $2,000,000 to complete a multi-phased feasi-
bility study for SNOTEL in the Northeast that includes regional
collaboration with State agencies, land-grant universities, non-gov-
ernmental organizations, private landowners, and private indus-
tries and to begin implementation of the Snow Survey and Water
Supply Forecasting Program to serve the Northeastern United
States. The Secretary is directed to brief the Committee on next
steps once the feasibility study is completed.
Streamlined Conservation Planning.—The Committee directs
NRCS to develop a streamlined conservation planning and applica-
tion process for small acreage operations to reduce the time and ef-
fort required by both the applicant and local NRCS staff to process
conservation program applications.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee directs NRCS to maintain
a record of total technical assistance dollars for the past 3 years
and annually in the future and to provide the data to the Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Agriculture and the Committee on Agri-
culture Nutrition and Forestry. This report should differentiate be-
tween mandatory and discretionary allocations.
Technical Service Providers.—The Committee urges NRCS to re-
evaluate the current matching requirements for the Technical
Service Provider program supporting State and Tribal soil health
programs.
Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production Grants.—It is the
Committee’s understanding that grant recipients may offer sub-
awards to agricultural producers so long as they meet relevant reg-
ulatory requirements. The committee supports this usage of grant
funds and encourages the agency to inform potential applicants of
this approved use in all relevant application materials using plain
language.
Virtual Fencing Technologies.—The Committee supports further
investments in research regarding the positive impacts and bene-
fits of virtual fencing compared to traditional fencing on grazing
lands. The Committee directs the Natural Resources Conservation
Service to compile all available research data and submit a report,
within 90 days of enactment of this act, on the positive impacts of
precision agriculture grazing technologies, including virtual fenc-
ing, to improve soil health, grazing outcomes, and profitability.

81
Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program.—The
Committee recognizes the important role of the Voluntary Public
Access and Habitat Incentive Program [VPA–HIP] in creating and
enhancing fish and wildlife habitat and addressing a major barrier
to hunting and fishing participation: lack of access to quality places
to hunt and fish, including lakes, streams, wetlands, grasslands,
forests, and agricultural land. VPA–HIP uses a locally led, vol-
untary framework to incentivize willing private landowners to
allow access for wildlife dependent recreation. This stimulates
rural economies by increasing hunting and fishing participation
and enhances outdoor recreational opportunities nationwide. Recog-
nizing this, the Natural Resources Conservation Service is encour-
aged to expedite the distribution of any funds allocated to this pro-
gram and to support program continuity by issuing 5-year grant
awards.
Western States Conservation Partnership Initiative.—The Com-
mittee recognizes the value of collaborative, locally-led conservation
practices and remains concerned about the ongoing extreme
drought and related water issues in the American West. NRCS is
encouraged to explore the creation of a partnership initiative, simi-
lar to the recently created Chesapeake Bay States’ Partnership Ini-
tiative, to allow Western States and partners to leverage financial
and technical assistance to address regional water issues and help
build resilience to drought. Within 90 days of enactment of this act,
NRCS is directed to brief the Committee on the feasibility of such
an initiative, as well as efforts undertaken to this end.
Western Water and Working Lands.—The Committee welcomes
additional progress in operationalizing Western Water and Work-
ing Lands Framework for Conservation Action, and encourages
NRCS to dedicate financial and technical assistance resources to
support the framework, with a priority on projects with multiple
benefits. The Secretary is directed to keep the Committee apprised
of progress toward this end, beginning with a briefing 90 days after
enactment of this act.
White Oak Initiative.—White oak forests are critical for wildlife,
biodiversity, and forest products, and without swift action by pri-
vate landowners and land management agencies, there will be a
significant decline of white oak forests in the future. The Com-
mittee commends NRCS for its work to encourage white oak con-
servation and promote white oak reforestation practices and en-
courages NRCS to expand and coordinate these efforts across its
programs with the U.S. Forest Service.
Wildlife Habitat on Private Lands.—The Committee recognizes
that conservation of wildlife habitat on private lands is essential
for the recovery of many threatened and endangered species. While
Federal programs that provide direct conservation assistance can
be important contributors to species recovery efforts, such pro-
grams might not be available to, or appropriate for, all private
landowners. Private landowners interested in habitat conservation
must be empowered with access to the full range of conservation
resources that exist across the Federal Government, State and local
governments, non-profit organizations, and private entities. The
Committee encourages NRCS to provide grants to, or enter into co-
operative agreements with, non-profit organizations with expertise

82
and experience in amalgamating and providing public access to in-
formation and resources pertaining to the conservation of wildlife
habitat on private lands.
Working Lands for Wildlife.—The Committee reminds NRCS
that supporting wildlife habitat is an important part of its mission,
and encourages NRCS to continue expanding the Working Lands
for Wildlife [WLFW] Initiative. The Committee directs NRCS to
dedicate sufficient staff positions to WLFW, and to coordinate with
the Farm Service Agency on WLFW. The Committee further directs
the Under Secretary of Farm Production and Conservation to pro-
vide a report to the Committee within 120 days of enactment of
this act on the current activities and expansion of WLFW, includ-
ing identification of barriers or challenges to further expansion in
areas such as western migratory big game, northeastern deciduous
forests, Southern pines, SE aquatics, and overall habitat
connectivity across framework geographies. The report should cover
work within existing biome frameworks and identify a path to-
wards expanding to new biomes in the United States where pri-
ority resource concerns are identified.
WATERSHED AND FLOOD PREVENTION OPERATIONS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,650,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 52,360,000
The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Public Law
83–566) (16 U.S.C. 1000–1005, 1007–1009) provides for cooperation
between the Federal Government and the States and their political
subdivisions in a program to prevent erosion, floodwater, and sedi-
ment damages in the watersheds or rivers and streams and to fur-
ther the conservation, development, utilization, and disposal of
water and the conservation and proper utilization of land in au-
thorized watersheds.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $52,360,000 for
the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program [WFPO],
of which the Committee provides $32,360,000 for congressionally
directed projects, as specified in the table at the end of the report,
for new and ongoing watershed and flood prevention activities.
The Committee recognizes the critical challenges facing rural
water resource management and protection and supports needed
investments in watershed operations. These Federal-State-local
partnerships are uniquely positioned to identify critical watershed
protection and flood prevention needs in rural communities and im-
plement projects that deliver multiple streams of benefits for
homes, businesses, transportation infrastructure, and natural re-
sources. In selecting projects for funding, the Committee expects
the agency to balance the needs of addressing the project backlog,
remediation of existing structures, and new projects.
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under Watershed
and Flood Prevention Operations. While the Committee has pro-
vided the funding, recipients of CDS are still required to apply for
the funding and must meet all statutory and regulatory require-

83
ments. The Committee expects the agency to review the applica-
tions and fund projects in the same manner as in previous years.
Multiple Benefit Projects.—The Committee is concerned with the
funding distribution of Watershed and Flood Prevention Oper-
ations, in particular NRCS’ resistance to supporting drought resil-
iency and mitigation in the western United States. Therefore, the
Committee continues to support funding for irrigation moderniza-
tion projects that provide multiple benefits which are primarily
found in the West, including but not limited to reduction of drought
impact, improvement of water quality or in-stream flow, off-channel
renewable energy production, and increased fish or wildlife habitat.
NRCS is directed to keep the Committee apprised of streamlining
and modernization efforts for the watershed planning process, and
of efforts to coordinate with stakeholders and other agencies to en-
sure that this program is utilized in an efficient and equitable
manner to maximize its effect.
Technical Assistance Flexibility.—The Committee directs the Sec-
retary to provide greater flexibility to State Conservationists to be
able to utilize technical assistance dedicated for certain WFPO
funds for administration and planning Statewide for all WFPO
projects.
WATERSHED REHABILITATION PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,000,000
The Watershed Rehabilitation Program account provides for
technical and financial assistance to carry out rehabilitation of
structural measures, in accordance with section 14 of the Water-
shed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, approved August 4, 1954
(16 U.S.C. 1012, U.S.C. 1001, et seq.), as amended by section 313
of Public Law 106–472, November 9, 2000, and by section 2803 of
Public Law 110–246.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,000,000 for
the Watershed Rehabilitation Program.
The Committee recognizes the large backlog of community infra-
structure projects eligible for financial and technical assistance
from the Watershed Rehabilitation Program to address safety con-
cerns, public health, and environmental impacts of aging dams.
NRCS is urged to prioritize the rehabilitation of dams that pose the
greatest risk to public safety.
CORPORATIONS
FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE CORPORATION FUND
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $14,581,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 14,264,000,000
The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended by the Federal
Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354), author-
izes the payment of expenses, which may include indemnity pay-
ments; loss adjustment; delivery expenses; program-related re-
search and development; startup costs for implementing this legis-

84
lation, such as studies, pilot projects, data processing improve-
ments, and public outreach; and related tasks and functions.
All program costs, except for Federal salaries and expenses, are
mandatory expenditures subject to appropriation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of such sums as
may be necessary, estimated to be $14,264,000,000 in fiscal year
2026, for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Fund.
COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION FUND
The Commodity Credit Corporation is a wholly owned Govern-
ment corporation created in 1933 to stabilize, support, and protect
farm income and prices; to help maintain balanced and adequate
supplies of agricultural commodities, including products, foods,
feeds, and fibers; and to help in the orderly distribution of these
commodities. CCC was originally incorporated under a Delaware
charter and was reincorporated June 30, 1948, as a Federal cor-
poration within USDA by the Commodity Credit Corporation Char-
ter Act (Public Law 80–806), approved June 29, 1948.
The Commodity Credit Corporation engages in buying, selling,
lending, and other activities with respect to agricultural commod-
ities, their products, food, feed, and fibers. Its purposes include sta-
bilizing, supporting, and protecting farm income and prices; main-
taining the balance and adequate supplies of selected commodities;
and facilitating the orderly distribution of such commodities. In ad-
dition, the Corporation makes available materials and facilities re-
quired in connection with the storage and distribution of such com-
modities. The Corporation also disburses funds for sharing of costs
with producers for the establishment of approved conservation
practices on environmentally sensitive land and subsequent rental
payments for such land for the duration of CRP contracts.
Corporation activities are primarily governed by the following
statutes: the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (Public
Law 80–806), as amended; the Agricultural Act of 1949 (Public Law
81–439), as amended (1949 Act); the Agricultural Adjustment Act
of 1938 (Public Law 75–430), as amended (the 1938 Act); the Food
Security Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–198), as amended (1985 Act);
the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–
246); the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–79); and the Ag-
riculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–334).
Management of the Corporation is vested in a board of directors,
subject to the general supervision and direction of the Secretary of
Agriculture, who is an ex officio director and chairman of the
board. The board consists of seven members, in addition to the Sec-
retary, who are appointed by the President of the United States
with the advice and consent of the Senate. Officers of the Corpora-
tion are designated according to their positions in USDA.
The activities of the Corporation are carried out mainly by the
personnel and through FSA facilities and FSA State and county
committees. The Foreign Agricultural Service, the General Sales
Manager, other agencies and offices of the Department, and com-

85
mercial agents are also used to carry out certain aspects of the Cor-
poration’s activities.
Under Public Law 87–155 (15 U.S.C. 713a-11, 713a-12), annual
appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year, commencing
with fiscal year 1961. These appropriations are to reimburse the
Corporation for net realized losses.
REIMBURSEMENT FOR NET REALIZED LOSSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $13,863,086,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 13,491,380,000
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of such sums as
may be necessary, estimated in fiscal year 2026 to be
$13,491,380,000, for the payment to reimburse the Commodity
Credit Corporation for reimbursement for net realized losses.
CRP Wetland Restoration and Wildlife Enhancement.—The Com-
mittee notes that agricultural commodity crops, if left unharvested,
may help reduce degradation of wetlands and improve sediment
trapping, surface and ground water supply, erosion control, and
wildlife habitat while providing winter food for waterfowl and other
wildlife. The Committee directs CCC, within 60 days of enactment
of this act, to amend its program policies and guidelines for CRP
conservation practices CP23 and CP23A, to provide that current
and future participants are permitted to plant, but not harvest, ag-
ricultural commodity crops as wildlife food plots on up to 10 per-
cent of the enrolled land to enhance waterfowl and upland bird
food and habitat.
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
(LIMITATION ON EXPENSES)
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $15,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 15,000,000
The CCC’s hazardous waste management program is intended to
ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (Public Law 96–510) and
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (Public Law 94–580).
The CCC funds operations and maintenance costs as well as site
investigation and cleanup expenses. Investigative and cleanup costs
associated with the management of CCC hazardous waste are also
paid from USDA’s hazardous waste management appropriation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends a limitation of $15,000,000 for the
Commodity Credit Corporation’s hazardous waste management
program.

TITLE III
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agri-
culture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354) abolished
the Farmers Home Administration, Rural Development Adminis-
tration, and Rural Electrification Administration and replaced
those agencies with the Rural Housing and Community Develop-
ment Service, (currently, the Rural Housing Service), Rural Busi-
ness and Cooperative Development Service (currently, the Rural
Business-Cooperative Service), and Rural Utilities Service and
placed them under the oversight of the Under Secretary for Rural
Economic and Community Development, (currently, Rural Develop-
ment [RD]). These agencies deliver a variety of programs through
a network of State and field offices.
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,620,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,620,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Rural Development pro-
vides direction and coordination in carrying out laws with respect
to the Department’s rural economic and community development
activities. The Office has oversight and management responsibil-
ities for the Rural Housing Service [RHS], Rural Business-Coopera-
tive Service [RBS], and the Rural Utilities Service [RUS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,620,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Rural Development.
PAWS Act.—The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture
to continue coordinating with the Departments of Justice, Housing
and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services to effi-
ciently implement the grant program for providing emergency and
transitional shelter options for domestic violence survivors with
companion animals.
Persistent Poverty Areas.—The Committee supports targeted in-
vestments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty
counties, and directs the Department to complete the report re-
quested on this matter, which is now several years overdue. The
report shall include both the historic data requested in the original
directive as well as data for fiscal years 2025 and 2026.
Substantially Underserved Trust Area [SUTA].—The Committee
directs Rural Development to define the term ‘substantially under-
served trust area’ in the State of Hawaii to include land located
within the same county as a community located on trust lands as
defined in section 3765 of title 38, United States Code. The term
(86)

87
‘substantially underserved trust area’ means a community in trust
land (as defined in section 3765 of title 38, United States Code)
with respect to which the Secretary determines has a high need for
the benefits of an eligible program. SUTA related investments
within the same county as a community located on trust lands
must primarily benefit Native Hawaiians.

penses of Rural Development, including a direct appropriation of
$351,087,000.
Field Office Analysis.—The Committee directs Rural Develop-
ment to complete a comprehensive analysis of their field offices.
This analysis shall include an initial data pull of all field offices by
county and the number of employees working in each office, as well
as which offices are co-located with FSA and NRCS. Rural Develop-
ment shall brief the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this
act on this initial analysis. Following this initial analysis, Rural
Development shall conduct an analysis in the same manner as FSA
has done.
Quarterly Reviews.—The Committee directs the Department to
continue to provide quarterly briefings to the Committees and to
send reports ahead of the briefings covering the following topics: in-
formation technology report with updates on retiring legacy sys-
tems, making improvements to existing systems, and moving pro-
grams away from paper-based applications; staffing report that
breaks out staffing by program, including planned versus actual
hiring by pay period; a commitment and obligation report; and
Congressionally Directed Spending obligation report. The quarterly

reports should also include key operational metrics to ensure the
Committee receives a complete picture of how RD is implementing
its programs and using its funding to do so.
RURAL HOUSING SERVICE
The Rural Housing Service was established under the Federal
Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganiza-
tion Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354).
RURAL HOUSING INSURANCE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 (budget authority) ............................................. $565,858,000
Committee recommendation (budget authority) ................................. 612,206,000
This fund was established in 1965 (Public Law 89–117) pursuant
to section 517 of title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 87–
171). This fund may be used to insure or guarantee rural housing
loans for single-family homes, rental and cooperative housing, farm
labor housing, and rural housing sites. Rural housing loans are
made to construct, improve, alter, repair, or replace dwellings and
essential farm service buildings that are modest in size, design,
and cost. Rental housing insured loans are made to individuals,
corporations, associations, trusts, or partnerships to provide low-
cost rental housing and related facilities in rural areas. These loans
are repayable in terms up to 30 years. The Multi-family Housing
Preservation and Revitalization Program [MPR] includes revitaliza-
tion tools for maintenance of existing units. The Federal Credit Re-
form Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508) established the Rural Hous-
ing Insurance Fund [RHIF] program account. Appropriations to
this account will be used to cover the lifetime subsidy costs associ-
ated with the direct loans obligated and loan guarantees committed
in fiscal year 2026, as well as for administrative expenses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $199,952,000,
excluding the transfer of funds, for the Rural Housing Insurance
Fund Program Account.
The following table presents the loan subsidy levels as compared
to the 2025 levels:

Fair Housing Protections.—The Committee supports efforts to
strengthen the protections of the Fair Housing Act, but under-
stands that more action is needed to ensure these protections reach
every community. The Committee is still awaiting information on
what resources are needed to ensure Rural Development has the
resources to collaborate with the Department of Housing and
Urban Development in order to conduct outreach and raise aware-
ness of the rights and protections under the Fair Housing Act for
all protected classes.
Farm Labor Housing.—The Committee urges the Rural Housing
Service [RHS] to release farm labor housing funding announce-
ments on an annual basis and expects RHS to increase consultation
with stakeholders.
Multifamily Housing Technical Assistance.—The Committee pro-
vides $2,000,000 for the multifamily housing technical assistance
pilot and directs the Department to prioritize maturing mortgages.
The Committee intends for this technical assistance to assist in
preservation beyond just non-profit transfer deals, including for
maturing properties looking to decouple their mortgage and rental
assistance.
Relending Program.—The Committee provides $5,000,000 in loan
level for the Section 502 Direct Tribal Relending Pilot, and to the
extent practicable, encourages the Rural Housing Service to expand
the current pilot to the Southwest and to Native CDFIs that are
partnered with Regional Housing Authorities which receive block
grant funds under Public Law 104–330. The Committee recognizes
that there is a tremendous need for safe and affordable housing in
American Indian and Alaska Native communities, and Native
American CDFIs have deep ties to the local communities they
serve, and are better equipped to more effectively reach potential
homebuyers.
The Committee directs the Secretary to allow Tribally Des-
ignated Housing Entities [TDHEs] and other entities, such as Na-

90
tive Community Development Financial Institutions [NCDFIs], to
act as intermediary lenders for the purposes of the demonstration
program.
Section 502 Manufactured Home Loans.—The Committee directs
USDA to continue to update Section 502 procedures and regula-
tions to clearly allow for Section 502 home loans to be made to fi-
nance manufactured homes sited in resident-owned communities,
and to brief the Committee on its work to do so within 90 days of
enactment of this act.
Section 523 and 524 Site Development Loans.—The Committee
recognizes the extreme need for more housing in many rural areas
across the country and believes the changes made to extend the
term of Section 523 and 524 site development loans in the Fiscal
Year 2024 Appropriations bill could help meet that demand. The
Committee directs the Department to work to support rural hous-
ing stakeholders in understanding and utilizing the revised loans
and to brief the Committee on any changes to demand for Section
523 and 524 loans within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Single Family Housing Program Access.—The Committee is con-
cerned that there are unnecessary impediments facing individuals
who utilize Single Family Housing Direct Loans and the Single
Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program to purchase homes or
property in rural areas. The Committee reminds the Department
that efficient review and approval of these applications is essential
to the success of these programs, especially in the current housing
market. Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to
submit a report, within 60 days of enactment, on the current ap-
praisal requirements for these homes and how they compare to re-
quirements used by the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment or the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Tribal Property Valuation Project.—The Committee directs the
Secretary to increase outreach to Tribal, Alaska Native, and Native
Hawaiian communities to increase awareness and utilization of the
502 Guaranteed Loans Tribal Property Valuation Project. The
Committee directs the Secretary to report to Congress before the
pilot program is terminated, including on the pilot program’s im-
pacts on breaking down barriers in lending on Tribal lands and in
assisting more eligible very low to moderate income applicants
seeking to purchase or rehabilitate affordable housing on Tribal
lands.
RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,642,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,715,000,000
Rental assistance is authorized under section 521(a)(2) of the
Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 87–171). The objective of the pro-
gram is to reduce rents paid by low-income families living in RHS-
financed rental projects and farm labor housing projects. Under
this program, low-income tenants will contribute the higher of: (1)
30 percent of monthly adjusted income; (2) 10 percent of monthly
income; or (3) designated housing payments from a welfare agency.
Payments from the fund are made to the project owner for the
difference between the tenant’s payment and the approved rental
rate established for the unit.

91
The program is administered in tandem with RHS section 515
rural rental housing program and the farm labor loan and grant
programs. Priority is given to existing projects for rental units oc-
cupied by over-burdened low-income families and projects experi-
encing financial difficulties beyond the control of the owner.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,715,000,000
for the Rental Assistance Program. Housing vouchers continue to
be addressed in the Rural Housing Voucher Account.
Decoupling of Rental Assistance.—The Committee continues to
provide authority for the Department to decouple the rental assist-
ance program from Section 515 direct loans. The Committee re-
minds the Department that this strategy should only be used when
all other methods of preservation are exhausted and directs the De-
partment to provide the Committee with quarterly updates on the
implementation of this policy. Additionally, the Committee provides
$1,000,000 for the Department to make the necessary information
technology upgrades to facilitate its decoupling efforts.
The Committee also supports uniform standards for any sale or
transfer of a property financed with a loan under section 515 to
any entity, including a non-profit organization, that is seeking to
acquire such property through section 515 financing or any low-in-
come housing tax credit under section 42 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.
Multifamily Housing Preservation Strategy.—The Committee di-
rects the Department to consider all preservation tools at its dis-
posal and to develop a report within 6 months of enactment of this
act with its multifamily housing preservation strategy including
goals, objectives, timeline, resources required, and tools to be uti-
lized.
Rental Assistance Priority.—The Secretary is encouraged to
prioritize multi-family housing properties acquired by means of a
section 515 loan within the current fiscal year when determining
current rental assistance needs.
RURAL HOUSING VOUCHER ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $48,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 48,000,000
The Rural Housing Voucher Program was authorized under the
Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171) to assist very low-income
families and individuals who reside in rental housing in rural
areas. Housing vouchers may be provided to residents of rental
housing projects financed by section 515 loans that have been pre-
paid or paid off after September 30, 2005. Voucher amounts reflect
the difference between comparable market rents and tenant-paid
rent prior to loan pre-payment. Vouchers allow tenants to remain
in existing projects or move to other rental housing.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $48,000,000 for
the Rural Housing Voucher Program. The Committee requests his-
toric data and projections of dollars and units served for rural

92
housing vouchers and rental assistance with the assumption that
the decoupling authority will continue to stay in place.
MUTUAL AND SELF-HELP HOUSING GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $25,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 25,000,000
The Mutual and Self-Help Housing Grants Program is author-
ized by title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171).
Grants are made to local organizations to promote the development
of mutual or self-help programs under which groups of usually 6
to 10 families build their own homes by mutually exchanging labor.
Funds may be used to pay the cost of construction supervisors who
work with families in the construction of their homes and for ad-
ministrative expenses of the organizations providing the self-help
assistance.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $25,000,000 for
Mutual and Self-Help Housing Grants.
RURAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE GRANTS
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $35,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 35,000,000
The Rural Housing Assistance Grants Program consolidates
funding for rural housing grant programs. This consolidation of
housing grant funding provides greater flexibility to tailor financial
assistance to applicant needs.
Very Low-Income Housing Repair Grants.—The Very Low-Income
Housing Repair Grants Program is authorized under section 504 of
title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171). The rural
housing repair grant program is carried out by making grants to
very low-income families to conduct necessary repairs to their
homes in order to make such dwellings safe and sanitary and to
remove hazards to the health of the occupants, their families, or
the community.
These grants may be made to cover the cost of improvements or
additions, such as repairing roofs, providing toilet facilities, pro-
viding a convenient and sanitary water supply, supplying screens,
repairing or providing structural supports, or making similar re-
pairs, additions, or improvements, including all preliminary and in-
stallation costs in obtaining central water and sewer service. A
grant can be made in combination with a section 504 very low-in-
come housing repair loan.
No assistance can be extended to any one individual in the form
of a loan, grant, or combined loans and grants in excess of
$7,500,000, and grant assistance is limited to persons or families
headed by persons who are 62 years of age or older.
Supervisory and Technical Assistance Grants.—Supervisory and
technical assistance grants are made to public and private non-
profit organizations for packaging loan applications for housing as-
sistance under sections 502, 504, 514/516, 515, and 533 of the
Housing Act of 1949 (Public Law 81–171). The assistance is di-
rected to very low-income families in underserved areas where at

93
least 20 percent of the population is below the poverty level and
at least 10 percent or more of the population resides in sub-
standard housing. In fiscal year 1994, a Homebuyer Education Pro-
gram was implemented under this authority. This program pro-
vides low-income individuals and families with education and coun-
seling on obtaining and/or maintaining occupancy of adequate
housing and supervised credit assistance to become successful
homeowners.
Compensation for Construction Defects.—Compensation for con-
struction defects provides funds for grants to eligible section 502
borrowers to correct structural defects or to pay claims of owners
arising from such defects on a newly constructed dwelling pur-
chased with RHS financial assistance. Claims are not paid until
provisions under the builder’s warranty have been fully pursued.
Requests for compensation for construction defects must be made
by the owner of the property within 18 months after the date finan-
cial assistance was granted.
Rural Housing Preservation Grants.—Rural housing preservation
grants (section 533) of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act
of 1983 (Public Law 98–181) authorizes the Rural Housing Service
to administer a program of home repair directed at low- and very
low-income people.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $35,000,000 for
the Rural Housing Assistance Grants Program.
The following table compares the grant program levels rec-
ommended by the Committee to the fiscal year 2025 levels:

RURAL COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $29,080,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 217,436,000
Community facility loans were created by the Rural Development
Act of 1972 (Public Law 92–419) to finance a variety of rural com-
munity facilities. Loans are made to organizations, including cer-
tain Indian Tribes and corporations not operated for profit and
public and quasi-public agencies, to construct, enlarge, extend, or
otherwise improve community facilities providing essential services
to rural residents. Such facilities include those providing or sup-
porting overall community development, such as fire and rescue
services, healthcare, transportation, traffic control, and community,
social, cultural, and recreational benefits. Loans are made for facili-
ties which primarily serve rural residents of open country and
rural towns and villages of not more than 20,000 people.

94
Healthcare, fire and rescue facilities, and educational facilities are
the priorities of the program and receive the majority of available
funds.
The Community Facility Grant Program authorized in the Fed-
eral Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law
104–127) is used in conjunction with the existing direct and guar-
anteed loan programs for the development of community facilities
such as hospitals, fire stations, and community centers. Grants are
targeted to the lowest income communities. Communities that have
lower population and income levels receive a higher cost-share con-
tribution through these grants with a maximum contribution of 75
percent of the cost of developing the facility.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $217,436,000 for
the Rural Community Facilities Program Account, of which
$199,436,000 is for Congressionally Direct Spending.
The following table provides the Committee’s recommendations,
as compared to the fiscal year 2025 levels:

Tribal college grants.................................................................................................. 8,000 8,000
Total, budget authority.......................................................................................... 29,080 217,436
Community Facility Guaranteed Loan Program.—The committee
encourages USDA to reduce Federal exposure to risk and expedite
the delivery of capital through the inclusion of guaranteed loans
when direct loans are offered as part of facility projects. USDA
should additionally assume that the test for credit elsewhere is sat-
isfied when the partnering guarantor sees a need for direct Federal
lending assistance consistent with existing regulatory framework, 7
CFR 1942.2(a)(1).
Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under Rural Com-
munity Facilities Program. While the Committee has provided the
funding, recipients of CDS are still required to apply for the fund-
ing. The Committee expects the agency to review the applications
and fund projects in the same manner as in previous years.
Income-based Matches.—The Committee awaits the Department’s
analysis of its methodology to calculate income-based matches for
the Community Facilities Grant program and its development of
three alternative methodologies. The Department is directed to

95
brief the Committees upon completion of this analysis. If war-
ranted, the Department is directed to make changes to its method-
ology based on this analysis.
Loan Program Appraisals.—The committee directs USDA to con-
sistently apply collateral requirements between direct and guaran-
teed loan products within rural development. This may include
business and/or going concern value to be discounted from the loan-
to-value calculations. Additionally, the USDA must consistently
apply appraisal timing requirements with an aim of reducing the
need for new appraisals during later stages of a construction
project.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee encourages RHS to allow
national organizations to participate in the Community Facilities
Technical Assistance program and to increase the grant cap to en-
sure that the technical assistance need in rural areas is met.
RURAL BUSINESS-COOPERATIVE SERVICE
The Rural Business-Cooperative Service was established by the
Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Re-
organization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354), dated October 13,
1994. Its programs were previously administered by the Rural De-
velopment Administration, the Rural Electrification Administra-
tion, and the Agricultural Cooperative Service.
RURAL BUSINESS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $31,861,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 55,575,000
The Rural Business and Industry Loan Program was created by
the Rural Development Act of 1972 (Public Law 92–419), and fi-
nances a variety of rural industrial development loans. Loans are
made for rural industrialization and rural community facilities
under Rural Development Act amendments to the Consolidated
Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1932 et seq.) authori-
ties. Business and industrial loans are made to public, private, or
cooperative organizations organized for profit; to certain Indian
tribes; or to individuals for the purpose of improving, developing,
or financing business, industry, and employment or improving the
economic and environmental climate in rural areas. Such purposes
include financing business and industrial acquisition, construction,
enlargement, repair or modernization; financing the purchase and
development of land, easements, rights-of-way, buildings, and pay-
ment of startup costs; and supplying working capital.
Rural business development grants were authorized by the Agri-
cultural Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–79) and can be made to gov-
ernmental and nonprofit entities and Indian Tribes. Up to 10 per-
cent of appropriated funds may be used to identify and analyze
business opportunities; identify, train, and provide technical assist-
ance to existing or prospective rural entrepreneurs and managers;
assist in the establishment of new rural businesses and the mainte-
nance of existing businesses; conduct economic development plan-
ning, coordination, and leadership development; and establish cen-
ters for training, technology, and trade. The balance of appro-
priated funding may be used for projects that support the develop-

96
ment of business enterprises that finance or facilitate the develop-
ment of small and emerging private business enterprise; the estab-
lishment, expansion, and operation of rural distance learning net-
works; the development of rural learning programs; and the provi-
sion of technical assistance and training to rural communities for
the purpose of improving passenger transportation.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $55,575,000 for
the Rural Business Program Account.
The following table provides the Committee’s recommendations,
as compared to the fiscal year 2025 levels:
RURAL BUSINESS PROGRAM ACCOUNT

Total, budget authority.......................................................................................... 31,861 55,575
Federal Regional Commissions and Authorities.—The Committee
recognizes that strong partnerships exist between RD and Federal
Regional Commissions and Authorities. The Committee encourages
RD to coordinate with the Regional Commissions to promote effi-
ciency during the grant planning and review process. Additionally,
the Committee encourages RD to ensure flexible processes are
available for each Regional Commission as appropriate.
High Energy Cost Grants.—The Committee directs the Rural
Utilities Service to permit the repair or replacement of bulk fuel
storage tanks under the High Energy Cost Grants program. The
Committee notes that such fuels are the only source of electricity
generation in certain rural and Native communities where energy
costs are excessively high and there is a significant deferred main-
tenance cost for Bulk Fuel in Tribal communities. The longstanding
purpose of the program is to assist families and individuals in com-
munities with extremely high per-household energy costs that are
275 percent of the National average or higher. The Committee di-
rects the Secretary to make $2,000,000 available for Indian Tribes
for the repair or replacement of bulk fuel storage tanks under the
Grants program, in addition to providing no less than fiscal year
2025 levels for the Denali Commission.
Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program.—The Com-
mittee encourages Rural Development to prioritize proposals for
the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program that support
the processing of invasive wild-caught catfish.
Rural Business Program Account.—The Committee recommends
$500,000 for transportation technical assistance.

97
The Committee directs that of the $4,000,000 recommended for
grants to benefit federally Recognized Native American Tribes,
$250,000 shall be used to implement an American Indian and Alas-
ka Native passenger transportation development and assistance
initiative. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Department
to improve information sharing about Rural Development’s busi-
ness support programs with local small business advisory organiza-
tions.
Rural Business Program Delivery.—The Rural Business Coopera-
tive Programs increase economic opportunity in rural America
through the delivery of necessary programs including the Business
and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, the Rural Business In-
vestment Program, and the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance
Program, among others. The Committee recognizes that the needs
of businesses and communities in rural America are unique and
commends Rural Development on its continued commitment to
meet the specific challenges. It is the sense of the Committee that
Rural Development remains the most well-positioned agency to ad-
minister such programs, and that RD should continue to seek
means of improving program access and effectiveness.
The Committee encourages the Department to continue collabo-
rating with the Small Business Administration as outlined in the
memorandum of understanding signed on November 20, 2023. The
Committee directs the Department, in collaboration with the SBA,
to report on the activities undertaken as a result of the memo-
randum, including opportunities to collaborate on technical assist-
ance, especially with respect to exportation and procurement.
Sustainable Aviation Fuels.—The Committee notes that sustain-
able aviation fuel [SAF] has the potential to decarbonize the avia-
tion industry by utilizing several feedstocks, such as ethanol, soy,
tallow, wood biomass, agricultural residue, and cover crops. The
cultivation of these feedstocks could provide a significant economic
opportunity in rural communities across the Nation. The Bio-
refinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufac-
turing Assistance Program, also known as the 9003 Program, has
the potential to scale up the volume of SAF by providing loans and
financial support to burgeoning enterprises in rural America.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture to
provide a report to Congress that includes 9003 program loan
metrics and if converting current loan authority into grants could
be used to accelerate and scale SAF research and development and
biorefinery construction.
Tribal Buffalo Restoration.—The Committee encourages the De-
partment to set aside a portion of the rural business development
grants to benefit federally-chartered Tribal organizations with de-
monstrable expertise in Tribal buffalo restoration efforts, for the
purchase and operation of mobile buffalo meat processing units to
support federally recognized Native American Tribes’ activities re-
lated to buffalo meat production.

INTERMEDIARY RELENDING PROGRAM FUND ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
[In thousands of dollars]
Fiscal year 2025 Committee
enacted recommendation
Estimated loan level ....................................................................................................... 10,000 13,000
Direct loan subsidy ......................................................................................................... 3,406 2,954
Administrative expenses ................................................................................................. 4,468 4,468
Total, loan subsidies and administrative expenses ......................................... 7,874 7,422
The Rural Development Intermediary Relending Loan program
was originally authorized by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964
(Public Law 88–452). The making of rural development loans by
USDA was reauthorized by the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public
Law 113–79).
Loans are made to intermediary borrowers (small investment
groups) who in turn will reloan the funds to rural businesses, com-
munity development corporations, private nonprofit organizations,
public agencies, et cetera, for the purpose of improving business,
industry, community facilities, employment opportunities, and di-
versification of the economy in rural areas.
The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 74–605) es-
tablished the program account. Appropriations to this account will
be used to cover the lifetime subsidy costs associated with the di-
rect loans obligated in 2026, as well as administrative expenses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $7,422,000 for
the Intermediary Relending Program Fund, including $4,468,000 to
be merged with salaries and expenses.
RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The Rural Economic Development Loans program was estab-
lished by the Reconciliation Act of December 1987 (Public Law
100–203), which amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7
U.S.C. 901), by establishing a new section 313. This section of the
Rural Electrification Act (7 U.S.C. 901) established a cushion of
credit payment program and created the rural economic develop-
ment subaccount. The Administrator of RUS is authorized under
the act to utilize funds in this program to provide zero interest
loans to electric and telecommunications borrowers for the purpose
of promoting rural economic development and job creation projects,
including funding for feasibility studies, startup costs, and other
reasonable expenses for the purpose of fostering rural economic de-

Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $24,600,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 24,800,000
Rural cooperative development grants are authorized under sec-
tion 310B(e) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act
(Public Law 113–79), as amended. Grants are made to fund the es-
tablishment and operation of centers for rural cooperative develop-
ment with the primary purpose of improving economic conditions
in rural areas. Grants may be made to nonprofit institutions or in-
stitutions of higher education. Grants may be used to pay up to 75
percent of the cost of the project and associated administrative
costs. The applicant must contribute at least 25 percent from non-
Federal sources, except 1994 institutions, which only need to pro-
vide 5 percent. Grants are competitive and are awarded based on
specific selection criteria.
Cooperative research agreements are authorized by 7 U.S.C.
2204b. The funds are used for cooperative research agreements,
primarily with colleges and universities, on critical operational, or-
ganizational, and structural issues facing cooperatives.
Cooperative agreements are authorized under 7 U.S.C. 2201 to
any qualified State departments of agriculture, universities, and
other State entities to conduct research that will strengthen and
enhance the operations of agricultural marketing cooperatives in
rural areas.
The Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas [ATTRA]
program was first authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985
(Public Law 99–198). The program provides information and tech-
nical assistance to agricultural producers to adopt sustainable agri-
cultural practices that are environmentally friendly and lower pro-
duction costs.

small, minority producers.
Agriculture Innovation Centers.—The Committee recommends
$1,000,000 for Agriculture Innovation Center funding, as author-
ized in section 6402 of Public Law 107–171. Prior year or current
grant awardees shall be eligible for these funds.
Value-Added Producer Grants [VAPG].—The Committee directs
that Value-Added Producer Grants be prioritized to support the
production of value-added agricultural products, including dairy
and small farms, with significant potential to expand production
and processing in the United States.
The Committee encourages USDA to promote awareness among
potential applicants of the availability of VAPG funds for eligible
projects that modify animal housing systems to comply with state
requirements, such as States that require animal products to come
from cage-free and crate-free housing systems, or facilitate the sale
of compliant products to new markets.

RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. ...........................
Committee recommendation ................................................................. ...........................
The Rural Energy for America Program is authorized under sec-
tion 9007 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002
(Public Law 107–171). This program may fund energy audits, di-

101
rect loans, loan guarantees, and grants to farmers, ranchers, and
small rural businesses for the purchase of renewable energy sys-
tems and for energy efficiency improvements.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee does not recommend a discretionary appropria-
tion for the Rural Energy for America Program, as the program has
a negative subsidy rate. The Committee recommends a loan level
of $100,000,000.
HEALTHY FOOD FINANCING INITIATIVE
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $500,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 500,000
The Healthy Food Financing Initiative is authorized under sec-
tion 4206 of the Agricultural Act of 2014. This program provides
financial and technical assistance to regional, State and local part-
nerships, and helps fund projects to improve access to fresh,
healthy foods in underserved rural areas.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $500,000 for the
Healthy Food Financing Initiative and notes the funding provided
through the American Rescue Plan Act.
RURAL UTILITIES SERVICE
The Rural Utilities Service was established under the Federal
Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganiza-
tion Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–354). RUS administers the elec-
tric and telephone programs of the former Rural Electrification Ad-
ministration and the water and waste programs of the former
Rural Development Administration.
RURAL WATER AND WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $478,487,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 443,776,000
The water and waste disposal program is authorized by sections
306, 306A, 309A, 306C, 306D, 306E, and 310B of the Consolidated
Farm and Rural Development Act (Public Law 87–128). This pro-
gram makes loans for water and waste development costs. Develop-
ment loans are made to associations, including corporations oper-
ating on a nonprofit basis, municipalities, and similar organiza-
tions generally designated as public or quasi-public agencies, that
propose projects for the development, storage, treatment, purifi-
cation, and distribution of domestic water or the collection, treat-
ment, or disposal of waste in rural areas. Such grants may not ex-
ceed 75 percent of the development cost of the projects and can
supplement other funds borrowed or furnished by applicants to pay
development costs.
The solid waste grant program is authorized under section
310B(b) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act
(Public Law 87–128). Grants are made to public entities and pri-

102
vate nonprofit organizations to provide technical assistance to local
and regional governments for the purpose of reducing or elimi-
nating pollution of water resources and for improving the planning
and management of solid waste disposal facilities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $443,776,000 for
the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program Account.
The Committee recommends $65,000,000 for water and waste
disposal systems grants for Native Americans, including Native
Alaskans, Hawaiian Homelands, and the Colonias. The Committee
recognizes the special needs and problems for delivery of basic
services to these populations and encourages the Secretary to dis-
tribute these funds in line with the fiscal year 2014 distribution to
the degree practicable. In addition, the Committee makes
$23,900,000 available for the Circuit Rider Program and directs the
Department to ensure that each State has its own staff person
dedicated to this program. The Committee commends Circuit Rid-
ers, who have provided assistance to small communities for the op-
eration of safe and clean drinking water supplies and compliance
with water regulations since 1980. The Circuit Rider Program has
long been one of USDA’s most successful public-private partner-
ships and one of the most efficient and effective use of appropriated
funds.
Black Belt Region Water Systems.—The Committee commends
the work of Rural Development on the implementation of the pilot
program to support Black Belt Region Water Systems funded in fis-
cal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. Within 90 days of enactment
of this act and quarterly thereafter, Rural Development is directed
to brief the Committee on the use of these funds.
Technical Assistance.—The Committee provides $35,000,000 for
technical assistance and directs no less than $1,000,000 to be used
to support manufactured homes.

The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (Public Law 74–605) pro-
vides the statutory authority for the electric and telecommuni-
cations programs.
The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508) es-
tablished the program account. An appropriation to this account
will be used to cover the lifetime subsidy costs associated with the
direct loans obligated and loan guarantees committed in fiscal year
2026, as well as administrative expenses.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

104
The Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program is
authorized by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act
of 1990 (Public Law 101–624), as amended by the Federal Agri-
culture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–
127). This program provides incentives to improve the quality of
phone services, provide access to advanced telecommunications
services and computer networks, and improve rural opportunities.
This program provides the facilities and equipment to link rural
education and medical facilities with more urban centers and other
facilities, providing rural residents access to better healthcare
through technology and increasing educational opportunities for
rural students. These funds are available for loans and grants.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $95,610,000 for
the Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program ac-
count, including $610,000 for congressionally directed spending.
The Committee provides $3,000,000 to address critical healthcare
needs, as authorized by section 379G of the Consolidated Farm and
Rural Development Act (Public Law 115–334).
The following table reflects the Committee’s recommendation for
the Distance Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program, as
compared to fiscal year 2025:

Congressionally Directed Spending [CDS].—The Committee has
provided CDS for certain activities and locations under Distance
Learning, Telemedicine, and Broadband Program. While the Com-
mittee has provided the funding, recipients of CDS are still re-
quired to apply for the funding. The Committee expects the agency
to review the applications and fund projects in the same manner
as in previous years.
ReConnect.—The Committee provides $35,000,000 for the ReCon-
nect pilot, which was established in the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2018 (Public Law 115–141), and again reminds USDA
that funding should not be used in areas that are already largely
served and should be focused in areas where at least 90 percent of
households lack access. In doing so, the Committee intends that
USDA should avoid efforts that could duplicate existing or planned
broadband networks, including avoiding granting funding in areas
where another provider already has received funding from another
Federal, State or local funding program to build, has otherwise
committed to a government entity to build, or has invested private

105
risk capital to build in an area and has obtained necessary permits
to do so, even if construction is not yet complete. To achieve these
goals, we urge USDA to continue coordinating closely with the Na-
tional Telecommunications Information Administration and the
Federal Communications Commission in a transparent manner to
ensure that there is a common agreement about which areas are
currently unserved, to utilize a common map to reach those conclu-
sions that is updated each time a new funding decision is an-
nounced, and to have a clear and understandable challenge process.
In addition, while the pilot is intended to be technology neutral,
it is critical that Federal broadband investments support projects
that are both scalable and adequate for both current and future
technological requirement and consumer needs. In carrying out the
Reconnect program, the Committee directs USDA to support quali-
fied projects that will provide the highest upload and download
speeds possible to ensure rural America is receiving the same qual-
ity broadband services as their non-rural counterparts.

TITLE IV
DOMESTIC FOOD PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOOD, NUTRITION, AND
CONSUMER SERVICES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $1,127,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 1,127,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Con-
sumer Services provides direction and coordination in carrying out
the laws enacted by the Congress with respect to the Department’s
nutrition assistance activities. The Office has oversight and man-
agement responsibilities for the Food and Nutrition Service [FNS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,127,000 for
the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Con-
sumer Services.
Application Process.—The Committee is concerned that the appli-
cation process for organizations which participate in both the Sum-
mer Food Service Program and the Child and Adult Care Food Pro-
gram diverts resources away from serving people in need. The
Committee directs USDA to determine ways to streamline the ap-
plication process to reduce the administrative burden to providers.
USDA is specifically directed to consider allowing organizations in
good standing for 3 years participating in both programs to file
only one application to administer both programs each year.
Communication.—The Committee is committed to supporting the
mission and values of the Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services
at the USDA, including through critical investment in nutrition
programs to support the American people. The Committee directs
the FNCS to provide quarterly briefings to the Committee, which
should commence 30 days after the enactment of this act and con-
tinue quarterly, to provide updates on key nutrition programs, in-
cluding participation.
Meals-to-You.—The Committee recognizes the benefits the Meals-
to-You [MTY] demonstration program has had in reducing food in-
security, particularly for children and youth in rural and frontier
areas who are unable to access congregate feeding sites. The Com-
mittee encourages FNS to continue providing meal delivery serv-
ices through the MTY demonstration project through a grant or co-
operative agreement to a non-profit provider that works with local
service institutions to enroll eligible low-income children.
FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE
The Food and Nutrition Service represents an organizational ef-
fort to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in this country. Nutri-
(106)

107
tion assistance programs provide access to a nutritionally adequate
diet for low-income individuals and families and encourage better
eating patterns among the Nation’s children. These programs in-
clude:
Child Nutrition Programs [CNP].—The National School Lunch
and School Breakfast, Summer Food Service, and Child and Adult
Care Food programs provide funding to the States, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam for use in serving nu-
tritious lunches and breakfasts to children attending schools of
high school grades and under, to children of preschool age in child
care centers, and to children in other institutions in order to im-
prove the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and broad-
en the markets for agricultural food commodities. Through the Spe-
cial Milk Program, assistance is provided to the States for making
reimbursement payments to eligible schools and child care institu-
tions which institute or expand milk service in order to increase
the consumption of fluid milk by children. Funds for this program
are provided by direct appropriation and transfer from section 32.
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
and Children [WIC].—This program safeguards the health of preg-
nant, postpartum, and breast-feeding women, and infants and chil-
dren up to age five who are at nutritional risk because of inad-
equate nutrition and income by providing supplemental foods. The
delivery of supplemental foods may be done through health clinics,
vouchers redeemable at retail food stores, or other approved meth-
ods which a cooperating State health agency may select. Funds for
this program are provided by direct appropriation.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP].—This pro-
gram seeks to improve nutritional standards of needy persons and
families. Assistance is provided to eligible households to enable
them to obtain a better diet by increasing their food purchasing ca-
pability, usually by furnishing benefits in the form of electronic ac-
cess to funds. The program includes Nutrition Assistance to Puerto
Rico [NAP]. The program also includes the Food Distribution Pro-
gram on Indian Reservations [FDPIR], which provides nutritious
agricultural commodities to low-income persons living on or near
Indian reservations who choose not to participate in SNAP.
Commodity Assistance Program [CAP].—This program provides
funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program [CSFP],
the Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program [FMNP], Disaster Assist-
ance, Pacific Island Assistance, and administrative expenses for the
Emergency Food Assistance Program [TEFAP]. CSFP provides sup-
plemental foods to low-income elderly persons age 60 and over.
TEFAP provides commodities and grant funds to State agencies to
assist in the cost of storage and distribution of donated commod-
ities. Nutritious agricultural commodities are provided to residents
of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.
Cash assistance is provided to distributing agencies to assist them
in meeting administrative expenses incurred. CAP also provides
funding for use in non-presidentially declared disasters and for
FNS’s administrative costs in connection with relief for all disas-
ters. Funds for this program are provided by direct appropriation.
Nutrition Programs Administration.—Most salaries and Federal
operating expenses of FNS are funded from this account. Also in-

108
cluded is the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which
oversees improvements in and revisions to the food guidance sys-
tems and serves as the focal point for advancing and coordinating
nutrition promotion and education policy to improve the health of
all Americans.
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $33,266,226,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 36,285,902,000
Child Nutrition Programs, authorized by the Richard B. Russell
National School Lunch Act (Public Law 79–396) and the Child Nu-
trition Act of 1966 (Public Law 89–642), provide Federal assistance
to State agencies in the form of cash and commodities for use in
preparing and serving nutritious meals to children while they are
attending school, residing in service institutions, or participating in
other organized activities away from home. The purpose of these
programs is to help maintain the health and proper physical devel-
opment of America’s children. Milk is provided to children either
free or at a low cost, depending on their family income level. FNS
provides cash subsidies to States for administering the programs
and directly administers the program in the States which choose
not to do so. Grants are also made for nutritional training and sur-
veys and for State administrative expenses. Under current law,
most of these payments are made on the basis of reimbursement
rates established by law and applied to lunches and breakfasts ac-
tually served by the States. The reimbursement rates are adjusted
annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for food
away from home.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends $36,285,902,000 for the Child Nutri-
tion Programs.
The Committee’s recommendation provides for the following an-
nual rates for the child nutrition programs.

The Committee expects FNS to utilize the National Food Service
Management Institute to carry out the food safety education pro-
gram.
Costs of Producing School Meals in Outlying Areas.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges that USDA provided a temporary increase in
the National average payment rate for the outlying areas at a rate
equal to the National average payment rate for Alaska until the
School Nutrition Cost Study II is completed and updated adjust-
ments for school meal reimbursements for these areas are subse-
quently made, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1760(f). The Committee di-
rects USDA to provide technical assistance and flexibility to school
food authorities and school staff in the outlying areas to ensure the
collection of complete and accurate data for the School Nutrition
Cost Study II.
Crediting System.—The Committee recognizes that the current
crediting system used by FNS in administering the School Lunch
Program and the School Breakfast Program has not been updated
to keep pace with products in the marketplace. Specifically, Greek
yogurt receives the same protein crediting as other products with
less protein. The Committee directs the Secretary to update the
system of crediting high-protein yogurt to accurately reflect sci-
entifically demonstrated higher protein content in strained yogurt.
Farm to School Program.—Successful implementation of Farm to
School programs requires broad-based knowledge of best practices
regarding coordination among farmers, processors, distributors,
students, teachers, dietary and food preparation staff, and USDA
professionals. Since the scope of some Farm to School projects has
expanded in recent years, the Committee has included language to
allow maximum grant amounts to increase to $500,000.
Local School Wellness Policies.—The Committee acknowledges
that difficulty accessing a variety of foods can cause significant
issues, including poor physical health and eating disorders. The
Committee directs the Secretary to update local school wellness
policy guidance to incorporate eating disorder prevention and edu-
cation into the existing local school wellness policy framework. The
Committee requests a report within 120 days of the enactment of
this act on the agency’s progress to update State Education Agen-
cies on the inclusion of eating disorders education and prevention
within Local School Wellness Policies.
Pulse Crops.—The Committee recognizes the nutritional value of
pulse crops for children and encourages FNS to support school food
authorities in sourcing and serving pulse crops.
Seafood Consumption in the National School Lunch Program.—
The Committee directs the department, in coordination with

110
NOAA, to address factors limiting seafood consumption in school
per the recommendations in GAO report ‘‘National School Lunch
Program: USDA Could Enhance Assistance to States and Schools
in Providing Seafood to Students’’ (GAO–23–105179).
Non-Congregate Meals.—The Committee recognizes that the Na-
tional School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program served
healthy meals to over 44 million students in fiscal year 2024. The
Committee also recognizes that access to such meals is critically
important to the physical and behavioral health of pre-K–12 stu-
dents and to their academic performance in school. The Committee
supports the Food and Nutrition Service [FNS] and its efforts to
provide daily free and reduced cost meals to millions of food inse-
cure students. The Committee is concerned that access to such
meals is not available to all full-time public school students and en-
courages the FNS to allow States the flexibility to explore innova-
tive solutions (e.g., EBT cards) to reach all income-eligible students
enrolled in public schools regardless of learning modality. The
Committee directs FNS to expand access to non-congregate meal
programs for students who do not have access to such benefits in
a congregate setting and are otherwise eligible for free and reduced
cost meals under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act
and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.
Summer Food Service Program.—The Committee supports the
FNS’ proposed implementation of summer meal programs as part
of its December 2023 interim final rule in response to Congress’s
direction in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. The Com-
mittee appreciates the interim final rule’s recognition that the nu-
tritional needs of children in the summer cannot be addressed
through a one-size-fits-all approach, and States should include the
use of non-congregate meal programs where necessary. To ensure
States have the resources needed to properly implement the rule,
the Committee encourages USDA to set aside funding to provide
technical assistance for up to five States interested in imple-
menting non-congregate meal delivery options for children and
families in rural areas. The Committee encourages USDA to
prioritize this funding for States interested in partnering with a
non-profit entity that has experience in implementing meal deliv-
ery options in rural areas and to uphold program integrity as re-
quired in the interim final rule.
Whole Grains.—The Committee encourages USDA to continue to
support the inclusion of nutrient-dense whole grain foods in child
nutrition and feeding programs and nutrition guidance. The De-
partment should recognize the importance of nutrient-dense whole
grains in the American diet and the economic importance to the ag-
ricultural economy.
SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS,
AND CHILDREN [WIC]
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $7,597,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 8,200,000,000
The WIC program is authorized by section 17 of the Child Nutri-
tion Act of 1966. Its purpose is to safeguard the health of pregnant,
breast-feeding, and postpartum women and infants and children up

111
to age five who are at nutritional risk because of inadequate nutri-
tion and inadequate income.
The WIC program food packages are designed to provide foods
which studies have demonstrated are lacking in the diets of the
WIC program target population. The authorized supplemental
foods are iron-fortified breakfast cereal, fruit or vegetable juice
which contains vitamin C, dry beans, peas, and peanut butter.
There are three general types of delivery systems for WIC foods:
(1) retail purchase in which participants obtain supplemental foods
through retail stores; (2) home delivery systems in which food is
delivered to the participant’s home; and (3) direct distribution sys-
tems in which participants pick up food from a distribution outlet.
The food is free of charge to all participants.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $8,200,000,000
for the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants,
and Children. The Committee recommendation fully funds esti-
mated WIC participation in fiscal year 2026. The Committee pro-
vides no less than $90,000,000 for breastfeeding support initiatives
and $14,000,000 for infrastructure.
Allergenic Foods.—The Committee recognizes that section 17 of
the Child Nutrition Act (42 U.S.C. 1786(c)(11)(C)) directs the Sec-
retary to conduct a scientific review of the WIC food packages no
fewer than every 10 years, and that the next scientific review is set
to be released in 2027. Given the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans recommendation of early introduction of potentially al-
lergenic foods to infants, especially peanuts and egg, to prevent al-
lergies later in life, the Committee directs the Secretary to include
a review and recommendations for the early introduction of food al-
lergens in the upcoming review of the WIC infant food packages.
Dairy Allowance in the WIC Food Package.—The Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans [DGA] have identified dairy products as nutri-
ent-dense while also noting that a high percentage of the U.S. pop-
ulation, including WIC’s at-risk population, are not consuming the
recommended level of dairy. The Committee remains concerned
about the reduction of the maximum monthly allowance with re-
spect to milk in the April 18, 2024, final rule, ‘‘Revisions to the
WIC Food Packages’’, and encourages the Secretary to allow state
WIC directors to return to or continue the previous recommended
levels of dairy in the WIC program that were in place on April 17,
2024.
Infant Formula.—The Committee is concerned that Infant For-
mula Rebates for the WIC Program have become less generous
since the 2022 Infant Formula Crisis. The Committee is concerned
that this has resulted in participants having less support to pur-
chase other food with WIC. The Committee directs the Food and
Nutrition Service to provide a report within 90 days of the enact-
ment of this act, that outlines the changes in Infant Formula Re-
bates since fiscal year 2022, and recommendations so that Infant
Formula Rebates continue to meet the needs of the WIC program.
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Recommendations.—WIC des-
ignated Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome [NAS] as a nutrition risk
factor in 2017, and WIC agencies across the country actively screen

112
for symptoms of substance use, referring mothers who may be
struggling with substance use disorder to appropriate services. The
Committee encourages USDA to collaborate with the Department
of Health and Human Services on the development of uniform, evi-
dence-based nutrition education materials in order to best serve
WIC-eligible pregnant women and caregivers to infants impacted
by NAS. Uniform materials will enhance WIC’s ongoing efforts to
screen and support infants exhibiting symptoms of NAS.
Yogurt Fortification.—The Committee recognizes that the final
rule entitled ‘‘Revisions in the WIC Food Packages’’ is requiring vi-
tamin D fortification of yogurt to address shortfalls. The Committee
understands that a majority of yogurts in the marketplace do not
contain vitamin D fortification and that manufacturers require ad-
ditional time to reformulate and relabel products to meet such re-
quirements. The Committee encourages the Secretary to extend the
compliance date in the final rule requiring vitamin D fortification
of yogurts for an additional 36 months.
SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 .............................................................................$122,382,521,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 118,139,341,000
SNAP attempts to alleviate hunger and malnutrition among low-
income persons by increasing their food purchasing power. Eligible
households receive SNAP benefits with which they can purchase
food through regular retail stores.
Other programs funded through SNAP include Nutrition Assist-
ance to Puerto Rico and American Samoa, the Food Distribution
Program on Indian Reservations, the Emergency Food Assistance
Program, and the Community Food Projects program.
SNAP is currently in operation in all 50 States, the District of
Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. Participating households
receive food benefits, the value of which is determined by house-
hold size and income. The cost of the benefits is paid by the Fed-
eral Government. As required by law, FNS annually revises house-
hold benefit allotments to reflect changes in the cost of the thrifty
food plan.
Administrative Costs.—All direct and indirect administrative
costs incurred for certification of households, issuance of benefits,
quality control, outreach, and fair hearing efforts are shared by the
Federal Government and the States on a 50–50 basis.
State Antifraud Activities.—Under the provisions of the Food and
Nutrition Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–246), States are eligible to
be reimbursed for 50 percent of the costs of their fraud investiga-
tions and prosecutions.
States are required to implement an employment and training
program for the purpose of assisting members of households par-
ticipating in SNAP in gaining skills, training, or experience that
will increase their ability to obtain regular employment. USDA has
implemented a grant program to States to assist them in providing
employment and training services.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends $118,139,341,000 for the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program. Of the amount rec-
ommended, $3,000,000,000 is made available as a contingency re-
serve.

Disaster SNAP.—The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination
with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, shall coordinate food benefit allotments under section 412
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act (42 U.S.C. 5179) and section 5(h) of the Food and Nutrition Act
of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2014(h)) with respect to individuals and house-
holds adversely affected by a major disaster to minimize delays in
receiving temporary food assistance, improve information sharing,
and prevent redundancy of assistance.
FDPIR Pilot Program.—The Committee is concerned that FNS
has prohibited tribes and Tribal organizations that participate in
the FDPIR pilot program from including traditional food items un-
less such items replace a USDA-provided item, and prohibited such
substitutions unless the producer of the traditional food is able to
provide sufficient quantities for all FDPIR participants nationwide.
Allowing tribes participating in the pilot to source new traditional
foods from small, indigenous producers without requiring a substi-
tution will result in the inclusion of more traditional foods and help
small, indigenous producers to expand. The Committee therefore
directs FNS to allow tribes participating in the pilot program to in-
clude traditional foods without substitutions and to allow partici-
pating tribes to purchase traditional foods from producers that may

114
not be able to provide sufficient quantities to serve all participating
tribes across the Nation.
Hot Foods.—The Committee directs the Secretary to study the
impact of allowing hot foods to be purchased with SNAP benefits
at different types of SNAP retail food stores, including retail food
stores with co-located entities.
National Accuracy Clearinghouse.—The Committee supports the
full implementation of the National Accuracy Clearinghouse [NAC]
that uses a third-party electronic data matching system, data ana-
lytics, and public data to determine the correct state to issue SNAP
benefits. The Committee encourages FNS to expand NAC to all
SNAP agencies. In addition, the Committee reiterates that States
must administer a robust appeals process to ensure individuals are
not automatically removed from receiving benefits.
Online Purchasing Pilot.—The Committee is encouraged by
USDA’s successful implementation of SNAP Online Purchasing
Pilot. The Pilot, as directed in the last two Farm Bills, has proven
to be successful and was expanded nationwide during the pan-
demic. The Committee encourages USDA’s further work in this
area as it benefits recipients in rural and hard to reach areas or
those with limited mobility.
Skimming.—The Committee understands USDA’s efforts to sup-
port States in efforts to make whole SNAP recipients after they are
victims of skimming. The Committee recognizes that authority for
States to repay skimming victims expires on September 30, 2025.
No later than 30 days after enactment of this act, the Committee
directs USDA to provide a report on progress toward making skim-
ming victims whole.
SNAP Fraud.—The Committee remains concerned about data
discrepancies that allowed retailers to provide benefits to individ-
uals using fraudulent credentials, as outlined in a January 2017
OIG report. The Committee encourages FNS, as part of their work
to implement controls to address these problems, to consider how
advanced analytics is used to improve analysis across multiple sys-
tems mentioned in the report. This could include integrating data
mining and machine learning into source systems such as STARS
and ALERT, applying computer vision to enhance FNS investiga-
tions, and deploying new predictive analytics to help detect emerg-
ing fraud schemes. The Committee requests USDA to continue to
update Congress on its progress in addressing the issues outlined
in the report.
SNAP Payment Errors.—The Committee is concerned about con-
tinued payment error rates in the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program. The Committee encourages the Secretary of Agri-
culture to work with governors and administrators to address the
root causes of errors and ensure benefits are available to those in
need. This approach should prioritize deploying effective incentives
for States to reduce their error rates, to include technical assist-
ance and promoting best practices for use of technology and per-
sonnel to improve administrative processes.
SNAP Pilot.—The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a
report, within 180 days of enactment, to the Committee, compiled
in consultation with stakeholders and the appropriate State and
Federal officials, describing how any waiver or pilot program will

115
improve SNAP participant experience. The report shall include the
approximate cost, to include the administration, of the implementa-
tion of and SNAP authorized retailer compliance with any waiver
or pilot program. The report shall also include an explanation of
how the Department will communicate to States and SNAP author-
ized retailers which foods are SNAP eligible and ensure retailers
can implement and comply with food restriction requirements in
their point-of-sale [POS] systems and ongoing technical support.
Thrifty Food Plan.—The Committee is concerned that USDA’s
Thrifty Food Plan adjustment for Hawaii omits the price of food in
rural and remote regions of the state. The Committee directs
USDA to finalize the proposed rule published at 2024–27853 (89
FR 95724) to update 7 CFR 273.10(e)(4) to include the price of food
throughout the state of Hawaii.
COMMODITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $516,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 516,000,000
The Commodity Assistance Program includes funding for the
Commodity Supplemental Food Program and funding to pay ex-
penses associated with the storage and distribution of commodities
through The Emergency Food Assistance Program.
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program.—Authorized by
section 4(a) of the Agricultural and Consumer Protection Act of
1973 (7 U.S.C. 612c note), as amended in 1981 by Public Law 97–
98 and in 2014 by Public Law 113–79, this program provides sup-
plemental food to low-income senior citizens and, in some cases,
low-income infants and children up to age six and low-income preg-
nant and postpartum women. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public
Law 113–79) discontinued the admission of new pregnant and
postpartum women and children into the program. Those already
in the program can continue to receive assistance until they are no
longer eligible.
The foods for CSFP are provided by USDA for distribution
through State agencies. The authorized commodities include iron-
fortified infant formula, rice cereal, cheese, canned juice, evapo-
rated milk and/or nonfat dry milk, canned vegetables or fruits,
canned meat or poultry, egg mix, dehydrated potatoes, farina, pea-
nut butter, and dry beans. Elderly participants may receive all
commodities except iron-fortified infant formula and rice cereal.
The Emergency Food Assistance Program.—Authorized by the
Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.), as
amended, the program provides nutrition assistance to low-income
people through prepared meals served on site and through the dis-
tribution of commodities to low-income households for home con-
sumption. The commodities are provided by USDA to State agen-
cies for distribution through State-established networks. State
agencies make the commodities available to local organizations,
such as soup kitchens, food pantries, food banks, and community
action agencies, for their use in providing nutrition assistance to
those in need.
Funds are administered by FNS through grants to State agencies
which operate commodity distribution programs. Allocation of the
funds to States is based on a formula which considers the States’

116
unemployment rate and the number of persons with income below
the poverty level.
Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.—The Farmers’ Market Nu-
trition Program provides WIC or WIC-eligible participants with
coupons to purchase fresh, nutritious, unprepared foods, such as
fruits and vegetables, from farmers’ markets. This benefits both
participants and local farmers by increasing the awareness and use
of farmers’ markets by low-income households.
Pacific Island and Disaster Assistance.—This program provides
funding for assistance to the nuclear-affected islands in the form of
commodities and administrative funds. It also provides funding for
use in non-presidentially declared disasters and for FNS’s adminis-
trative costs in connection with relief for all disasters.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $516,070,000 for
the Commodity Assistance Program. The Committee continues to
encourage the Department to distribute Commodity Assistance Pro-
gram funds equitably among the States, based on an assessment
of the needs and priorities of each State and the State’s preference
to receive commodity allocations through each of the programs
funded under this account.
Commodity Supplemental Food Program.—The Committee rec-
ommends $425,000 for CSFP. The Committee is concerned about
barriers eligible Commodity Supplemental Food Program appli-
cants, including those residing in smaller and more rural commu-
nities, face in participating in the program. The Committee directs
the Secretary to submit a report to study barriers to program par-
ticipation and strategies that States have utilized to increase CSFP
participation rates. The Committee also requests that USDA pub-
lish an update to guidance document FNS–GD–2020–0078 reit-
erating that current CSFP program flexibilities give State and local
agencies discretion to allow for home delivery, including con-
tracting with third-party delivery.
Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.—The Committee is aware
that FMNP provides fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income
mothers and children, benefiting not only WIC participants, but
local farmers as well. Therefore, the Committee recommends
$10,000 for FMNP and directs the Secretary to obligate these funds
within 45 days of enactment of this act.
The Emergency Food Assistance Program.—The Committee pro-
vides $80,000 in discretionary funding for TEFAP transportation,
storage, and program integrity. In addition, the Committee rec-
ommendation grants the Secretary authority to transfer up to an
additional 20 percent from TEFAP commodities for this purpose
and urges the Secretary to use this authority.
The Committee encourages the Secretary to identify opportuni-
ties for increasing the supply of TEFAP commodities in the coming
fiscal year through bonus and specialty crop purchases. The De-
partment shall make available to the States domestically produced
catfish fillets for distribution to local agencies.
TEFAP Local Foods Pilot.—The Committee directs FNS to con-
duct a pilot program to provide funds for States to purchase locally-
grown priority agricultural products-including fruits, vegetables,

117
dairy, meats, seafood, grains, poultry, or other commodity food
products-sourced from small and underserved producers to be dis-
tributed to low-income households through emergency feeding orga-
nizations. In piloting the program, the Committee encourages FNS
to select States that work with emergency feeding organizations to
serve geographically-isolated, food import-dependent areas. The
Committee directs FNS to submit a report to Congress following
the conclusion of the pilot to assess project effectiveness in pro-
viding nutritious and culturally-relevant food to individuals in
need, improving agricultural supply chain resiliency, and expand-
ing economic opportunity for small and underserved local agricul-
tural producers.
TEFAP Resources.—The Committee notes record demand for the
charitable food network, placing great strain on food banks
throughout the United States. The Committee encourages the Sec-
retary of Agriculture to use all available authorities, including Sec-
tion 32 of the Agriculture Act of 1935, to purchase fresh seafood,
fruits, vegetables, and other foods from domestic producers to sup-
port domestic commodity markets and to distribute to food banks
and other emergency feeding organizations across the country. To
provide a needs assessment to Congress, the Secretary should in-
clude in its next budget justification, an analysis of the food, fuel,
storage and other costs associated with distributing USDA food to
communities and the increased TEFAP administrative funding
needed to address rising food distribution costs. The analysis shall
include an evaluation of the additional administrative expenses re-
quired to serve rural and remote communities.
Wild Game.—The Committee recognizes that The Emergency
Food Assistance Program and the ‘‘Farm to Food Bank Projects’’ al-
lows for the use of funds for the repackaging and processing of do-
nated wild game. The ‘‘Farm to Food Bank Projects’’ also allow
funds to be used for wild game. The Committee encourages the De-
partment to educate and publicize to State agencies on these inno-
vative and sustainable program to provide nutrition assistance to
low-income Americans.
NUTRITION PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $177,348,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 177,348,000
The Nutrition Programs Administration appropriation provides
for most of the Federal operating expenses of FNS, which includes
CNP, the Special Milk Program, WIC, SNAP, NAP, and CAP.
The major objective of Nutrition Programs Administration is to
efficiently and effectively carry out the nutrition assistance pro-
grams mandated by law. This is to be accomplished by the fol-
lowing: (1) giving clear and consistent guidance and supervision to
State agencies and other cooperators; (2) assisting the States and
other cooperators by providing program, managerial, financial, and
other advice and expertise; (3) measuring, reviewing, and analyzing
the progress being made toward achieving program objectives; and
(4) carrying out regular staff support functions.

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $177,348,000 for
Nutrition Programs Administration.

TITLE V
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND RELATED PROGRAMS
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR TRADE AND FOREIGN
AGRICULTURAL AFFAIR
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $932,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 932,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricul-
tural Affairs provides direction and coordination in carrying out the
laws enacted by the Congress with respect to the Department’s
international affairs (except for foreign economic development). The
Office has oversight and management responsibilities for the For-
eign Agricultural Service [FAS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $932,000 for the
Office of the Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural
Affairs.
Food Chain Systems.—The Committee is aware that the lack of
comprehensive cold food chain systems is one of the main causes
of food loss and results in a significant percentage of food spoilage
from farm-to-market. Preventing food loss and implementing a ro-
bust cold food chain results in substantial benefits such as in-
creased nutrition, a safer food supply, greater economic oppor-
tunity, and increased resilience. In order to maximize the benefit
investment in the agricultural productivity of the developing world,
the Committee encourages the Department to give strong consider-
ation to the use of cold chain technologies and include the develop-
ment of appropriate cooling technologies in programs, policies, and
strategic plans aimed at hunger prevention and food security in de-
veloping agricultural markets.
Improvements and Efficiencies.—The Food for Peace program
supports American farmers by purchasing U.S.-grown commodities
to distribute as aid to developing nations, promoting food security
and providing market opportunities for farmers. The McGovern-
Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Pro-
gram provides American agricultural commodities to help feed chil-
dren and support school meals in other countries. This program
benefits both the recipients in need and American farmers by cre-
ating demand for U.S. agricultural products. The Committee is con-
cerned by delays affecting both programs. Within 60 days of the en-
actment of this Act, the Committee directs USDA, in coordination
with the Department of State where appropriate, to brief the Com-
mittee on the status of both programs, including any proposed im-
provements and opportunities for efficiencies for the Committee to
consider. The Committee is committed to working with stake-
(119)

120
holders and the Administration to ensure that these longstanding
programs support American farmers while working to eliminate
hunger and malnutrition abroad.
International Agricultural Education Fellowship Program
[IAEFP].—The Committee urges USDA to prioritize IAEFP grants
to multi-year programs or to continue existing programs, including
programs previously awarded IAEFP funds. Further, the Com-
mittee is concerned about regional limitations on eligible programs
in previous funding opportunities and encourages USDA to avoid
limiting eligibility of applicants to specific countries or regions.
Market Access Program [MAP] and Foreign Market Development
Program [FMD] Reporting.—The Committee directs the Depart-
ment to publish an annual report describing the recipients of
funds, including the quantity and specific uses of such funding
awards, granted through MAP and FMD for the purpose of pro-
moting agricultural sales in Cuba, to ensure compliance with Sec.
3201 of Public Law 115–334.
Peanut Exports.—The Committee remains concerned with per-
sistent non-tariff trade barriers faced by the domestic peanut in-
dustry when attempting to export peanuts to the European Union.
The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize inter-
agency coordination with the Office of the United States Trade
Representative and industry engagement in order to develop effec-
tive and lasting solutions that will allow increased market access
for domestic peanuts into the European Union.
Pecan Exports.—The Committee directs the Department to
prioritize interagency coordination and industry engagement to de-
velop effective strategies to allow for increased market access of do-
mestic pecans into India.
Reimbursements.—The Committee is concerned by the adminis-
tration’s delays in providing reimbursements for activities pre-
viously performed to partners in the distribution of foreign food as-
sistance. The Secretary is directed to consult with the Secretary of
State on ways to best improve timeliness within the reimburse-
ment process and improve the agency’s payments system to elimi-
nate delays in the future. The Secretary is further required to pro-
vide a report to the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this
act on progress related to this directive.

recommendation................................................................................... 227,330 6,063 233,393
The Foreign Agricultural Service was established March 10,
1953, by Secretary’s Memorandum No. 1320, supplement 1. Public
Law 83–690, approved August 28, 1954, transferred the agricul-
tural attache´s from the Department of State to FAS.
The mission of FAS overseas is to represent U.S. agricultural in-
terests, promote export of domestic farm products, improve world
trade conditions, and report on agricultural production and trade
in foreign countries. FAS staff are stationed at 98 offices around
the world, where they provide expertise in agricultural economics
and marketing, as well as attache´ services.
FAS carries out several export assistance programs to counter
the adverse effects of unfair trade practices by competitors on U.S.
agricultural trade. The Market Access Program [MAP] conducts
both generic and brand-identified promotional programs in conjunc-
tion with nonprofit agricultural associations and private firms fi-
nanced through reimbursable CCC payments.
The General Sales Manager was established pursuant to section
5(f) of the charter of the Commodity Credit Corporation and 15
U.S.C. 714–714p. The funds allocated to the General Sales Man-
ager are used for conducting the following programs: (1) CCC Ex-
port Credit Guarantee Program (GSM–102), including facilities fi-
nancing guarantees; (2) Food for Peace; (3) section 416b Overseas
Donations Program; (4) Market Access Program; and (5) programs
authorized by the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (Pub-
lic Law 87–155) including barter, export sales of most CCC-owned
commodities, export payments, and other programs as assigned to
encourage and enhance the export of U.S. agricultural commodities.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends $227,330 for the Foreign Agricul-
tural Service.
Borlaug Fellows Program.—The Committee provides no less than
$4,000,000 for the Borlaug International Agricultural Science and
Technology Fellows Program. This program provides training for
international scientists and policymakers from selected developing
countries. The fellows work closely with U.S. specialists in their
fields of expertise and apply that knowledge in their home coun-
tries. The Committee recognizes the importance of this program in
helping developing countries strengthen their agricultural practices
and food security.
Cochran Fellowship Program.—The Committee provides no less
than $5,000,000 for the Cochran Fellowship Program. The Com-

122
mittee encourages the Secretary to continue to provide additional
support for the program through the CCC Emerging Markets Pro-
gram.
Disparate Effect of Hunger on Women and Girls.—The Com-
mittee acknowledges the disparate impact of hunger on women and
girls and the fact of the 333 million people who are severely hungry
in the world right now, nearly 60 percent are women and girls.
Furthermore, it is recognized that women are more likely than men
to report food insecurity in almost 2/3 of countries and are more
likely to suffer health conditions due to lack of nutrition, such as
anemia. The Committee, therefore, encourages the Secretary to
make women and girls a priority in the Food for Peace Title II pro-
gram as they often eat last and least while sacrificing for their
families.
Food for Peace.—For over 70 years the Food for Peace program
has fed millions across the world and been a stabilizing force for
good in struggling countries. Not only does the program feed vul-
nerable populations, it helps sustain the U.S. agriculture commu-
nity by requiring only U.S. grown commodities be used in the pro-
gram. The world is seeing unprecedented hunger in many areas of
the world and the Committee does not believe now is the time to
under fund this vital program.
Quarterly Reports.—The Secretary is directed, in consultation
with the Secretary of State , to provide to the Committee a quar-
terly report on obligations and current balances of Food for Peace
Title II grants. This report should also include any supplemental
funding.

Commodities Supplied in Connection With Dispositions Abroad
(Title II) (7 U.S.C. 1721–1726).—Commodities are supplied without
cost through foreign governments to combat malnutrition and to
meet famine and other emergency requirements. Commodities are
also supplied for non-emergencies through public and private agen-
cies, including intergovernmental organizations. The CCC pays
ocean freight on shipments under this title and may also pay over-
land transportation costs to a landlocked country, as well as inter-
nal distribution costs in emergency situations. The funds appro-
priated for title II are made available to private voluntary organi-
zations and cooperatives to assist these organizations in meeting
administrative and related costs.
Food for Peace Interagency Review and Report.—The Committee
provides $1,000,000 and directs the Foreign Agricultural Service
[FAS] within the Department of Agriculture [USDA] to work with
the U.S. Agency for International Development [USAID] on an
interagency review and report to Congress that outlines the process
and needs within the USDA to operate the Food for Peace program
should Congress direct such a transfer of administration from
USAID to USDA. For the past 70 years, American farmers have
helped combat international hunger through Food for Peace, feed-
ing more than 4 billion people in more than 150 countries. Regard-
less of which agency manages such program, the Committee sup-

123
ports efforts to improve administrative efficiencies, transparency,
and integration of American farmers within the program. The Com-
mittee recognizes additional capacity at the USDA may be needed
to support a seamless transition between agencies should Congress
transfers the program administration. The Committee requests a
report within 60 days of enactment of this legislation addressing
the agency’s capacity needs pre- and post-relocation, such as space
requirements, IT infrastructure, and staffing levels and staff exper-
tise, ensuring the relocation supports efficient operations, as well
as a comparison to the operation of the program at USAID in fiscal
year 2024. Specifically, the Committee directs that the report in-
clude:
—Justification for Relocation.—The rationale behind the move,
such as cost savings, attracting and retaining talent, or im-
proving operational efficiency.
—Cost Analysis.—A comprehensive cost analysis will be included,
detailing expenses associated with the relocation, including fa-
cility costs, moving expenses, and any potential impact on em-
ployee compensation or benefits.
—Impact on Agency Operations.—How the relocation will affect
the agency’s day-to-day operations, including any potential dis-
ruptions, changes in work processes, or impacts on service de-
livery.
—Space Requirements.—The space requirements of the new loca-
tion, including square footage, office configurations, and any
specialized needs.
—IT Infrastructure.—The IT infrastructure needs of the new lo-
cation, including network capacity, server requirements, and
data security.
—Staffing Levels and Transfer of Staff Expertise.—The report
will address how the relocation might affect staffing levels, in-
cluding any potential for downsizing, hiring, or re-allocating
personnel with program expertise and must include a discus-
sion of the staffing expertise that will need to be transferred
from the United States Agency for International Development
to the Department of Agriculture.
—Employee Support.—The support provided to employees during
the relocation process, such as relocation assistance, training,
and communication initiatives.
—Operational Planning.—Protocols and an operations plan for
management of and participation with humanitarian responses
operations, including for Disaster Assistance Response Teams,
between USAID, State, and USDA.

The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child
Nutrition Program helps support education, child development, and
food security for some of the world’s poorest children. The program
provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as fi-
nancial and technical assistance, for school feeding and maternal
and child nutrition projects in low-income, food-deficit countries
that are committed to universal education. Commodities made
available for donation through agreements with private voluntary
organizations, cooperatives, intergovernmental organizations, and
foreign governments may be donated for direct feeding or for local
sale to generate proceeds to support school feeding and nutrition
projects.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $240,000,000 for
the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nu-
trition Program.
Local and Regional Procurement.—The Committee supports ef-
forts to build long-term agriculture sustainability and establish a
local investment in school feeding programs. With direct U.S. com-
modity contributions, projects supported by the McGovern-Dole
Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program have significantly
improved the attendance, nourishment, and learning capacity of
school-aged children in low-income countries throughout the impov-
erished world. New funding authorities would enable school feeding
programs to proactively transition from direct commodity assist-
ance to locally sourced agriculture products. The Committee directs
the Secretary to conduct the Local and Regional Food Aid Procure-
ment Project Program in accordance with the priorities of the
McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutri-
tion Program.

In 1980, the CCC instituted the Export Credit Guarantee Pro-
gram (GSM–102) under its charter authority. With this program,
CCC guarantees, for a fee, payments due U.S. exporters under de-
ferred payment sales contracts (up to 36 months) for defaults due
to commercial as well as noncommercial risks. The risk to CCC ex-
tends from the date of export to the end of the deferred payment
period covered in the export sales contract and covers only that
portion of the payments agreed to in the assurance agreement. Op-
eration of this program is based on criteria which will assure that
it is used only where it is determined that it will develop new mar-
ket opportunities and maintain and expand existing world markets
for U.S. agricultural commodities. The program encourages U.S. fi-

125
nancial institutions to provide financing to those areas where the
institutions would be unwilling to provide financing in the absence
of the CCC guarantees. CCC also provides facilities financing guar-
antees.
The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508) es-
tablishes the program account. The subsidy costs of the CCC export
guarantee programs are exempt from the requirement of advance
appropriations of budget authority according to section 504(c)(2) of
the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508). Ap-
propriations to this account will be used for administrative ex-
penses.

The Food and Drug Administration [FDA] is a scientific regu-
latory agency whose mission is to promote and protect the public
health and safety of Americans. The FDA’s work is a blend of
science and law. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments
Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–85) reaffirmed the responsibilities of
the FDA: to ensure safe and effective products reach the market in
a timely way and to monitor products for continued safety while
they are in use. In addition, the FDA is entrusted with two critical
functions in the Nation’s war on terrorism: preventing willful con-
tamination of all regulated products, including food; and improving
(126)

127
the availability of medications to prevent or treat injuries caused
by biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents.
The FDA Foods program has the primary responsibility for as-
suring that the food supply, quality of foods, food ingredients, and
dietary supplements are safe, sanitary, nutritious, wholesome, and
honestly labeled and that cosmetic products are safe and properly
labeled. The variety and complexity of the food supply has grown
dramatically while new and more complex safety issues, such as
emerging microbial pathogens, natural toxins, and technological in-
novations in production and processing, have developed. This pro-
gram plays a major role in keeping the U.S. food supply among the
safest in the world.
In January 2011, the Food Safety Modernization Act [FSMA]
(Public Law 111–353) was signed into law. This law enables the
FDA to better protect public health by strengthening the food safe-
ty system. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food
safety and feed problems rather than relying primarily on reacting
to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with
new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of
compliance with prevention- and risk-based food and feed safety
standards and to better respond to and contain problems when
they do occur. The law also gives the FDA important new tools to
hold imported food and feed to the same standards as domestic food
and feed and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food
safety system in partnership with State and local authorities.
The FDA Drugs programs are comprised of four separate areas:
Human Drugs, Animal Drugs, Medical Devices, and Biologics. The
FDA is responsible for the lifecycle of products, including pre-
market review and post-market surveillance of human and animal
drugs, medical devices, and biological products to ensure their safe-
ty and effectiveness. For Human Drugs, this includes assuring that
all drug products used for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
of disease are safe and effective. Additional procedures include re-
viewing and evaluating investigational new drug applications; eval-
uation of market applications for new and generic drugs and label-
ing and composition of prescription and over-the-counter drugs;
monitoring the quality and safety of products manufactured in, or
imported into, the United States; and regulating the advertising
and promotion of prescription drugs. The Animal Drugs and Feeds
program ensures only safe and effective veterinary drugs, intended
for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases in animals and the
improved production of food-producing animals, are approved for
marketing.
The FDA Biologics program assures that blood and blood prod-
ucts, blood test kits, vaccines, and therapeutics are pure, potent,
safe, effective, and properly labeled. The program inspects blood
banks and blood processors; licenses and inspects firms collecting
human source plasma; evaluates and licenses biologics manufac-
turing firms and products; lot releases licensed products; and mon-
itors adverse events associated with vaccine immunization, blood
products, and other biologics.
The FDA Devices and Radiological program ensures the safety
and effectiveness of medical devices and eliminates unnecessary
human exposure to man-made radiation from medical, occupa-

128
tional, and consumer products. In addition, the program enforces
quality standards under the Mammography Quality Standards Act
(Public Law 108–365). Medical devices include thousands of prod-
ucts from thermometers and contact lenses to heart pacemakers,
hearing aids, and MRIs. Radiological products include items such
as microwave ovens and video display terminals.
The FDA’s National Center for Toxicological Research [NCTR] in
Jefferson, Arkansas, serves as a specialized resource, conducting
peer-review scientific research that provides the basis for the FDA
to make sound, science-based regulatory decisions through its pre-
market review and post-market surveillance. The research is de-
signed to define and understand the biological mechanisms of ac-
tion underlying the toxicity of products and lead to developing
methods to improve assessment of human exposure, susceptibility,
and risk of those products regulated by the FDA.
In 2009, Congress granted the FDA new authority to regulate
the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products.
The FDA exercises this responsibility by protecting the public
health from the health effects of tobacco, setting scientific stand-
ards and standards for tobacco product review, conducting compli-
ance activities to enforce its authority over tobacco, and conducting
public education and outreach about the health effects of tobacco
products.

Accelerated Approval Pathway.—The Committee recognizes the
importance of the FDA’s continued use of the Accelerated Approval
pathway to provide patients with unmet medical needs access to
new therapies, especially to patients with neurological diseases.
Further, the Committee is concerned that the application of the
regulatory flexibility offered under the Accelerated Approval Path-
way is not uniform between the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research [CDER] and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Re-
search [CBER]. The Committee directs the FDA to continue to en-
gage through its Accelerated Approval Council to align policies re-
lated to the use of accelerated approval and to report to the Com-
mittee within 90 days of enactment of this act on how the Acceler-
ated Approval Pathway is being administered uniformly in both
CDER and CBER, including any significant policy documents de-
veloped that facilitate the consistent and appropriate use of Accel-
erated Approval by CDER, CBER and the Oncology Center of Ex-
cellence. Congress gave the FDA the authority to ensure that the
accelerated approval pathway continues to ensure early access to
safe and effective new therapies for individuals with serious or life-
threatening illnesses. The Committee recognizes the importance of
and support for the FDA’s continued use of the Accelerated Ap-
proval pathway to provide patients with unmet medical needs ac-
cess to new therapies. In particular, the Committee supports the

129
FDA’s authority to approve therapies under the accelerated ap-
proval pathway based on surrogate endpoints or intermediate clin-
ical endpoints and remains concerned about other HHS agencies
discouraging the use of the pathway and thus patient access, par-
ticularly related to Alzheimer’s disease therapies.
Additive Ingredients in Drug Products.—The Committee is aware
that the Department of Health and Human Services has announced
plans to phase out the use of certain additive ingredients from food
products in the United States. The Committee also understands
that additional actions may be underway to evaluate the use of cer-
tain additives as inactive ingredients in drug products, including
prescription and over the counter [OTC] ingested drug products. To
ensure that the Department’s efforts to remove synthetic dyes and
other additive ingredients with no medical or nutritious purpose
comprehensively address all products available in the U.S., the
Committee encourages the Commissioner to provide a report to the
Committee listing all additive ingredients, including synthetic dyes,
artificial sweeteners, and artificial flavors, used in prescription and
OTC ingested drug products that the Department plans to phase
out the use of, as well as details on the Department’s plan to elimi-
nate those additive ingredients from food and ingested drug prod-
ucts.
Advanced Manufacturing Technologies.—The Committee encour-
ages the Commissioner to continue to facilitate the utilization of
advanced manufacturing technologies to improve manufacturing ef-
ficiencies and dependability. The Committee requests that the
Commissioner continue to encourage manufacturers of critical ge-
neric sterile injectable products that commonly experience drug
shortages to invest in innovative technologies that are effective and
sustainable.
Agricultural Water Rule.—The Committee directs the Human
Food Program to continue its Produce Safety Network of technical
agents to assist growers in conducting environmental assessments,
evaluating agricultural water, and other crucial food safety func-
tions. The Committee recommends the placement of agents should
take into consideration the top U.S. States in most need of food
safety technical resources, and mixed agricultural regions.
ALS.—The Committee recognizes the FDA’s Orphan Drug Pro-
gram is one of the few programs in the Federal Government that
funds phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials for new ALS therapies.
In addition, FDA-sponsored research can expedite ALS drug devel-
opment through innovative trial designs that can speed the FDA
regulatory processes for new ALS treatments. The Committee pro-
vides no less than the fiscal year 2024 level to support Section 5
of the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act (Act
for ALS; Public Law 117–79), which established the FDA Rare
Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program authorizing grants for
clinical trials for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The
Committee supports Sections 3 and 4 of ACT for ALS, to support
the HHS Public-Private Partnership for Rare Neurodegenerative
Diseases and implementation of the ACT for ALS Action Plan.
Alzheimer’s Disease.—The Committee recognizes and commends
the FDA for its efforts thus far in addressing Alzheimer’s and re-
lated dementias and urges the FDA to fully utilize all existing au-

130
thorities and tools to meet these critical unmet medical needs. It
is vital that the FDA fully applies current science, patient input,
and available regulatory mechanisms to expedite the development
and approval of potential treatments. Prioritizing patient access to
innovative therapies is paramount. The Committee remains com-
mitted to supporting the FDA’s efforts and emphasizes the need for
a proactive and comprehensive approach in tackling this dev-
astating family of diseases.
Andrological Health.—The Committee encourages the FDA to
convene a public meeting discussing areas of unmet need for prod-
ucts addressing male reproductive and sexual health. This meeting
will focus on identifying areas of unmet need and proposals devel-
oping new safe and effective products, focusing on products for
male reproductive and sexual health.
Angelman Syndrome.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of patient-focused drug development for Angelman syndrome, a
rare and devastating monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder. Pa-
tient and family preferences and broader patient experience data
should have an impact on drug development. For this population,
seemingly small gains in self-care are critical for patients and their
caregivers in building toward independence. Without treatments
individuals are completely dependent on a caregiver to perform the
fundamental activities of daily living such as dressing, eating,
grooming, and navigating their environment. The Committee en-
courages the FDA to utilize patient experience data to inform regu-
latory decision-making, as well as the further development of
Angelman syndrome clinical endpoints and biomarkers. The FDA
should ensure clinically meaningful improvements that matter to
patients and families are recognized in regulatory decision-making.
Animal Biotechnology Reviews.—The Committee recognizes the
role of the FDA in regulating intentional genomic alterations in
animals under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 301 et seq.). The Committee encourages the FDA to evalu-
ate and expand opportunities, consistent with existing law, to align
its review policies with a product-based framework and to prioritize
timely, science-based decisions for animal biotechnology products
that do not present new or elevated risks.
Animal Drug Compounding.—The Committee urges the FDA to
provide public clarification on the role of Animal Drug
Compounding in outsourcing facilities registered under section
503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. While both
CVM and CDER have stated in guidance documents that 503B pro-
visions do not apply to animal drugs, many 503B facilities continue
to advertise an ability to compound any needed animal preparation
in their 503B facility. The FDA should publicly clarify the use of
these outsourcing facilities to produce compounded preparations for
animals.
Animal Food Ingredients.—Animal food ingredients are subject to
review by the Center for Veterinary Medicine and animal food ad-
ditives require pre-market approval by the Center before they can
enter the interstate marketplace to be sold for consumption by ei-
ther livestock or pets. The Committee remains concerned about the
time associated with the ingredient review and approval process.
To address these concerns, the Committee includes funding con-

131
sistent with fiscal year 2024 levels and directs the Center for Vet-
erinary Medicine to improve animal food ingredient reviews to en-
able innovation and address challenges and opportunities in the
animal food industry. Further, the Committee directs a briefing
within [60] days of enactment of this act regarding staffing levels
as well as an explanation of what may be contributing to the delays
in review times.
Animal Food Substances.—The Committee understands that the
Center for Veterinary Medicine is working to improve its review
and approval of novel animal food substances that affect the struc-
ture or function of the animal through a means other than nutri-
tion but only act within the animal’s gastrointestinal tract. In some
cases, certain substances are administered orally but not directly
added to the food or drinking water of animals. When reviewing
and approving animal feed ingredient petitions, the Center for Vet-
erinary Medicine shall ensure that substances administered orally,
including boluses, are deemed to be food additives provided they
achieve their intended effects solely within the gastrointestinal
tract and meet other relevant criteria established by the Commis-
sioner.
Animal Product Terminology.—The Committee is concerned
about the increase of products, which do not include meat or egg
products, that are labeled and marketed using animal food product
terminology and related iconography. The Committee directs the
FDA to conduct a study to better understand consumers’ attitudes,
beliefs, motivations, and perceptions relative to product composi-
tion, health attributes, and labeling. The FDA shall assess con-
sumer perceptions of different terms used on labeling of plant-
based alternative products. No later than 1 year after the date of
enactment of this act, the FDA shall submit to the Committee, and
make publicly available online, a report on the findings of this
study.
Antimicrobial Research.—The Committee supports the FDA’s
work to improve the understanding of biofilms and the regulatory
science of biofilms associated with the FDA’s work on medical de-
vices, drug delivery, and public health. The Committee is encour-
aged by the FDA’s goal to reduce healthcare associated infections
as described in the FDA CDRH Regulatory Science Priorities re-
port, support the domestic manufacture of medical devices and
drugs delivery systems.
Artificial Intelligence.—The Committee supports the steps that
the FDA has taken to identify and oversee issues related to AI in
drug development and urges the Commissioner to convene a dedi-
cated, cross-center team of internal experts in AI-enabled drug de-
velopment. Building on existing frameworks and programs, the
Committee encourages the agency to consider engaging subject
matter experts from outside of the agency in artificial intelligence,
as appropriate, to discuss general matters relating to the uses of
AI in drug development. The Commissioner shall provide a report
to the Committee no later than 180 days after enactment of this
act the status of the FDA’s efforts regarding engagement on AI in
drug development.
Artificial Intelligence in Medical Devices.—Within 90 days of en-
actment of this act, the FDA shall conduct an assessment of its ex-

132
isting authorities and provide to Congress a report that identifies,
if any, changes to its statutory authorities necessary for the FDA
to conduct oversight of post-deployment performance and patient
safety monitoring of artificial intelligence/machine learning [AI/
ML] based software as a medical device [SaMD] and AI/ML-en-
abled medical devices. The Commissioner’s report to Congress
should include recommended modifications to authority, law, or
policy, including an estimate of the associated implementation
costs and any adjustment in the allocation of resources.
Avian Influenza.—The FDA shall prioritize inspection and regu-
latory activities for dairy products for human and animal consump-
tion, and animal food for H5N1 virus. The Committee encourages
the FDA to ensure that the HFP, CVM, and OII are sufficiently
staffed and resourced to carry out these duties.
Bacterial Endotoxin Testing.—The Committee recognizes that
use of recombinant Bacterial Endotoxins Testing [rBET] methods
as alternatives to tests using horseshoe crab blood could provide
scientific, economic, supply chain, environmental, and animal pro-
tection benefits in the safety testing of vaccines, injectable thera-
pies, and medical devices. The Committee recognizes that the
United States Pharmacopeia [USP] chapter <86>, which includes
rBET methods for endotoxins testing for products, has been final-
ized. The Committee directs the FDA to update its 2012 Guidance
for Industry on Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing by publishing re-
vised draft guidance within 365 days of enactment of this act to in-
clude acceptance of appropriate rBET methods for endotoxins test-
ing for new and existing products. The FDA will provide staff train-
ing on rBET methods.
Biosimilars.—The Committee recognizes the FDA’s continued
work to approve biosimilars that can enhance competition, drive
down costs to healthcare systems, and increase patient access to
biologic therapies. In May 2025, the FDA approved the 71st bio-
similar product. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue
its commitment to working with industry to resolve delays or set-
backs in a timely manner so that high-quality, safe, and effective
biosimilars, particularly those that would introduce new competi-
tion, can more quickly get to market.
Biotechnology Regulatory Capacity.—The Committee encourages
the FDA to dedicate resources to strengthen staffing and expertise
for reviewing biotechnology-derived food products, including plant-
and microorganism-based innovations. The Committee also encour-
ages the FDA to assess the feasibility of establishing a bio-
technology regulatory fellowship program to support workforce de-
velopment and expand technical capacity in response to increasing
application volume and complexity.
Botanical Dietary Supplements.—The Committee appreciates the
agency’s efforts to strengthen regulation of dietary supplements-in-
cluding through the use of the Dietary Supplement Ingredient Ad-
visory List and the Botanical Safety Consortium. The Committee
encourages the FDA to further invest in research to identify poten-
tial drug interactions with botanical drugs.
Cancer Immunotherapy and Artificial Intelligence [AI].—The
Committee is encouraged by recent progress in developing person-
alized treatments designed for a patient’s unique cancer. AI models

133
specifically are becoming critically important in this effort. The
Committee commends the FDA for advancing the use of these mod-
els by issuing its recent draft guidance, ‘‘Considerations for the Use
of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for
Drug and Biological Products.’’ To provide additional clarity, future
guidance should address how investigators should incorporate time-
ly AI updates into ongoing clinical trials and development path-
ways where the drug relies on an AI output. Therefore, the Com-
mittee encourages the FDA to work with stakeholders to develop
guidance on how to incorporate iterative changes to AI technologies
within the regulatory pathway of an AI-dependent personalized
treatment.
Cannabis.—The Committee is concerned about the proliferation
of products marketed in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act [FFDCA], including products containing derivatives of
the cannabis plant. The Committee is aware that non-FFDCA com-
pliant products pose potential health and safety risks to consumers
through misleading, unsubstantiated, and false claims that can-
nabis and cannabis derivatives can treat serious and life-threat-
ening diseases and conditions, including COVID–19 and cancer.
Cell and Gene Therapy.—The Committee commends the FDA’s
prioritization of cell and gene therapies and directs the agency to
continue to modernize its approach, considering the totality of the
scientific evidence and maximizing approval pathways, especially
for rare and ultra-rare conditions with significant unmet medical
needs. The FDA should review these therapies based on current
scientific understanding and with urgency, particularly for pedi-
atric patients. To advance these efforts, the FDA reviewers are en-
couraged to collaborate with expert researchers and stakeholders to
stay informed about the latest field advancements. While recog-
nizing the critical balance between patient safety and timely access
to potentially life-saving treatments, the Committee is concerned
by the seemingly disproportionate number of clinical holds on cell
and gene therapy trials. Although clinical holds are an appropriate
regulatory mechanism, the Committee urges the FDA to apply
them judiciously and work proactively with sponsors to address
issues without unnecessarily impeding critical research by applying
clinical holds without a clear communication of the rationale.
Cell Cultured Products.—The Committee is aware that in April
of 2020 the U.S. Government Accountability Office completed a
study of cell culture products and found that because no company
was commercially producing cell-cultured meat at that time, there
was a lack of specific information on the technology being used,
eventual commercial production methods, and composition of final
products. The Committee directs the FDA to submit a report no
later than 60 days following the enactment of this act to the Com-
mittee outlining the specific information on the technology being
used commercial production methods, and composition of the final
products that have undergone the FDA’s pre- market consultation
process for human foods made with cultured animal cells.
Centers of Excellence in Advanced and Continuous Pharma-
ceutical Manufacturing.—The Committee supports the FDA’s work
to promote the domestic manufacturing of drug and biological prod-
ucts to bolster drug supply chain resiliency. The Committee directs

134
the FDA to submit a report to the Committee within 120 days of
the enactment of this act with plans to designate National Centers
of Excellence.
Chemotherapy Shortages.—The Committee is concerned by the
recent shortages of commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs, includ-
ing cisplatin and carboplatin. These shortages have hurt cancer
care and resulted in care rationing in some cases. Reliable access
to chemotherapeutic drugs is essential to cancer care. The Com-
mittee is concerned that the FDA has only included a single
chemotherapeutic drug on its Essential Medicines list. The Com-
mittee urges the FDA to continue to take appropriate action to
mitigate future shortages of chemotherapeutic drugs, including con-
sidering the inclusion of additional chemotherapeutic drugs to the
Essential Medicines list.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.—Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease [COPD] continues to be among the leading
causes of death, chronic illness, and disease economic burden in the
United States. Over 15 million Americans have been diagnosed
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and it is esti-
mated that a similar number are undiagnosed and not receiving
appropriate treatment. The Committee is aware of efforts to sup-
port development of COPD treatments for earlier stages of the dis-
ease aiming to slow progression and reduce the burden of disease
on individuals and society. To support these efforts, patient-cen-
tered, novel clinical outcome measures are needed to advance these
potential therapies. The Committee encourages the FDA to con-
tinue to collaborate with the COPD Foundation and other stake-
holders in this important area.
Chronic Pain.—Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in
the U.S. and is increasing faster than other common chronic dis-
eases like diabetes, depression and high blood pressure. Despite the
enormous burden of chronic pain on fifty million Americans, the
healthcare system and the U.S. economy, there has been limited
novel, non-opioid therapeutics approved for chronic pain in more
than a decade. While the Committee is pleased that the FDA re-
leased guidance regarding non-opioid analgesics for acute pain in
2022, the FDA has not released such guidance for chronic pain de-
spite statutory requirements of section 3001(b) of the 2018 SUP-
PORT Act. Therefore, the Committee directs the FDA within 180
days of enactment to issue or update existing guidance to help ad-
dress challenges to developing non-addictive medical products to
manage chronic pain.
Clinical Trial Efficacy.—The Committee supports the FDA’s con-
tinued efforts to require study sponsors to develop and submit ac-
tion plans for including appropriately representative individuals in
phase 3 studies of new drugs. The Committee directs the FDA to
consider strategies that would assist sponsors with how it can use
its authorities in a flexible manner and to provide additional guid-
ance to study sponsors regarding mechanisms to remedy inad-
equate progress as those study sponsors continue to work with the
FDA to overcome common barriers to participation. This includes
restrictive eligibility criteria and limited enrollment outreach, par-
ticularly in rural or underserved areas. The FDA is directed to,
within 180 days of enactment of this act, provide a report to the

135
Committee and to post on a publicly accessible website on steps it
has and can still take to assist sponsors with overcoming barriers
to participation.
Clinical Trial Guidance.—The Committee welcomes the draft
guidance under docket FDA–2023–D–1987. The Committee directs
the FDA to issue final guidance no later than 270 days after the
enactment of this act.
Clinical Trial Operations.—The Committee recognizes that staff-
ing shortages are present at clinical research sites, exacerbating
longstanding challenges to the timely collection and efficient re-
porting of clinical trial data in cancer research. The burden of data
collection, entry, and verification is high and rests primarily with
site staff, who most often input data manually. Meanwhile, the
data fields requested for developing a given drug class have become
increasingly numerous and may be complex. The Committee urges
the FDA to provide guidance to cancer trial sites, sponsors, and
contractors that both defines necessary data elements and stream-
lines data entry and verification processes. Such guidance will be
foundational in maximizing clinical trial efficiency through a tar-
geted reduction of the administrative burden currently placed upon
research staff.
Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing.—The Committee ap-
preciates the FDA’s continued efforts to adapt drug manufacturing
guidance to align with new advanced manufacturing processes such
as continuous flow manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredi-
ents [API], including the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research’s Framework for Regulatory Advanced Manufacturing
Evaluation [FRAME] Initiative. The Committee is concerned that
a current lack of clear standards and realistic quality assessment
methods for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing are creating
unnecessary risk for capital investments in advanced manufac-
turing equipment. The Committee notes the promising potential for
continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing to reduce the cost of ge-
neric pharmaceutical production and make it more financially via-
ble to increase generic pharmaceutical manufacturing in the
United States. The Committee also notes that investors and manu-
facturers may hesitate to make the significant capital investments
required to purchase continuous manufacturing equipment when
standard practices for quality monitoring and licensing are not yet
established.
Counterfeit Drugs.—The Committee is concerned by the in-
creased presence of counterfeit drugs in the U.S. pharmaceutical
distribution supply chain. The Committee directs the FDA to pro-
vide a report that outlines the challenges that the FDA faces with
preventing counterfeit drugs from entering the U.S. pharmaceutical
distribution supply chain and reaching patients. The report should
include recommendations for funding or authorities needed to ad-
dress this problem to protect public health and should be provided
to the Committee within 120 days of the enactment of this act.
Dietary Supplements.—The Committee applauds the FDA’s policy
and enforcement actions against manufacturers of dietary supple-
ment products that are adulterated or misbranded but recognizes
that more resources are needed to address products that are con-
taminated, either intentionally or unintentionally, with unsafe in-

136
gredients. The Committee has noted the agency’s efforts to
strengthen regulation of dietary supplements—including through
the recently re-released Dietary Supplement Ingredient Directory
and the Botanical Safety Consortium—but encourages increased
enforcement activities and interagency collaboration with the De-
partment of Justice to remove illegal dietary supplements from the
market. The Committee encourages the FDA to increase enforce-
ment of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act
[DSHEA], including inspection and enforcement activities. The
FDA shall continue to update the Committee, explaining how the
agency carries out risk-based enforcement of dietary supplement
product manufacturers and the resources it used for these activi-
ties.
Drug Approvals.—The Committee asserts that the FDA’s author-
ity to approve medications should be solely based on sound science
and devoid of political or economic considerations.
Drug Shortages.—The Committee is concerned by ongoing drug
shortages in the United States, including for drugs that have been
on the shortage list for many years, without solutions to remove
them from the list. The Committee directs the FDA to provide a
briefing that outlines how it is working with industry to facilitate
the resolution of drug shortages and discuss potential recommenda-
tions for improving supply chain resilience to reduce the potential
for such drugs to return to list in the future. The briefing should
be held within 120 days of the enactment of this act and should
also include the methodology used by the FDA to determine wheth-
er a drug meets the statutory standard for addition to or removal
from the drug shortage list.
Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.—There are currently
eight approved therapies for Duchenne, five of which aim to ad-
dress the underlying cause of Duchenne. One of those five is a gene
therapy. In addition, individuals with Duchenne are routinely pre-
scribed a variety of therapies for symptom management-including
three approvals for Duchenne-specific symptoms. However, a sig-
nificant unmet need remains. The Committee recognizes the impor-
tant work of patient, provider, and research organizations to better
understand the effects of these products used in sequence and en-
courages the FDA to collaborate in this initiative.
East Asia Offices.—The Committee is aware of the need for the
FDA to have a permanent presence in East Asia, outside of China,
to conduct inspections, including unannounced inspections, and
strengthen regulatory control and oversight for products being pro-
duced in that region, including devices, drugs, and aquaculture
products. Therefore, the Committee instructs the FDA to establish
within the Office of Global Policy and Strategy [OGPS] an East
Asia Regional Office with locations in Hanoi, Vietnam and Tokyo,
Japan. The Committee provides an additional $1,800,000 to the
OGPS to support this initiative. In addition, the FDA is directed
to spend not less than $5,000,000 on these efforts.
Essential Medical Devices.—The FDA issued a safety communica-
tion in November 2023, with additional updates in March, April,
and May of 2025, warning consumers, healthcare providers, and
healthcare facilities to avoid syringes that are manufactured in
China due to quality and patient safety concerns around leaks,

137
breakage, and other problems. However, foreign needles and sy-
ringes, particularly from China, continue to be imported into the
U.S. These products are being widely used throughout the U.S.
healthcare system despite the serious risks to patients and the re-
sulting erosion of the domestic manufacturing base. The Committee
strongly supports efforts to protect patient safety, national security,
and vulnerable domestic supply chains for critical industries, like
essential medical devices. The Committee directs the FDA to pro-
vide a report to the Committee on steps it will take to increase
awareness of problematic syringes from China, including discussion
of the use of domestically produced syringes as alternatives where
appropriate.
Essential Medicines.—The Committee requests the Commis-
sioner, in coordination with other relevant Federal entities, and, as
appropriate, in consultation with stakeholders who have relevant
expertise, update, maintain, and publish a list of essential medi-
cines initially developed in response to Executive Order 13944 (85
Fed. Reg. 49929) to include drug and biological products, including
their active ingredients that are: directly related to responding to
chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats and incidents;
of greatest priority for providing healthcare and identified as being
at high risk of shortage; or the shortage of which would have an
adverse health outcome on patients with chronic conditions. Using
the products listed on the Essential Medicines List, the Committee
requests the Secretary, in coordination with other relevant Federal
entities, and through public-private partnerships, map, or other-
wise visualize, the supply chains of the drug and biological prod-
ucts on the Essential Medicines List, including, to the extent data
are available, their key starting materials, excipients, and active
ingredients. The Committee encourages the Commissioner to use
data analytics to identify supply chain vulnerabilities that pose a
threat to national and health security. The Committee directs the
Secretary to submit a report to the relevant committees of Con-
gress on (1) the current status of efforts to map and analyze supply
chains for essential medicines, including coordination among rel-
evant Federal entities; and (2) the extent to which the FDA uses
data analytics to conduct predictive modeling for anticipated drug
shortages and risks associated with supply chain vulnerabilities
that pose a threat to national security; and (3) any gaps or limita-
tions in utilizing data analytics to mitigate identified risks, includ-
ing drug shortages, and increase resiliency of essential medicine
supply chains.
Expert Panels.—The Committee is concerned with panels that
the FDA recently deployed to evaluate scientific matters related to
talc, infant formula, and cell and gene therapies that could impact
public health. The FDA should assess scientific issues in a trans-
parent manner and must adhere to principles established by Con-
gress in the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Committee is
concerned that the agency did not allow public participation or pro-
vide for public comments and panelists did not disclose potential
conflicts of interest. The FDA must follow long standing practices
that ensure processes and decisionmaking are transparent, unbi-
ased, and grounded in science. The Committee expects that any fu-

138
ture engagement with regards to these and other topics will be
based on sound science and free from conflicts of interest.
Food Labeling Accuracy.—The Committee supports evaluating
whether artificial intelligence [AI] driven audit tools can effectively
assess food labeling accuracy and facilitate greater Federal labeling
compliance. The Human Foods Program [HFP] is responsible for
assuring that foods sold in the United States are safe and properly
labeled. The Committee believes that AI-driven tools will accelerate
HFP’s goal of ensuring the accuracy of food labeling consistent with
the Agency’s obligation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act to monitor and en-
sure that food labels are truthful and not misleading. The Com-
mittee directs HFP’s to report to the Committee by on the status
of its evaluation.
Food Regulations.—The Committee strongly supports efforts to
provide Americans with healthier food choices but is troubled by
the lack of coordination and transparency between the USDA,
FDA, and CDC in safeguarding our Nation’s food supply, particu-
larly during foodborne illness outbreak investigations. The Com-
mittee directs the FDA in coordination with the USDA and CDC
to provide recommendations on ways to improve interagency col-
laboration in order to efficiently deploy inspectional resources, con-
duct coordinated outbreak investigations, and provide unified mes-
sages to the American public. There are concerns that information
communicated to the public in the past may have been inaccurate.
Therefore, the Committee requests that the USDA, FDA, and CDC
acknowledge that initial hypotheses may need to be updated based
on new scientific evidence and final conclusions must be based on
robust evidence. These recommendations should also include ways
to work with the industry to improve food safety. USDA, FDA, and
CDC should collaborate with industry during outbreak investiga-
tions to prevent future events. The Committee requests a report
from the USDA, FDA, and CDC on these recommendations within
90 days of enactment of this act to ensure that U.S. consumers
have access to safe, healthy and affordable foods.
Food Chemical and Color Reviews.—The Committee directs the
Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to use robust and well-estab-
lished scientific principles to conduct pre-market assessments on
chemicals that could end up in the food supply, when such assess-
ments are required by law or regulation, and to prioritize and con-
duct post-market food chemical assessments (or reviews) resulting
in risk-based conclusions while prioritizing risk management prac-
tices as needed for chemicals already in the food supply. The Com-
mittee directs the FDA to proceed through a post-market review
assessment of color additives authorized by the FDA under the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [FD&C Act) before the removal of
any use authorizations other than removal based on industry aban-
donment or where such color additives are deemed unsafe by law.
The Committee is aware of potential impacts to the U. S. food sup-
ply chain of any widespread phase out on color additives authorized
by FDA under the FD&C Act and directs the FDA, in consultation
with other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate, to en-
sure that any changes will not significantly disrupt the U.S. food
supply while considering any phase outs of ingredients.

139
Food Safety Modernization Act Outreach to Small Farmers.—The
Committee directs that of the of the funding provided for the
Human Foods Program and related field activities in the Office of
Inspections and Investigations, no less than the fiscal year 2025
amount shall be provided to support outreach, training, and tech-
nical assistance to farmers, including small farmers, to assist them
in meeting the requirements of the Food Safety Modernization Act.
Field Based Prevention Strategies.—The Committee directs the
FDA Center for Excellence to continue to dedicate funds as nec-
essary to develop field-based prevention strategies for the fresh
produce industry.
Foreign Approved Drugs.—The Committee supports efforts to in-
crease the tools available to the FDA to ensure the timely approval
of lifesaving drugs and encourages the FDA to examine opportuni-
ties to facilitate submission of marketing applications by manufac-
turers of drugs with marketing authorization in countries listed in
21 U.S.C. 382, Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act section
802(b), but which are not approved in the United States.
Foreign Medical Device Inspections.—The Committee is con-
cerned about medical device recalls from foreign facilities and di-
rects the FDA to strengthen its foreign inspection pilot programs
to include medical device inspections. The FDA should identify
what, if anything, is needed to increase unannounced inspections
of overseas drug and device manufacturers, with emphasis on fa-
cilities in China and India where quality issues are most prevalent.
The FDA should enhance inspector language capabilities, techno-
logical resources, and staffing levels across both programs. The
Committee expects the FDA to report within 180 days on concrete
steps taken to integrate and improve these inspection programs, in-
cluding unified metrics on inspection frequency, violation rates,
and progress in eliminating the backlog of uninspected facilities.
The report shall detail specific measures that are available if ef-
forts to conceal violations during inspections are discovered and en-
sure imported drugs and devices consistently meet U.S. safety
standards.
Grain Reconditioning.—The Committee is aware of delays in the
FDA’s approval for a reconditioning process after the Federal Grain
Inspection Service [FGIS] has determined the inspected grain at
export facilities to be Distinct Low Quality. The Committee directs
the FDA and USDA to update their Memorandum of Under-
standing [MOU] regarding their respective timely responsibilities
in the inspection and standardization of grain, rice, pulses, and
food products, to allow pre-approved reconditioning plans for lost/
sublots of grain that are found actionable for specific conditions. In
updating the MOU, the Committee directs the FDA and USDA to
consult with key stakeholders, including industry.
Golden Sea Bream.—In order to improve access to Stenotomus
chrysops outside of New England, the Committee encourages the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs to begin the process of adding
‘‘Golden Sea Bream’’ as an acceptable market name for Stenotomus
chrysops within 180 days of the enactment of this act.
Hawaii Coffee.—The Committee includes bill language regarding
Hawaii Grown Coffee and directs the FDA to update its Beverages
and Beverage Materials guidance and any other relevant guid-

140
ance’s to clarify or add any additional food safety issues that may
arise due to this change within 180 days of enactment.
Heavy Metals in Baby Food.—The Committee is concerned that
lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury are often present in dangers
quantities in foods intended for consumption by infants and tod-
dlers and encourages the FDA to coordinate with the USDA to en-
sure that a wide variety of healthy nutritious foods remain avail-
able to participants of Federal nutrition programs.
Highly Sensitized Kidney Transplant Patients.—The Committee
recognizes that highly sensitized patients, who comprise 10–30 per-
cent of the kidney transplant waiting list, face severe challenges in
finding compatible donor organs. These patients experience signifi-
cantly higher rejection rates compared to non-sensitized patients,
and many remain on dialysis for extended periods. The Committee
notes that current desensitization protocols, while promising, still
face challenges with antibody rebound and high rejection rates. The
Committee directs the FDA to submit a report within 180 days
after enactment of this act detailing strategies to facilitate the de-
velopment and approval of desensitization therapies, ensure the
safety of medications used in desensitization protocols, and improve
long-term outcomes for highly sensitized patients.
Hiring Freeze Related to Scientists and Product Reviewers.—The
Committee is concerned about hiring restrictions in place at the
FDA for scientists, product reviewers, and inspectors. As the FDA
continues necessary modernization to meet the needs of the fast-
paced development of innovation in the United States, a key com-
ponent is ensuring its workforce has the up-to-date expertise to
meet those needs. The FDA is a science-based regulatory agency
whose crucial mission is to protect and promote public health;
which is heavily reliant on the expertise and contributions of its
scientific staff. The FDA’s scientists are at the forefront of regu-
latory science, which involves developing new tools, standards, and
approaches to assess regulated products. Their technical expertise
is essential for keeping pace with scientific and technological ad-
vancements and improving public health outcomes. The FDA’s
inspectorate is on the front lines of safeguarding public health by
verifying that facilities and products comply with Federal laws and
regulations. Inspections help to identify potential hazards and non-
compliance issues before they escalate into public health crises, like
outbreaks of foodborne illness. By inspecting manufacturing proc-
esses and assessing product quality, inspectors ensure that drugs,
medical devices, and other regulated products meet rigorous safety
and efficacy standards. The Committee is aware of the challenges
facing recruitment and retention of qualified candidates for these
positions and directs the FDA to remove the hiring restrictions in
place for these key roles within 30 days of enactment of this act.
The Committee provides that no department or agency funded in
this or any other appropriations Acts, including prior year Acts,
may continue the freeze on the hiring of Federal civilian employees
imposed by the Presidential Memorandum dated January 20, 2025
(Hiring Freeze), and extended in the Presidential Memorandum
dated April 15, 2025 (Extension of Hiring Freeze), for scientists,
product reviewers, and inspectors at the FDA: Provided, That, not-
withstanding any merit hiring plan that either has been adopted

141
or is adopted subsequent to the date of enactment of this act pursu-
ant to Executive Order 14710 of January 20, 2025 (Reforming the
Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Serv-
ice), any such hiring of scientists, product reviewers, and inspectors
at the FDA shall be exempted from the hiring freeze pursuant to
this section within 30 days of the date enactment of this act: Pro-
vided further, That any further extension of the hiring freeze re-
ferred to in this section that occurs subsequent to the date of enact-
ment of this act shall not apply to scientists, product reviewers,
and inspectors at the FDA.
HIV Self-Testing.—The Committee supports advancement of
technologies that enable rapid self-testing for HIV, particularly
those technologies that detect HIV in patients on current or future
therapeutics and vaccines. The Committee notes the critical impor-
tance of having such self-testing technologies available before HIV
vaccines reach the market in order to eliminate false positive re-
sults with current tests and to support vaccine adoption. The Com-
mittee encourages the FDA to prioritize meritorious proposals to
bring these important tests to market.
Homeopathy.—The Committee understands the importance of ho-
meopathic medicines for millions of users. Consumers access and
safety to these products are best ensured by implementing a legal
pathway that includes homeopathic specific standards for the regu-
lation of these medicines. The Committee understands the FDA is
limited to enforcing pharmaceutical specific standards when taking
enforcement action against products labeled as homeopathic. The
FDA’s interpretation of the law that all homeopathic medicines are
unapproved new drugs that are illegally marketed has created con-
fusion both for the homeopathic community and enforcement offi-
cials. The Committee directs the FDA to work with the homeo-
pathic community with regards to the regulation of these medi-
cines.
HPV Self-Sampling.—One in four women in the United States do
not receive regular cervical cancer screenings, with more than half
of cervical cancer diagnoses occurring in women who are not
screened. While there are many barriers to screening, some of the
top include fear of the procedure, embarrassment, or lack of time
or transportation. The Committee encourages the FDA to exercise
the use of regulatory authorities to expedite innovation related to
at-home self-collection tests that could increase and expand access
to screenings for women and address a persistent cancer health
disparity for women who are never screened or under-screened.
Human Drug Review Performance Trends.—The concurrent in-
vestment of discretionary resources and Prescription Drug User
Fee Act [PDUFA] Program funds has resulted in a successful pro-
gram for over three decades enabling faster review times in the
United States, thus allowing the American people to gain quicker
access to the FDA approved prescription drugs. The Committee is
aware of a recent decrease in the FDA first cycle approval rates
[FCA] with an increasing number of Complete Response Letters
[CRLs] being issued to drug manufacturers. This decline is ob-
served across all human drug review programs, including novel
drug approvals. To keep with the stated goals within the PDUFA
Performance Goals to increase the first cycle approval rate for

142
medicines that are ultimately approved, the Committee directs the
FDA to provide a report to the Committee with an analysis of how
issues that led to CRLs for medicines over the past 5 years could
have been resolved within the first review cycle. This analysis
should assess issues relating to both the FDA and sponsor company
responsibilities and make recommendations on: how sponsors and
the FDA can work better on timely identification and resolution of
potential issues; the extent to which and how the global pandemic
impacted performance and FCAs between February 2020 to May
2023; and how challenges in the human drug review process may
be resolved with the ultimate goal of increasing FCA rates and
faster patient access to safe and effective prescription drugs.
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy.—The Committee recognizes
the lack of any pharmaceutical treatment for infants born with
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy [HIE], a rare brain injury due to
insufficient cerebral oxygen and blood flow. While HIE injuries
tragically takes the lives of many newborns, of the surviving ba-
bies, approximately 25 percent will endure significant and lifelong
neurological disability. HIE is a leading cause of physical and cog-
nitive deficits, including recurrent seizures and cerebral palsy. Due
to the severity of the condition, long-term impact on the patients,
and high cost to healthcare, the Committee encourages the FDA to
consider endpoints for clinical trials that may predict improve-
ments in neurodevelopmental outcomes and expedite therapeutic
development for HIE.
Illegal Import of Unapproved New Drugs.—The Committee ex-
presses deep concern over the health risks posed by illegal importa-
tion of unapproved and misbranded drugs, particularly through
third-party brokers facilitating access via employer-sponsored
health plans. These unapproved drugs lack the FDA’s oversight,
potentially containing incorrect dosages, unknown ingredients, or
contaminants, which can lead to serious health consequences, espe-
cially for vulnerable populations with conditions like HIV, cancer,
or hepatitis. The substitution of an FDA-approved medications with
unapproved versions can cause patient confusion, medication er-
rors, and negatively impact treatment outcomes, as healthcare pro-
viders may unknowingly base decisions on patients’ responses to
these unregulated drugs. Furthermore, sourcing from uninspected
and unregulated supply chains increases the risk of receiving adul-
terated or improperly stored medications. Given these significant
dangers, the Committee directs the FDA to provide a comprehen-
sive report within 180 days, addressing various aspects of this
issue, including safety risks, verification challenges, enforcement
actions, and recommendations for strengthening oversight. This ac-
tion is critical to protect U.S. consumers from the potential harm
of unapproved and misbranded drugs circumventing regulatory
safeguards.
Imported Shrimp Safety and Inspection Pilot Program.—The
Committee commends and supports the FDA’s ongoing efforts to
implement and increase its oversight and the regulation of the
safety of shrimp products imported into the United States. The
Committee maintains the fiscal year 2025 funding levels to imple-
ment the program. The FDA’s prior reports to Congress empha-
sized the importance of increased sampling of import shipments,

143
investment in laboratory capabilities, data analytics, and the estab-
lishment of regulatory partnership arrangements with the top
three countries exporting shrimp to the U.S. The Committee en-
courages the FDA to continue the full development and implemen-
tation of the shrimp pilot program including finalizing the estab-
lishment of regulatory partnership arrangements. The FDA Com-
missioner shall provide the Committee a briefing before the end of
fiscal year 2026 summarizing how the funds appropriated have
been used and how the funds support the FDA in meeting the ob-
jectives of section 787 of Public Law 116–260.
Increased Enforcement Action Against Unauthorized E–Cigarettes
and Tobacco Improvements.—The Committee remains deeply con-
cerned about data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey show-
ing 1.63 million youth use e-cigarettes and urges the FDA to use
its full authority to address this serious public health problem. The
Committee also remains deeply concerned with the enormous surge
of flavored disposable e-cigarettes and nicotine pouch products
being illegally imported into the U.S., primarily from China, that
are openly evading the FDA’s regulatory requirements. The Com-
mittee believes these illegal imports constitute an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the public health of the United States.
The Committee directs the FDA to prioritize the use of resources
by (1) establishing a floor of $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 to
be spend on enforcement activities to ensure these illegal products
are expeditiously removed from the market and that those illegally
importing and distributing such products are subject to significant
compliance and enforcement actions. (2) Out of the funds provided
in (1), $2,000,000 shall be used to support activities related to the
Federal multi-agency task force created in June 2024 to combat the
illegal distribution and sale of e-cigarettes, which could include en-
forcement actions taken by members of the task force. The task
force shall:
(a) Include all Federal agencies that have roles or responsibil-
ities related to e-cigarette enforcement, including but not
limited to the Food and Drug Administration, Department of
Justice, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals Service; the Department
of Homeland Security, including Customs and Boarder Pro-
tection and Homeland Security Investigations within Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement; the U.S. Postal Inspec-
tion Service, and the Federal Trade Commission;
(b) Meet at least quarterly to develop and implement a com-
prehensive strategy for reducing the number of unauthor-
ized e-cigarettes on the market, including setting goals,
sharing information, and coordinating efforts where appro-
priate; and
(c) Report to the Committees of Appropriations in the Senate
and House within 90 days of enactment of this Act and an-
nually thereafter on enforcement actions that the task force
or members of the task force have taken against unauthor-
ized e-cigarettes.
The Committee is also concerned that the agency has not com-
pleted its review of many e-cigarettes and other deemed tobacco

144
products that are popular with youth and has allowed scores of un-
authorized products to be sold without the authorization required
by statute, whether because they failed to submit a premarket ap-
plication, have a pending application, or have been denied. The
Committee is deeply concerned that many tobacco products that
lack the legally required marketing authorization from the FDA re-
main on the market, including flavored products that are attractive
to youth. The wide availability of these unauthorized products is
hindering efforts to reduce youth use of e-cigarettes and other to-
bacco products. Notwithstanding the large number of premarket
applications received and resolved, the FDA too seldom completes
its reviews within the time established by law. The Committee
urges the FDA to promptly complete its required premarket review
of e-cigarettes and to deny authorization for any product that does
not meet the statutory standard of ‘‘appropriate for the protection
of the public health,’’ including denying authorization for all prod-
ucts, especially flavored products, that have increased or are likely
to increase initiation by youth or non-tobacco users. The Committee
urges the FDA to pursue all legally authorized remedies to ensure
that all products being sold unlawfully are removed from the mar-
ketplace.
Infant Formula.—The Committee remains concerned about the
domestic production of infant formula after the 2022 infant formula
crisis and that since the 2022 crisis, there have been several in-
stances of cronobacter being found in infant formula and illness
and death among babies who consumed it. The Committee directs
the FDA to use all authorities to prevent contaminated infant for-
mula from making it to market. The Committee also directs the
FDA to streamline approval processes for domestic manufacturers
to increase and expand the domestic supply of infant formula and
bring jobs to the Unites States. FDA is directed to brief the Com-
mittee on what authorities and funding would be necessary for the
Agency to take the following actions: 1) require infant formula
manufacturers to report to the FDA within one business day of
learning that formula that was processed by the manufacturer but
that is no longer within the manufacturer’s control may not provide
required nutrients or may be otherwise adulterated or misbranded;
2) require that if any testing of finished infant formula reveals the
presence of specified microorganisms (e.g., salmonella), the manu-
facturer must notify the FDA within one business day; 3) require
that the manufacturer must also promptly provide the test results
to the FDA and consult with the FDA on proper isolation and dis-
posal of the affected product; 4) that FDA to respond to such a noti-
fication and begin discussing proper investigative and corrective ac-
tion with the manufacturer within one business day; 5) Within 90
days of a report of adulterated, misbranded, or contaminated infant
formula, determine whether the manufacturer that reported the
problem has performed, or is performing, appropriate investigative
and corrective action; 6) annually report on the infant formula sup-
ply chain and efforts to improve the safety and supply of infant for-
mula, in consultation with other Federal agencies and infant for-
mula stakeholders on these issues.
Innovative Glass Packaging.—The Committee directs the FDA to
work with glass packaging suppliers and pharmaceutical manufac-

145
turers to evaluate and promote streamlined approval requirements
designed to expedite the adoption and use of innovative glass pack-
aging technologies with the capacity to improve product quality, re-
duce product recalls, reduce drug shortages, and protect public
health. Such streamlined approval requirements should address
stability testing and other relevant types of data to be submitted
in support of product approval.
Insomnia.—The Committee strongly encourages the FDA to work
expeditiously with the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] to
prioritize actions related to FDA-approved DORA class substances,
currently controlled in Schedule IV under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act and indicated as treatments for insomnia. The Com-
mittee understands that our servicemembers, veterans, and first
responders have a higher-than-average prevalence of insomnia, and
that the DEA and the FDA are currently undergoing a review to
determine an appropriate control status for, or potentially
deschedule, the DORA class insomnia treatments. The FDA is cur-
rently conducting an Eight Factor Analysis as part of this review
process to evaluate the abuse potential, medical use, and safety of
DORA class medications in relation to drug schedules under the
Controlled Substances Act. The FDA is directed to complete this re-
view in a timely manner so that DEA can expedite a review of its
findings. The FDA is directed to report back to the Committee
within 30 days of enactment of this act with an update.
Inspections.—The Committee recognizes that inspecting a facility
for a new drug application is highly complex because the FDA must
thoroughly evaluate whether the manufacturing site can consist-
ently produce the drug with the identity, strength, quality, and pu-
rity claimed in the application, which involves detailed audits of
records, equipment, processes, and data integrity. This process re-
quires coordination among multidisciplinary experts who assess
compliance with current good manufacturing practices [CGMP] and
verify that the facility’s operations align precisely with the applica-
tion’s Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls [CMC] information,
often under tight timelines and with global supply chain consider-
ations. However, the Committee is concerned with reports that the
FDA is issuing Complete Response Letters [CRLs] for drug applica-
tions due to a lack of timeliness and therefore what appears to be
a pause only to allow the FDA time to fully complete the inspection
which results in no finding of a concern. Or, a CRL is issued based
on facility inspection issues unrelated to that specific drug applica-
tion. Both circumstances could force delays in the approval process
since these inspections are often conducted late in the review cycle,
leaving insufficient time for sponsors to address deficiencies. The
Committee fully supports the FDA’s efforts to ensure that drug pro-
duction facilities are safe and meet CGMP standards; however in
order to better understand this issue the FDA is directed to report
back to the Committee on the number of CRLs associated with in-
spections, (i.e, CRLs resulting solely from inspections with Official
Action Indicated [OAI] or potential OAI [pOAI] outcomes), includ-
ing the number of those inspections that were Pre-Approval Inspec-
tions [PAI].
Inspection Frequency.—The Committee is concerned that food fa-
cilities are not inspected frequently enough to adequately identify

146
and respond to risks. Under the Food Safety Modernization Act,
high-risk domestic facilities must be inspected every 3 years and
other domestic facilities must be inspected every 5 years. The Com-
mittee directs the FDA to provide a report, not later than 180 days
after the enactment of this act, regarding its resource analysis on
increasing the frequency of inspections to every 18 months for
high-risk domestic facilities and every 3 years for non-high-risk do-
mestic facilities, while continuing other important public health ac-
tivities, including oversight of imported food safety.
International Mail Facilities.—The Committee remains concerned
about the opioid epidemic and imports of illegal tobacco products.
The Committee supports the FDA’s continued investments in Inter-
national Mail Facilities and Ports of Entry to prevent illicit prod-
ucts, from entering the United States.
Islet Cells.—The appearance of certain islet autoantibodies in the
serum of individuals increases the chance of developing type 1 dia-
betes at some point in the future. Therefore, the Committee encour-
ages the FDA to continue working with the Type 1 diabetes com-
munity on the assessment of potential diabetes biomarkers related
to islet autoimmunity, which might help inform the design of clin-
ical studies.
Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal
Drugs.—On December 13, 2016, the Limited Population Pathway
for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD pathway) was added
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act through sec-
tion 3042 of the 21st Century Cures Act (section 506(h) of the
FD&C Act). This pathway provides stakeholders, including the
FDA and industry, with a tool to help with the approval of anti-
bacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious and life-threatening
infections in a limited population of patients with unmet needs. On
August 5, 2020, the FDA published a Final Guidance for Industry:
Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal
Drugs. In 2021 the Government Accountability Office [GAO] pub-
lished a report highlighting the fact that the pathway was infre-
quently used. The Committee directs the GAO to revisit and up-
date this report and include recommendations to improve utiliza-
tion of the LPAD program.
Listeria.—The Committee recognizes that developing the Compli-
ance Policy Guide [CPG] for Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat
foods is a complex process and directs the FDA to work with stake-
holders to ensure that the CPG outlines a policy that is reflective
of the current scientific evidence and is practical to implement.
Lupus.—The Committee is aware of barriers that have long af-
fected the development of therapeutics for lupus, a disease that pri-
marily affects women. The Committee is pleased that the FDA has
partnered with researchers, industry, patients, and other stake-
holders to launch the Lupus Accelerating Breakthroughs Consor-
tium [ABC], a public-private partnership to accelerate development
of new therapies. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue
this engagement and provide updates on its efforts to accelerate de-
velopment of safer and more effective treatments for people with
lupus.
Maple Syrup Definition.—The Committee is concerned that the
FDA has not responded to the citizen petition by updating standard

147
of identity of pure maple syrup, which was received in December
2018. The Committee encourages the FDA to finalize the changes
outlined in the citizen petition within 1 year of the enactment of
this act.
Medical Device Review Transparency.—Within 120 days of enact-
ment, FDA is directed to brief the Committee on additional steps
it could take to improve transparency on medical device reviews
(beyond quarterly and annual MDUFA performance reporting, pub-
lic-facing databases, and independent external audits). This brief-
ing shall include information on how the Agency can publicly share
performance metrics, the number of device approvals by device risk
classification (e.g., Class I, II, III] on an annual basis, and consider-
ations for initiation of a pilot effort to publish additional
anonymized summaries of marketing applications, to the extent al-
lowed by law. The briefing shall include information on potential
hurdles, such as authorities and cost.
Medical Foods.—The Committee recognizes the unique role med-
ical foods play in the nutritional management of inborn errors of
metabolism and encourages a flexible regulatory process that would
enhance access to safe medical foods for individuals with serious or
life-threatening inborn errors of metabolism. The Committees en-
courages the FDA to continue focusing on this issue.
Medications Safety and Effectiveness.—The Committee supports
the FDA’s authority to approve medications based on the scientific
evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the medication, as well as
its authority to determine the methodology to adequately perform
the scientific evaluation.
Medical Supply Chain Surveillance.—The Committee appreciates
the FDA’s work to address drug shortages and other medical sup-
ply chain issues, but these continue to persist and cause harm. The
Committee urges the FDA to build on its June 2021 recommenda-
tions to improve transparency throughout the pharmaceutical sup-
ply chain by continuing to support the development of information
systems to anticipate drug or other medical supply shortages in
order to be able to act to work to prevent and/or mitigate short-
ages. A special emphasis should be placed on drug shortages, par-
ticularly sterile injectable drugs, which were found to be the drugs
most commonly in short supply in the Drug Shortages Taskforce its
report ‘‘Drug Shortages: Root Causes and Potential Solutions’’. The
Committee urges the FDA to partner with other divisions in the
Department of Health and Human Services, such as to expedite the
development or licensure of a coordinated medical supply chain
surveillance system to support strategies to proactively prevent or
mitigate drug shortages. This effort should include the Administra-
tion for Strategic Preparedness and Response and other govern-
mental and nongovernmental organizations as deemed necessary.
Menopause and Mid-Life Women’s Health.—The Committee en-
courages the FDA to continue outreach and engagement activities
with healthcare providers and researchers on perimenopause,
menopause, postmenopause and mid-life women’s health, and to fa-
cilitate the development and testing of new pharmacological (hor-
monal and non-hormonal) treatments for menopausal symptoms, as
well as oversight and consumer protection efforts to assess the
safety and effectiveness of new diagnostic tools for menopausal

148
symptoms, including devices that use artificial intelligence. Within
180 days of enactment of this act, the FDA is directed to provide
a report on its activities, including specific information on research,
staffing, outreach and engagement activities, and coordination with
Federal agencies.
Metastatic Cancer.—The Committee recognizes the FDA for ongo-
ing efforts to gather input and patient-focused feedback from the
metastatic cancer community. The Committee notes the ongoing
challenge identified by patients of needing access to multiple thera-
peutic option and various sites of care due to the fact that patients
with metastatic cancer often progress through multiple therapies,
and encourages the FDA to continue working to ensure multiple
safe and effective therapeutic options with varying delivery mecha-
nisms are available.
Microplastics Testing.—The Committee directs the FDA’s Human
Foods Program to develop a validated testing methodology for de-
tection and analysis of microplastics in human foods, including
standards for sample collection, sample preparation, minimum par-
ticle size, and analysis to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Such program shall, once finalized, be added to the FDA Foods Pro-
gram Compendium of Analytical Laboratory Methods: Chemical
Analytical Compendium. The Secretary shall further directs the
FDA Human Foods Program to implement a program to evaluate
the ability of laboratories to perform the testing methodology.
Minimal (or Measurable) Residual Disease.—To expedite the de-
velopment and safe patient access to new therapeutics, the FDA is
encouraged to support collaborative research with the National In-
stitutes of Health, universities, and industry, regarding the utiliza-
tion of Minimal (or Measurable) Residual Disease [MRD] testing to
assess response to therapy and predict patient outcomes in its eval-
uation of therapeutic products. The Committee directs the FDA to
report within 1 year of the enactment of this act on advances in
the science and development of products directed to the determina-
tion of MRD, that might soon enable the utilization of MRD to
serve as an exploratory endpoint for clinical trial evaluations.
MoCRA.—The Committee is concerned that the FDA has not im-
plemented key provisions of the Modernization of Cosmetics Regu-
lation Act [MoCRA], which gave the FDA additional authorities to
ensure that cosmetic products are safe for the American public. To
address these concerns the Committee provides an additional
$2,000,000 to aid in the implementation of MoCRA. The Committee
requests a report within 90 days of the enactment of this act, that
includes a timeline for undergoing rulemaking and promulgating
regulations for Good Manufacturing Practices and Fragrance Aller-
gen Labeling for cosmetic products. The report should also include
any challenges that the FDA is facing with implementing MoCRA
in a timely manner.
Neurology Drug Program.—The Committee is encouraged by the
Agency’s hiring of additional staff with neurological expertise to ex-
pand the Agency’s efforts to address regulatory challenges in
neurodegenerative drug development. The Committee provides an
additional $2,000,000 for the Agency to build on current efforts to
advance our scientific knowledge of neurological diseases.

149
New Era of Smarter Food Safety.—The Committee supports the
FDA’s efforts to bring together data from several agencies to iden-
tify and predict vulnerabilities in the Nation’s food supply chain
and enable the FDA to take a proactive approach to ensure food
safety and supply chain continuity to prevent and respond to crises,
such as the recent infant formula shortage. The Committee pro-
vides no less than the fiscal year 2025 level to continue this initia-
tive.
New Prior Knowledge.—The Committee is aware of certain issues
with domestic drug manufacturing supply chains, and that the
FDA has been previously encouraged to improve generic drug de-
velopment, manufacturing, and quality of generic drugs domesti-
cally. The Committee urges the FDA to establish a pilot program
that will apply new tools to improve generic drug development,
manufacturing, and quality. The program must be in collaboration
with academic institutions that offer strengths in assessing and im-
proving the generic drug supply chain to ensure the utilization of
evidence-based best practices.
New Alternative Methods.—The Committee strongly supports the
FDA initiatives to reduce, refine and replace animal testing and
advance new alternative methods [NAMs] and appreciates the
Science Board to the FDA’s report on Potential Approaches to
Drive Future Integration of NAMs for Regulatory Decision-Making.
The Committee acknowledges that NAMs, including in vitro tests
and computational models, may represent cost-effective, reliable,
and human-relevant advances to support safety and efficacy testing
of pharmaceuticals. To encourage the use of NAMs by industry, the
FDA is directed to revise its regulations to make clear where appli-
cable that animal toxicology tests are not required to support clin-
ical testing in humans. The FDA must provide a written report to
the Committee describing progress toward implementing Science
Board recommendations and revising regulations within 1 year of
enactment of this act. The agency should limit funding to carry out
new animal testing to situations in which comparisons between an
animal method and alternative methods are scientifically necessary
and use existing animal data and alternative methods that will re-
duce animal use in research when human data is not available.
Niemann-Pick Type C [NPC].—The Committee continues to en-
courage the FDA to increase its understanding and focus on NPC,
a rare progressive and universally fatal disease that impact chil-
dren and young adults. The Committee encourages the FDA to use
its existing authorities and pathways to meet the urgent unmet
medical need of the current generation of NPC patients, including
preserving access to existing experimental therapies already in use.
The Committee further encourages the FDA to maximize the use
of existing natural history data and real world evidence contributed
by this small patient population through existing and past clinical
studies and to continue to work with patients, scientists, and in-
dustry partners to bring to full fruition the work that is being ac-
complished through patient organizations, scientists, researchers,
and other to fully benefit this generation of NPC patients.
Office of Therapeutic Products.—The Committee recognizes the
FDA’s efforts with regard to rare disease and oncology pilot pro-
grams and other positive initiatives, as well as recent increases to

150
support staffing, especially within the Center for Biologics Evalua-
tion and Research and the Office of Therapeutic Products [OTP].
However, the Committee is concerned about the ability to consist-
ently achieve the desired level of review timeliness and quality,
and encourages the FDA to implement and apply modern ap-
proaches to keep pace with the science. Specifically, the Committee
encourages OTP to facilitate reviewers’ understanding of the cur-
rent scientific consensus and disease-specific considerations for cur-
rent and future programs through consultation with subject matter
experts, both internal and external to the FDA. The Committee is
also concerned about insufficient patient and expert input when
weighing benefits and risks of potentially life changing or lifesaving
new treatments. Further, the Committee is concerned that despite
Congress recently reinforcing the FDA’s flexibilities and toolkit re-
lated to rare disease and unmet need, OTP is not fully utilizing
these flexibilities and tools as Congress intended. The Committee
notes the importance of use of these flexibilities and tools, as ap-
propriate, and expects a briefing to the Committee on interim
measures of progress within 1 year of enactment.
OIG Report on Infant Formula.—The Committee is concerned by
the findings of the HHS Office of Inspector General’s report on the
FDA’s response to the infant formula crisis (A–01–22–01502). The
Committee directs the FDA to provide the Committee with quar-
terly briefings on changes the FDA has made as a result of the
findings to improve inspections, recalls, and administrative re-
sponses within the FDA. The Committee also directs the FDA to
provide a report, within 90 days of enactment of this act, outlining
any statutory changes needed to fully implement the findings from
the report.
Over-the-Counter Tests.—The Committee remains concerned for
Americans lacking equitable access to health care. Diagnostics have
proven to be a critical component in protecting public health-miti-
gating the spread of infectious disease, as well as informing treat-
ment options- still access remains limited. The Committee is aware
of existing over-the-counter [OTC] diagnostic tests that would im-
prove accessibility for Americans, and encourage more frequent
testing of common infections, providing an overall benefit to public
health. Therefore, the Committee encourages the FDA to prioritize
the premarket review of OTC tests which target the most common
viral and bacterial threats, particularly to address infections for
which there is no OTC diagnostic currently authorized, when they
meet the FDA’s standards. Additionally, the Committee directs
that no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act, the
agency provides a report on the FDA’s efforts to expand access to
OTC diagnostics, including an update on submissions in general for
these tests, with special attention to products that address infec-
tions for which there is no OTC diagnostic currently authorized.
Oversight Activities.—The Committee provides $1,500,000 for the
HHS Office of Inspector General specifically for oversight of the
FDA’s activities. The Committee also directs the HHS Office of In-
spector General to determine how the workforce reductions at the
Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA will affect the mission and
delivery of services by the Center as agreed to under the current
user fee agreements. Within 1 year of the enactment of this act, the

151
HHS OIG shall brief the Committees on Appropriations in the Sen-
ate and House of Representatives about their work on this topic.
Oversight on FDA Inspections.—The FDA often takes several cy-
cles of review to approve drugs and biologics that are safe and ef-
fective. Pharmaceuticals or biologics often take several review cy-
cles to be approved due to questions about the quality of their man-
ufacturing, which often takes place overseas. The Committee di-
rects the FDA to submit a report of the impact of the location of
manufacturing sites, and the FDA’s ability to conduct inspections,
on the rate of first cycle approvals.
Pacific Snapper.—The Committee includes bill language regard-
ing Pacific Snapper and directs the FDA to update its Fish and
Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance or any other rel-
evant guidance to clarify or add any additional food safety issues
that may arise due to this change within 180 days of enactment.
Patient Medication Information.—The FDA is directed to finalize
the proposed rule for Patient Medication Information [PMI] with
an option for pharmacies to deliver PMI electronically to enhance
patient choice, education, and medication adherence for prescrip-
tion drugs. This standardized information will provide patients
with clear, concise, and accessible information about their medica-
tions, including drug names, important safety information, common
side effects, and directions for use. The availability of PMI in elec-
tronic format may offer users features like adjustable text size and
language options to improve comprehension for a diverse patient
population. Importantly, patients will always have the choice of
paper information, ensuring all patients have access to their pre-
ferred format of medication information.
Pasteurized Orange Juice.—The Committee is concerned that
pests, disease and hurricanes are having a devastating impact on
Florida’s citrus growers and processors. These circumstances have
resulted in a natural decline in the Brix level for Florida’s mature
oranges, with no known adverse health consequences for con-
sumers. The Committee believes it is necessary to provide for ana-
lytical deviation in the minimum Brix level for pasteurized orange
juice to account for these naturally occurring growing conditions.
The Committee strongly encourages both USDA and the FDA to ex-
pedite work with Florida’s citrus growers and processors, and other
stakeholders as necessary, to consider additional flexibility by mod-
ernizing requirements for pasteurized orange juice that better ac-
count for naturally-occurring Brix variation.
Pathogen Reduction.—The Committee supports the FDA’s efforts
to recommend an individual risk assessment for blood donor eligi-
bility. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue studying
how to improve existing blood donation policies to advance a safe
and adequate supply of blood and reduce stigma. Further, the FDA
must prioritize further investments in pathogen reduction tech-
nologies to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections
and safeguard the blood supply.
Patient Experience Data.—The Committee supports efforts to
identify standardized approaches to collecting and analyzing pa-
tient experience data to inform clinical research design and regu-
latory reviews under the patient-focused drug development process.
The Committee encourages the FDA to make every effort to incor-

152
porate all relevant patient experience data, including from patient
advocacy organizations, across its regulatory obligations.
Pediatric Cancer.—Many rare pediatric cancers have molecular
and genetic characteristics that are unique to children, such as tu-
mors with gene fusions, embryonic tumors, germline tumors, and
many brain tumors. Developing new therapies for such rare can-
cers is difficult, leaving children with rare tumors with few or no
therapeutic options. The FDA should prioritize the development of
a public-private partnership to assume responsibility for conducting
pediatric oncology drug development programs that may not be
possible for industry to develop on its own. A January 2020 GAO
report on pediatric vouchers recommended the implementation of
‘‘a collaborative agreement to share development risk and reward
between a public or quasi public organization and one or more pri-
vate developers’’.
Pediatric Cancer International Collaboration.—The Committee
encourages the FDA to engage more formally and extensively with
international entities to promote greater collaboration between the
U.S. and international partners around pediatric cancer drug devel-
opment.
Pediatric Device Consortia Grants.—Pediatric Device Consortia
grants provide funding to assist innovators in developing medical
and surgical devices designed for the unique needs of children,
needs that often go unmet by devices currently available on the
market. The Committee is pleased that the FDA-funded Pediatric
Device Consortia have assisted in advancing the development of
more than 2,500 proposed pediatric medical devices projects since
2009.
Pediatric Labeling.—The Committee continues to be concerned
that labeling for over-the-counter [OTC] single-ingredient acetami-
nophen does not contain weight-based dosing instructions for chil-
dren ages 6 months to 2 years. The Committee is concerned that
the lack of dosing information for this vulnerable population may
lead to dosing errors, adverse events, and inadequate treatment of
fever and pain. Over a decade ago, the FDA Nonprescription Drugs
Advisory Committee and Pediatric Advisory Committee rec-
ommended weight-based dosing instructions be added to the label-
ing based on scientific data; however, the FDA has still not taken
action. The Committee directs the FDA to initiate regulatory action
to add dosing data within 180 days of the enactment of this act or
issue a report to Congress every 90 days until such regulatory ac-
tion is initiated.
Pediatric Therapies for IBD.—The Committee is concerned about
the limited FDA-approved therapies to treat children impacted by
Pediatric IBD—also known as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative coli-
tis—and the myriad challenges associated with recruiting children
into clinical trials, especially ‘‘washout’’ periods or time during
which patients must abstain from therapy to participate in trials.
The Committee is aware of the FDA efforts to address these chal-
lenges more broadly, including a recently issued final guidance on
the use of pediatric extrapolation in drug development as well as
2024 draft guidance to industry focused on developing drugs to
treat pediatric IBD. The committee notes an increased reliance on
extrapolation and other approaches to support the approval of simi-

153
lar therapies to treat other pediatric autoimmune conditions, such
as juvenile arthritis. The Committee directs the FDA to build upon
these guidance documents and to work with patient, researcher,
and therapy development stakeholders to update the draft guid-
ance document on pediatric IBD based on emerging data and col-
lective stakeholder feedback and incorporating the potential use of
other data sources, including real-world evidence [RWE], in clinical
trials for pediatric IBD.
PFAS in Cosmetics.—The Committee is concerned about the
presence of perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl [PFAS] substances in
cosmetics. The Committee directs the FDA to develop plan out-
lining research needed to inform regulatory decisionmaking, includ-
ing potential development of a proposed rule to ban intentionally
added PFAS substances in cosmetics. Not later than 90 days after
enactment, the FDA will brief the committee on the research plan,
potential regulatory options, and discuss considerations and antici-
pated challenges with issuing such a proposed rule.
Plant Based Product Labeling.—The Committee is concerned
that the current labeling practices of some plant based alternatives
to animal-derived foods have the potential to cause consumer con-
fusion. The Committee directs the FDA to conduct a study to (1)
better understand consumer’s perceptions and motivations relative
to produce composition, health attributes, and labeling, and (2) as-
sess consumer perceptions of different terms used on labeling of
plant-based alternative products. No later than 180 days after the
date of enactment of this act, the FDA shall submit to Congress,
and make publicly available online, a report on the findings of this
study.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome [PCOS].—The Committee recognizes
that there have been no FDA-approved treatments specific to PCOS
and commends the FDA for supporting the Externally-Led Patient-
Focused Drug Development [EL–PFDD] meeting on PCOS. The
Committee further encourages the FDA, based on the findings of
the EL–PFDD meeting, to work with investigators, industry, pa-
tients, practitioners, and researchers to advance the development of
safe new evidence-based therapies, diagnostics, devices, and that
address the identified needs and treatment priorities of PCOS pa-
tients.
Prioritizing U.S. Biomanufacturing of Essential Medicines and
Drugs in Shortage.—The Committee directs the FDA to prioritize
applications, including or supplements, that identify a domestic
manufacturing facility or a manufacturing facility in the territory
of a government or government agency that the FDA has deter-
mined to be capable of conducting inspections pursuant to a mutual
recognition agreement, for essential medicines as identified by the
FDA and/or products that are included, or have recently been in-
cluded, on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The FDA should prioritize
pre-approval and pre-license inspections of U.S. manufacturing fa-
cilities identified in an original application for an essential medi-
cine and pre-approval and pre-license inspections of U.S. manufac-
turing facilities newly identified in a supplement for an essential
medicine or product that is, or has recently been included, on the
FDA’s drug shortage list.

154
Promoting Domestic Manufacturing.—The Committee supports
the Agency’s work to promote the domestic manufacturing of drugs
and biological products to help bolster supply chain resiliency. The
Committee encourages the FDA to increase its efforts, consistent
with its authorities, to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to
expand and relocate drug manufacturing to the United States for
this purpose. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue pro-
grams and policies that would encourage the pharmaceutical indus-
try to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies, which could
help prompt industry to relocate foreign manufacturing to the
United States or expanding current domestic manufacturing.
Psychedelics.—The Committee recognizes the increased interest
and need to study psychedelics, including MDMA, psilocybin,
ibogaine, and 5–MeO–DMT, and their potential therapeutic effects.
The Committee encourages the FDA to work with the VA, DoD,
and NIH on leveraging clinical trials to improve our understanding
of psychedelics The Committee also encourages the FDA and VA,
DoD, and NIH to work together in developing and supporting pub-
lic-private collaborations to advance psychedelic research for thera-
peutic purposes, with the FDA maintaining its independent regu-
latory authority as an observer. The Committee requests a report
on such efforts within 180 days of enactment of this act.
Rare Diseases.—The Committee recognizes that the development
of rare disease therapies offers unique regulatory challenges, such
as the small patient populations for clinical studies, poorly under-
stood natural history, and hurdles in manufacturing and commer-
cialization. To ensure that therapies for rare diseases remain a top
priority for the FDA, the Committee notes that the Rare Disease
Innovation Hub (the Hub) serves as the FDA’s coordinating office
for engagement with rare disease stakeholders across all therapies
including drugs and biologics (including cell and gene therapies),
while coordinating closely with the FDA’s center generally respon-
sible for regulation of medical devices. The Committee requests
that the Hub continue to promulgate draft guidance regarding the
evidentiary standard established by the Drug Amendments of 1962
(Public Law 87–781) and the unique development challenges posed
by rare diseases to add to existing the FDA draft guidance’s such
as Rare Diseases: Considerations for the Development of Drugs and
Biological Products (Dec. 2023). The Committee asks that the FDA
submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the enactment of
this act, which shall include summaries of relevant charters (such
as the responsibilities of the Chair(s), required participants, and
criteria for initial populations and regulatory review) and any other
relevant information the agency deems appropriate. The Com-
mittee also supports the Hub in fully implementing the 2025 stra-
tegic agenda and to strengthen the relationship between drug, bio-
logic, and device products centers and stakeholders to address
unmet needs in rare diseases, including the lack of effective treat-
ments and limited medical options for people with rare diseases.
Rare Disease Innovation Agenda.—The Committee recognizes
that the development of rare disease therapies offers unique regu-
latory challenges, especially for the smallest patient populations.
This is due to several factors including poorly understood natural
history, challenges in identifying informative endpoints and bio-

155
markers, and for certain therapies, hurdles in manufacturing and
commercialization due to population size. To help further facilitate
the development of medical products for rare diseases with a high
unmet need, the Committee requests that within 180 days of enact-
ment, the agency develop a Rare Disease Innovation Agenda to en-
hance communication between the rare disease community and the
Agency and to focus on intercenter collaboration and coordination
regarding issues critical to rare disease drug development, such as
novel endpoints, biomarker development, use of real world data,
and innovative clinical trial designs for small populations. In devel-
oping such an agenda, the Agency should consider whether dif-
ferent mechanisms could be operationalized to facilitate and en-
hance intercenter collaboration, as well as solicit public input, in-
cluding through a public meeting that includes patients, companies
developing rare disease therapies and other relevant experts. A
summary of such meeting and proposed recommendations shall be
posted on the Agency’s website.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program [RPD
PRV].—The RPD PRV program was established in 2012 and is a
longstanding bipartisan priority that has resulted in discovery, de-
livery, and development of treatments for rare pediatric diseases.
The program serves as a critical, cost-neutral incentive for pharma-
ceutical companies to develop treatments for rare pediatric diseases
and enables faster access to life-saving therapies for children with
rare conditions. The Committee anticipates that this program will
be reauthorized in 2025 and directs the FDA to maintain its focus
on rare pediatric disease therapies and continue supporting the
PRV program framework until reauthorization occurs.
Recommendations on Hemp.—The Committee recognizes the
growing consumer demand for American-made hemp products fol-
lowing the expanded legalization of hemp under the Agriculture
Improvement Act of 2018. As the industry continues to innovate
and expand to meet consumer demand, the Committee acknowl-
edges the need for clear, science-based guidance to ensure product
safety, consumer confidence, and regulatory clarity. To support this
effort, the Committee directs the FDA to solicit information from
and engage with industry stakeholders, including small businesses,
scientists, manufacturers, public health experts, academic research-
ers, and other relevant parties in the hemp community on sug-
gested limits on the amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol or other
cannabinoids in hemp-derived cannabinoid products for the pur-
poses of promulgating regulations pursuant to authorities under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq).
The Committee also encourages the FDA to seek out information
from States on actions taken to address consumer safety concerns
like cannabinoid limits and age restrictions. The FDA shall brief
the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this act on planned
engagement and requests for information.
Medical Device Remanufacturing.—The Committee is aware of
the FDA’s work on medical device remanufacturing and servicing
requirements, including the May 2024 final guidance, and directs
the agency to provide a report detailing the agency’s efforts to im-
plement the guidance. The report should outline outreach efforts
that the FDA has undertaken to inform independent servicers (who

156
aren’t FDA-regulated and may not monitor Federal Register no-
tices) about their responsibilities, including industry group commu-
nications and trade publication education. The report should also
cover the FDA’s surveillance of servicers and remanufacturers to
ensure proper documentation of remanufacturing determinations
(this shall include a summary of conducted inspections and enforce-
ment actions taken). Additionally, the report should include data
on whether the guidance has increased establishment registrations
or 510(k) submissions by remanufacturers and explain how the
FDA is addressing concerns that the guidance might be misinter-
preted to permit unsupervised device modifications by third par-
ties, emphasizing independent servicers’ understanding of their
regulatory obligations. The Committee expects the report to be
completed within 90 days of enactment with all relevant informa-
tion posted on the FDA’s public website.
Operation Stork Speed.—The Committee supports the goals of
Operation Stork Speed [OSS] to improve the safety and availability
of infant formula. The Committee urges the FDA to act swiftly to
establish and enforce clear, consistent inspection and compliance
standards for all infant formula products, regardless of their coun-
try of origin. Absent this regulatory alignment, the market risks
being disrupted by products that fall short of the high standards
set by OSS and the FDA. The Committee maintains that all manu-
facturers, whether domestic or foreign, should be held to the same
regulatory standards, requirements, and inspection levels, includ-
ing surprise inspections, to ensure a safe and transparent domestic
infant formula supply chain.
Orphan Products Grant Program.—The Committee is aware of
continued advancements in the number of therapies in develop-
ment for rare disease patients but notes that 95 percent of rare dis-
eases do not have FDA-approved treatments. The Committee recog-
nizes the importance of the Orphan Products Grant Program, com-
prised of the Clinical Trials Grant Program and the Natural His-
tory Studies Grants Program. The Committee directs the FDA to
move forward in soliciting and supporting research to address rare
disease regulatory science challenges.
Safe and Effective Products.—The Committee recognizes the
FDA’s continued efforts to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
products for U.S. patients. The Committee strongly supports FDA’s
ongoing adherence to the statutory limits on compounded copies of
medicines once an FDA approved safe and effective medicine is oth-
erwise available. The demand for certain products, including
incretin medications, should be addressed with FDA-approved safe
and effective treatments, as required by law, unless the FDA has
declared a shortage and authorized a temporary, alternative source
to meet individual needs. At the same time, the Committee under-
stands the need for continued access to compounded medications
when commercially available drugs can not meet a patient’s specific
needs; including in circumstances where a prescriber has deter-
mined that an individual patient requires a formulation change
that makes a medically significant difference in line with section
503A of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act. The Committee remains
concerned that unapproved and misbranded drugs are being im-
ported illegally and directs the FDA to coordinate closely with U.S.

157
Customs and Border Protection and other partners to prevent un-
approved and misbranded drugs from entering the market, thereby
upholding regulatory standards and safeguarding the drug supply
chain to protect patient health. The Committee directs the FDA to
provide to the Committee a briefing, no later than 60 days after the
enactment of this act highlighting the FDA’s comprehensive ap-
proach to prevent the distribution of unapproved and misbranded
incretin medications into the supply chain to avoid harm to patient
safety.
School Nutrition Grants to Combat Chronic Disease.—The Com-
mittee provides $10,000,000 within the Human Foods Program
funding to support the FDA Commissioner’s priority to combat the
chronic disease crisis in the United States through a pilot grant
program to help schools transition to healthier foods to ensure the
children of our Nation are served nutritious food; including equip-
ment purchases to facilitate food made on premises and procuring
more local, fresh produce.
Shrimp Imports.—The Committee is concerned that the FDA is
not taking adequate measures to prevent the importation of shrimp
contaminated with antimicrobial resistant pathogens such as sal-
monella. The FDA’s reporting shows a massive decline in the
amount of entry lines of shrimp refused for the presence of sal-
monella even as the volume of shrimp imports have substantially
increased, outbreaks of illness from salmonella have been tied to
imported shrimp, and the agency has confirmed antibiotic resist-
ance in salmonella found in shrimp imports. Further, the FDA’s
Import Alerts 16–18 and 16–35 reflect a lack of care and attention
to the identification of companies exporting shrimp to the United
States without being detained without physical examination. The
bill provides that no funds shall be used to add any firms to these
Import Alerts until the FDA ensures that firms added to the Green
List have resolved the conditions that gave rise to the appearance
of the violation. In addition, the FDA will submit a report on the
steps taken by the agency to confirm that Import Alerts 16–18 and
16–35 correctly identify existing producers that are not subject to
Detention Without Physical Examination and are able to ade-
quately demonstrate that the firm has resolved the conditions that
gave rise to the appearance of the violation. The Committee directs
the FDA to submit this report to the Committee within 180 days
of enactment of this act and include a summary of the agency’s ac-
tions to prevent the entry of shrimp contaminated with filth, de-
composition, or harmful pathogens (such as salmonella) into the
United States.
State and Local Inspections.—Of the total amount appropriated
for the Human Foods Program and related field activities in the Of-
fice of Inspections and Investigations, no less than $116,000,000
shall be used for State and local programs.
Seafood Labeling.—The Committee continues to hear concerns
with the labeling of certain foods as a fish or seafood product when
the products are highly-processed plant-based foods rather than de-
rived from actual fish or seafood, and the labeling of these products
are misleading, deceptive, and confusing to consumers. The Com-
mittee is concerned the terms ‘‘plant-based’’ and ‘‘vegan’’ exempt
the producer from describing the actual plant source as part of the

158
product name, in opposition to other FDA guidance. The Committee
directs the FDA to provide clarity around the labeling of these
foods using seafood terminology to ensure they are held to the
same standards as actual seafood products to avoid consumer con-
fusion and aligns with the structure it has applied to the draft
guidance for the labeling of plant-based milk alternatives.
Securing Medical Supply Chains.—The Committee direct the
FDA, in coordination with national security agencies, to prioritize
supply chain security and national security when evaluating all ap-
plications throughout the new drug development and approval
lifecycle.
Smoking Cessation Treatments for Youth and Adults.—The Com-
mittee continues to recognize the important work of advancing
smoking cessation treatment innovation to help adult smokers be
more successful in quitting and the critical role of the Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research [CDER] in this work. The Com-
mittee further acknowledges the agency’s October 2024 public
meeting on advancing smoking cessation innovation which under-
scored the importance of bringing forward new pharmacotherapies
for smokers seeking to quit and the key opportunity for CDER to
be more modern and efficient in its work in this area. The Com-
mittee strongly encourages CDER to do more to modernize the reg-
ulatory framework for these products to reflect the real-world expe-
rience risk-benefit considerations, address unnecessary barriers to
advancing vitally needed new cessation therapies for patients, and
encourage smoking cessation pharmacotherapy innovation on be-
half of our Nation’s patients. The Committee requests an update
from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on new actions CDER
will take to address the Committee’s concerns not later than 90
days after enactment of this act.
The Committee is aware of alarming trends in youth e-cigarette
use; recent survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention indicates that in 2024, nearly 8 percent of high school
students reported e-cigarette use in the previous 30 days. At
present, there are no FDA-approved nicotine cessation drugs that
are approved for adolescent populations. With more than 2.5 mil-
lion young people using e-cigarettes, there is a need for develop-
ment of nicotine cessation treatments in adolescents. The Com-
mittee encourages the FDA to provide additional guidance to drug
manufacturers on the tools that the FDA can utilize to promote de-
velopment and expedite approval of nicotine cessation treatments
in adolescents.
Sodium.—The Committee recognizes the importance of reducing
sodium in the food supply. Within 90 days of enactment, the Com-
mittee directs the FDA to provide a report to the Committee on its
preliminary assessment report that will be publicly posted to its
website and on its plans for monitoring and evaluation of the short-
term targets. In its report, the FDA should detail how it will iden-
tify data sources, collect and analyze data, create a timeline for as-
sessments, and work with industry on voluntary compliance.
Sponsor Communication.—The Committee is concerned with the
FDA’s reliance on ‘‘Written Response Only’’ communication, in lieu
of live interactions when responding to meeting requests from
sponsors. While written response can be a useful tool, there are

159
times where meaningful scientific exchanges between sponsors and
the FDA is required. The Committee directs the FDA to offer face
to face or teleconference meetings when requested by the sponsor,
as discussed in the FDA’s guidance documents.
State and Regulatory Frameworks and Adequacy of Current Pow-
ers.—The Committee urges the FDA to improve data sharing and
coordination between State and Federal authorities, such as by
continuing to support the FDA’s Cannabinoid Hemp Product 20.88
Information Sharing Agreement initiative.
Steroid Use.—The Committee is encouraged that the FDA is con-
tinuing to progress in its risk benefit analysis of new treatments
for diseases, particularly rare diseases, with high unmet need and
a current standard of care that carries a potential risk, especially
for children who may be taking these higher risk treatments over
many years. The Committee applauds the FDA for applying
thoughtfulness and urgency when reviewing new treatment options
that are both effective treatment options and could mitigate the po-
tential long-term risk of the current standard of care. As the Agen-
cy continues to address risks such as radiation exposure in cancer
treatments, prolonged exposure to addictive treatments, and other
current treatments that carry potential risk along with benefit, the
Committee supports the Agency in applying the same urgency to
addressing the risk of prolonged exposure to high dose steroids,
particularly for children.
Sunscreen.—The Committee is concerned that Americans are
falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to access to sun-
screen even though skin cancer is the most common cancer in the
U.S. According to the Surgeon General, more than five million
Americans each year are treated for skin cancer at a cost of over
eight billion dollars per year. As a result, the Committee directs
the FDA to work with stakeholders to harmonize its approach with
international testing standards to ensure Americans have access to
as many sunscreen active ingredients as possible recognizing that
safe and effective sunscreen products are a proven preventative
tool against skin cancer. In addition, the Committee urges the FDA
to utilize its authorities provided under the CARES Act to evaluate
new sunscreen ingredients already approved for use around the
world and to educate stakeholders about the administrative order
process to encourage research and development of new sunscreen
technology.
Supply Shortages for Critical Medications.—The Committee is
concerned about continued reports of supply shortages for critical
medications and devices, including diabetes, cancer, antibiotic,
ADHD, and other drug shortages, which continue to pose a signifi-
cant challenge and affect patients access to vital treatments and
care. Within 90 days of enactment, the Committee requests a re-
port from the FDA regarding its implementation of shortage-re-
lated authorities, and the status of shortage related guidance docu-
ments.
Temporomandibular Disorder.—The Committee encourages the
FDA to support the development and implementation of a Patient-
Centered Coordinated Registry Network [CRN] for
Temporomandibular Joint Disorder [TMD]. This Registry will be a
critical component in the transformation of temporomandibular dis-

160
order research across other Government Agencies. The Committee
supports collaborations among medical product centers related to
the development of treatments for TMD and urges the FDA to sup-
port implementing of a Temporomandibular Joint [TMJ] CRN, con-
tinuing the developmental work of the TMJ Patient-led Round-
Table and its partners in successfully developing the Registry as an
important tool in ongoing efforts to improve the treatment and
management of TMD patients.
Timing and Sequencing of Cancer Immunotherapy.—The Com-
mittee commends the FDA for supporting the rapid implementation
of life-saving immunotherapies into the clinic. New data suggest
the administration of immunotherapies early in the treatment
timeline may be able to prevent or intercept cancers before they de-
velop into serious disease, thus improving patient outcomes while
simultaneously reducing monetary costs and physical burden. To
support continued research in this area, the field must develop
novel tools to efficiently run early-stage clinical trials. These tools
include biomarkers that can detect early disease, inform appro-
priate treatments, and/or serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints.
In addition, determination of early-stage clinical trial endpoints at
large that can characterize patient benefit are necessary for contin-
ued momentum. Therefore, the Committee urges the FDA to pro-
vide guidance on the development of early disease clinical trial
tools, including early-stage biomarkers and clinical endpoints.
Tissue Transplants.—The Committee notes the tissue transplant
industry is growing, with approximately 58,000 donors providing
tissue allografts for 2.5 million transplants in the United States
each year. Although products in this space are widely used for pa-
tients and healthcare providers, the Committee notes outbreaks of
M. tuberculosis in 2021 and 2023 that has contaminated over 100
bone-allograft HCT/Ps placed in patients, resulting in adverse
events and negative patient outcomes. The Committee requests the
FDA issue guidance identifying M. tuberculosis as a relevant com-
municable disease agent or disease [RCDAD] and providing rec-
ommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of M. tuber-
culosis.
Traceability Rule.—The Committee directs that no funding from
this act or any other act may be used by the FDA to delay enforce-
ment of the Food Traceability Final Rule (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart
S) beyond July 20, 2028. The FDA shall take all necessary meas-
ures to ensure that full compliance and enforcement begin no later
than that date. The FDA shall submit a report to the Committees
on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate
within 60 days of the enactment of this act detailing its strategies
to support industry implementation and to prepare for the FDA’s
enforcement of the Food Traceability Final Rule by July 20, 2028.
The report shall include specific performance milestones (including
progress toward operationalization of FDA’s internal Product Trac-
ing System) and an inspections and compliance roadmap and shall
describe technical assistance provided to industry. The FDA shall
submit progress updates every 90 days thereafter until the rule is
in effect. Failure to submit these reports shall not delay the July
20, 2028, enforcement date.

161
Transparency for Imaging Technology.—Foreign adversaries are
pursuing the collection and exploitation of Americans’ sensitive
health data through medical equipment. Therefore, the Committee
directs the FDA to provide a report regarding the authorization of
all medical imaging technology for sale into the United States from
entities that are based in a territory of a foreign adversary, as de-
fined in 15 CFR 7.4, or under the jurisdiction of a foreign adver-
saries’ laws or regulations, to the degree that the FDA has the in-
formation and based on the most current information in the FDA’s
databases of premarket authorizations and Establishment Reg-
istration & Device Listings. ‘‘Medical imaging technology’’ refers to
any device, software, or other technology intended for use in med-
ical imaging, including but not limited to X-ray, MRI, CT,
ultrasound, and other diagnostic or therapeutic imaging modalities.
Type 1 Diabetes.—The Committee directs $5,000,000 to be spent
within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research [CBER]
within the FDA to prioritize the development and validation of im-
proved endpoints for clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies in
type 1 diabetes (T1D), with a specific focus on C-peptide as a poten-
tial surrogate endpoint. The agency should engage with relevant
stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and patient advo-
cacy groups, to evaluate the merits of C-peptide as a surrogate end-
point and its potential to accelerate the development of disease-
modifying therapies for T1D. Furthermore, the FDA is directed to
provide clear guidance to drug developers and relevant stake-
holders on the appropriate use of C-peptide in clinical trials and
take the necessary steps to consider its acceptance as a validated
surrogate endpoint for demonstrating efficacy in T1D therapies.
The Committee believes that improving and expanding the range
of acceptable endpoints, particularly through the validation of C-
peptide, could significantly expedite the development and approval
of innovative treatments for T1D, ultimately leading to improved
patient outcomes and reduced disease burden. The FDA is required
to report back to the Committee within 180 days on its progress
in this area, including the specific steps taken to incorporate C-
peptide or other novel endpoints into the regulatory pathway for
T1D therapies.
User Fee Agreements.—Biopharmaceutical, medical device, and
other medical product developers pay user fees to the FDA to en-
sure the agency has the resources and staffing needed for timely
review of new and generic product applications, with an overall
goal of shortening the time it takes for patients to access new safe
and effective treatments in the United States. This statutory
framework was developed for patients, to ensure that the FDA’s
medical product reviews occur in an efficient and predictable man-
ner, while also supplementing the government resources, which has
been successful for decades. As the FDA undergoes its current reor-
ganization and staffing changes, it is imperative that the user fee
money provided to the FDA is used in the manner intended and
outlined in the user fee commitment letters which were passed by
Congress and signed into law. This includes the agency maintain-
ing the appropriate level of user-fee funded staff and other re-
sources. To ensure the user fee programs operate as intended, sec-
tion 779 of the bill directs the FDA to provide a report, validated

162
by the FDA Ombudsman, within 90 days of the enactment of this
act, outlining how the FDA is ensuring that the user fee agree-
ments are fully maintained and implemented, including details as
to the current level of staff and other resources devoted to user fee
commitments. Following the initial 90-day assessment, section 779
of the bill directs the FDA Ombudsman to certify quarterly staffing
and user fee spending for the FDA’s reporting to the Committee.
Valley Fever.—The Committee is encouraged by progress made
toward producing a Valley Fever vaccine and recommends that the
FDA consult with the public and obtain input on the state of the
science related to vaccines to prevent Valley Fever. The Committee
further recommends that the FDA draft and issue industry guid-
ance for entities seeking approval under the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or licensure under section
351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) of antifungal
therapies to treat Valley Fever.
Vibrio.—The Committee is aware of the public health challenge
related to the naturally occurring bacteria called Vibrio
parahaemolyticus that can accumulate in shellfish and believes
that more scientific research is necessary to develop proper controls
that will reduce the risk to consumers and sustain a healthy do-
mestic shellfish industry. The Committee encourages the FDA to
increase funding for research into Vibrio illnesses associated with
the consumption of raw molluscan shellfish, improve risk assess-
ment models, and develop improved rapid detection methods for
virulent Vibrio strains.
Women in Clinical Research.—Following recommendations by the
Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating
Women, the Committee urges the agency to issue final regulations
relating to the protection of human subjects, including parts 50 and
56 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, with the latest regula-
tions of the Department of Health and Human Services relating to
the inclusion of pregnant women as subjects in clinical research.
The agency should consider further guidance about ethical issues
to be considered and strategies for designing ethical studies, to in-
form the inclusion of pregnant women and lactating women in a
clinical trial and facilitate their participation.
Women’s Health.—The Committee recognizes that women’s
health includes conditions and diseases that differently, dispropor-
tionately and/or solely impact the health of women. The Committee
directs the FDA to prioritize professional expertise in women’s biol-
ogy and innovation to facilitate a timely in the approval process,
ensure clinical trial design is representative of disease impact in
the broader population, and accelerate bringing medical innova-
tions to women.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriations, 2025 ............................................................................. $5,000,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 5,000,000
The FDA maintains offices and staff in 49 States and in the Dis-
trict of Columbia and Puerto Rico, including field laboratories and
specialized facilities, as well as the National Center for Toxi-
cological Research complex. Repairs, modifications, improvements,
and construction to the FDA headquarters and field facilities must

163
be made to preserve the properties, ensure employee safety, meet
changing program requirements, and permit the agency to keep its
laboratory methods up to date.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $5,000,000 for
the FDA buildings and facilities.
This funding shall be used to upgrade the FDA’s facilities and
laboratories which are currently below public safety standards and
incapable of performing agency requirements. The Committee is
aware that several FDA-owned facilities need significant renova-
tions and repairs. The Committee understands that high-quality,
reliable buildings are a necessity to support the FDA’s mission-crit-
ical work.
INDEPENDENT AGENCY
FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Limitation, 2025..................................................................................... $100,425,000
Committee recommendation ................................................................. 106,500,000
The Farm Credit Administration [FCA] is the independent agen-
cy in the executive branch of the Government responsible for the
examination and regulation of the banks, associations, and other
institutions of the Farm Credit System.
Activities of FCA include the planning and execution of examina-
tions of Farm Credit System institutions and the preparation of ex-
amination reports. FCA also promulgates regulations, establishes
standards, enforces rules and regulations, and approves certain ac-
tions of the institutions.
The administration and the institutions under its jurisdiction
now operate under authorities contained in the Farm Credit Act of
1971 (Public Law 92–181), effective December 10, 1971. Public Law
99–205, effective December 23, 1985, restructured FCA and gave
the agency regulatory authorities and enforcement powers.
The act provides for the farmer-owned cooperative system to
make sound, adequate, and constructive credit available to farmers
and ranchers and their cooperatives, rural residences, and associa-
tions and other entities upon which farming operations are depend-
ent, and to modernize existing farm credit law to meet current and
future rural credit needs.
The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–233) au-
thorized the formation of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Cor-
poration [FAMC] to operate a secondary market for agricultural
and rural housing mortgages. FCA, under section 8.11 of the Farm
Credit Act of 1971 (Public Law 92–181), as amended, is assigned
the responsibility of regulating this entity and assuring its safe and
sound operation.
Expenses of FCA are paid by assessments collected from the
Farm Credit System institutions and by assessments to the FAMC.

DISCLOSURE OF CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
ITEMS
The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse.μ
The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the
decisions on how to allocate the people’s money. As defined in Rule
XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term ‘‘congression-
ally directed spending item’’ means a provision or report language
included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, author-
izing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget
authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a con-
tract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expendi-
ture with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or
congressional district, other than through a statutory or adminis-
trative, formula-driven, or competitive award process. For each
item, a Member is required to provide a certification that neither
the Member nor the Member’s immediate family has a pecuniary
interest in such congressionally directed spending item. Such cer-
tifications are available to the public on the website of the Senate
Committee on Appropriations (https://www.appropriations.senate.
gov/congressionally-directed-spending-requests). Following is a list
of congressionally directed spending items included in the Senate
recommendation discussed in this report, along with the name of
each Senator who submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdic-
tion for each item so identified. Neither the Committee rec-
ommendation nor this report contains any limited tax benefits or
limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV.
