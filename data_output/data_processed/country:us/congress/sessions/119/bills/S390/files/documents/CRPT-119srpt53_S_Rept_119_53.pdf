BRIDGING AGENCY DATA GAPS AND ENSURING SAFETY
(BADGES) FOR NATIVE COMMUNITIES ACT
JULY31, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Ms. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Indian Affairs,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 390]
The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill
(S. 390), to require Federal law enforcement agencies to report on
cases of missing or murdered Indians, and for other purposes, hav-
ing considered the same, reports favorably thereon without amend-
ment, and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE
The purpose of S. 390 is to improve public safety and justice in
Indian country by improving data collection and sharing between
Tribal, federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, address-
ing barriers to investigating missing and murdered Indigenous per-
sons, and addressing federal inefficiencies in background checks to
expedite and streamline the hiring process of Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs (BIA) and Tribal law enforcement agencies to help with re-
cruitment and retention in Indian Country.
BACKGROUND AND NEED
At least 240 Tribes directly operate their own police departments
to provide public safety services to their communities,1 while others
rely on federally-operated BIA police departments or state and
local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) pursuant to P.L. 83–280.2

jurisdiction over federal Indian lands to the state governments of California, Minnesota, Ne-

This complicated law enforcement network makes collecting and
sharing criminal justice data in Indian country challenging. For ex-
ample, criminal case information is fragmented and compartmen-
talized between different LEA data systems, particularly federal
LEA systems such as the National Crime Information Center
(NCIC), which is operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System
(NamUs), which is operated by the National Institute of Justice
(NIJ).3 While the databases are not prohibited from communicating
with one another for cases of missing adults and children following
enactment of Help Find the Missing Act (‘‘Billy’s Law’’)4 in 2022,
participation in these two reporting systems is optional, creating
data gaps and access issues for federal, Tribal, state and local
LEAs.5 Further, only Tribes participating in the Tribal Access Pro-
gram have access to these systems.6 As such, LEAs may be unable
to access missing persons case information pertaining to Tribal
members, for cases occurring on Tribal lands, or for cases of inter-
est to Tribes.
Hiring law enforcement officers requires thorough background
checks and security clearances, which can be slow and cum-
bersome, especially when the BIA must rely on the Office of Per-
sonnel Management to conduct the required background checks for
federal employment.7 The lengthy and complex hiring processes for
federal law enforcement can discourage applicants and can leave
law enforcement positions unfilled for months or years. Improving
the hiring processes by streamlining the background check process
would help as part of a multi-faceted approach to increase recruit-
ment and retention of law enforcement across Indian country. S.
390 authorizes the BIA, through its Office of Justice Services
(OJS), to carry out a demonstration program to conduct back-
ground investigations and security clearance determinations for
BIA law enforcement positions. Currently, BIA OJS is authorized
under the Tribal Law and Order Act8 to conduct background
checks for only Tribal law enforcement and corrections officers
upon request from a Tribe with a 638 self-determination contract
or self-governance compact under the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA).

Act, 2018 to require state and Tribal government to report to the federal criminal background
check database. 34 U.S.C. §40901(b)(1). Prior to that, Congress enacted the National Child
Search Assistance Act of 1990 which requires state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies
to immediately input information about abducted children into the FBI’s National Crime Infor-
mation Center. 34 U.S.C. §41307.

lenges. NOTINVISIBLEACTCOMM’N, NOTONEMORE: FINDINGSANDRECOMMENDATIONS(2023).

Committee.
In the 118th Congress, a similar bill, S. 465, was introduced by

Rounds later joined as a cosponsor. The Committee held a hearing
on S. 465 on May 1, 2024 (S. Hrg. 118–406). The Committee, in an
open business meeting on September 25, 2024, by a majority voice
vote of a quorum present, ordered S. 465, favorably reported, with
an amendment in the nature of a substitute, by voice vote (S. Rept.
118–244). The Senate passed S. 465, as amended, by voice vote on
December 16, 2024.
A companion bill, H.R. 1292, was introduced by Representatives
Gallego (D–AZ), Davids (D–KS), and Newhouse (R–WA) in the
House of Representatives on March 1, 2023. Representatives Kil-
mer (D–WA), Cole (R–OK), and Molinaro (R–NY) later joined as co-
sponsors. On March 1, 2023, the House referred the bill to the Ju-
diciary Committee, to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, to
the Committee on Natural Resources, and to the Oversight and Ac-
countability Committee. On March 10, 2023, the bill was further
referred to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on
Health. On March 22, 2023, the bill was further referred to the
House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Af-
fairs.
COST AND BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS
The Committee has requested, but has not yet received, the Con-
gressional Budget Office’s estimate of the cost of S. 390 as ordered
reported. When the Congressional Budget Office completes its cost
estimate, it will be posted on the Internet at www.cbo.gov, and
printed in the Congressional Record.
REGULATORY AND PAPERWORK IMPACT STATEMENT
Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the regu-
latory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in carrying
out the bill. The Committee believes that S. 390, as reported, will
have minimal impact on regulatory or paperwork requirements.
EXECUTIVE TESTIMONY AND COMMUNICATIONS
The testimony provided by the U.S. Department of the Interior
from the May 1, 2024 hearing on S.465 follows:
Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Mur-
kowski, and members of the Committee. My name is
Bryan Newland, and I am the Assistant Secretary for In-
dian Affairs at the Department of the Interior (Depart-
ment). Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony
on S. 465, ‘‘Bridging Agency Data Gaps and Ensuring Safe-
ty (BADGES) for Native Communities Act’’ . . .

under the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act, as amend-
ed by the Tribal Law and Order Act (25 U.S.C.
§2802(c)(16)(C)), to include criminal investigators, medical
examiners, coroners, and forensic investigators. Section
102 would also add infrastructure and capital needs for
Tribal police and court facilities, including evidence stor-
age and processing, to the required data for the annual re-
port.
Section 201 would establish a five-year demonstration
program that allows the Secretary, in coordination with
the Director of BIA, to conduct or adjudicate personnel
background investigations and security clearances for BIA
law enforcement officers (LEOs). The BIA OJS currently
assists Indian Tribes in conducting background investiga-
tions for Tribal LEOs and welcomes the demonstration
program as it would assist BIA in eliminating one of the
biggest obstacles to recruitment—the lengthy background
investigation process—and result in the expedited hiring of
qualified LEOs. The Department strongly supports this
provision.
Section 204, titled ‘‘BIA and Tribal Law Enforcement Of-
ficer Counseling Resources Interdepartmental Coordina-
tion,’’ would require the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, the Attorney General, and the Director of BIA
OJS to ensure that Federal training materials and mental
health wellness programs are available for Indian Country
LEOs. These much-needed resources would help ensure
that BIA and Tribal LEOs have access to the mental
health resources they need when they experience occupa-
tional stress.
The Department supports the goals of S. 465 as they
align with important Administration priorities of improv-
ing public safety and justice in Indian Country. The De-
partment defers to the Department of Justice on provisions
pertaining to its programs . . .
Conclusion
Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and mem-
bers of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to
provide the Department’s views.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In the opinion of the Committee, it is necessary to dis-
pense with subsection 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate to expedite the business of the Senate.
