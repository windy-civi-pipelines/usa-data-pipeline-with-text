PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
Introduced on January 28, 2025, by Representative Andy Barr,
H.R. 747, the Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act of 2025, would amend the
definition of ‘‘foreign opioid trafficker’’ to specify the term includes
certain Chinese entities and government officials who fail to take
steps to prevent opioid trafficking, subjecting them to sanctions.
The bill would also require the President to determine whether cer-
tain Chinese government officials qualify as foreign opioid traf-
fickers, and it would extend the applicability of the Fentanyl Sanc-
tions Act.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Per the Drug Enforcement Agency, drug overdoses have officially
become the leading cause of death of Americans aged 18–45, with
fentanyl responsible for nearly 70% of the total overdoses.1 Illicit
fentanyl is typically supplied and trafficked to the U.S. by Mexican-
1DEA Operation Engage, https://www.dea.gov/engage/operation-engage-spokane (last visited
Feb. 13, 2025).

based transnational criminal organizations,2 with China serving as
the primary source for the financing and trafficking services of
fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances (such as precursors).3
Mexican drug cartels such as the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion
(CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel are primarily responsible for the
supply of fentanyl into the U.S. through the porous southwestern
border. Chinese labs serve as the illicit manufacturer of ‘‘fentanyl
analogs and precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl . . . [that
are] then sold on the Darknet and shipped in bulk to the U.S. and
Mexico.’’4 Generally, the two ways fentanyl is trafficked into the
U.S. by China are:
1. U.S. individuals directly purchase fentanyl from China for
personal use or domestic distribution (via Darknet), or
2. Fentanyl and/or other fentanyl-laced drugs are cross-bor-
der trafficked into the U.S. by Mexican-based transnational
criminal organizations or other smaller networks that have re-
ceived the drug from China.5
This bill ensures that Chinese entities and government officials
are held accountable by the U.S. if they take part in the manufac-
turing, financing, or distribution of fentanyl. Expanding the defini-
tion ‘‘foreign opioid trafficker’’ to include these Chinese entities and
officials allows for a more targeted approach at dismantling Chi-
nese money laundering networks, given their prominent role in fa-
cilitating the fentanyl crisis in American communities.
