COMMITTEE COMMENTS AND DIRECTION
Prioritization of open source information related to PRC develop-
ment finance and influence abroad
For several years, the Committee has pushed the IC to utilize
commercially available information to track the PRC’s financial ac-
tivity that undermines U.S. interests, ranging from investments in
critical technologies, to creating monopolies through beneficial own-
ership, to growing influence abroad through financing of infrastruc-
ture projects. This committee has been particularly focused on PRC
infrastructure investments in partner countries that pressure gov-
ernments to take policy positions in opposition to U.S. positions,
such as recognition of Taiwan.
However, the IC has struggled to identify and utilize open source
data to track such PRC malign influence activity abroad. Open
source data sets tracking 20,985 PRC development finance projects
across 165 countries supported by grant and loan commitments
worth $1.34 trillion are now available. This information covers all
regions, sectors, and sources and types of financial and in-kind
transfers from government and state-owned institutions in China.
Therefore, given the availability of commercially available infor-
mation that can inform analysis related to PRC malign influence
activity abroad, the Committee directs the DNI to coordinate with
heads of relevant IC agencies, including the CIA, to prioritize col-
lection of reliable, detailed open source information on the PRC’s
use of foreign aid, debt, and equity investments to influence out-
comes in developed and developing countries across economic, tech-
nological, political, military, intelligence, and governance domains.
Ongoing Intelligence Community Efforts to Counter Cocaine Traf-
ficking
In addition to the synthetic opioid crisis, the Committee is con-
cerned about the increasing cocaine production in South America
and its transshipment into the United States. Over the last decade,
cocaine overdose deaths among Americans have surged from nearly
5,000 in 2013 to almost 30,000 in 2023. The Committee is further
concerned about cocaine trafficking as a source of revenue for drug
trafficking organizations engaged in the production and shipment
of illicit synthetic opioids to the United States. Competition for con-
trol of the cocaine market is resulting in rising violence and insta-
bility throughout Latin America.
The Committee supports whole-of-government efforts to track
and interdict cocaine shipments to the United States and will con-
tinue to ensure appropriate that IC resources are devoted to coun-
tering cocaine trafficking.
Cryptocurrency Mining Threats to National Security

mining facilities inside the United States pose a danger to national

security. Located throughout the 50 states and equipped with ma-
chinery made by Bitmain, a privately-owned Chinese company with
ties to the CCP, these mines are located near sensitive defense in-
stallations or critical U.S. infrastructure such as power grids, cre-
ating several disturbing vulnerabilities.
First, co-location of Chinese-owned cryptocurrency mines near
sensitive defense installations gives China an opportunity to pur-
sue a full suite of intelligence collection activities against those
sites. Even if these Chinese-owned companies are not connected to
the CCP, they can be forced by the PRC to turn over data in ac-
cordance with China’s national security law. This is an unneces-
sary counterintelligence risk to sensitive defense installations.
Second, the Bitmain machines used in these facilities have the
capability to be remotely controlled by Bitmain personnel in China.
According to a New York Times article from October 13, 2023, ‘‘In
the past, researchers have found ‘back doors’’ that would have al-
lowed the company to covertly operate its equipment. After one was
discovered in 2017, the company confirmed it could have remotely
controlled its mining machines.’’ It is estimated that each mining
facility houses 10,000 machines. Considering Bitmain’s connections
to the CCP, having tens of thousands of machines whose operations
can be run from Beijing located near sensitive defense installations
is an unacceptable risk.
Lastly, it appears the majority of these Chinese mining machines
have made their way into the U.S. illegally. Customs and Border
Protection have discovered widespread customs fraud when it
comes to these machines entering the United States, to include
mis-manifestation of what these machines are and undervaluation
of their worth. It is estimated that the financial loss to the United
States government could be as much as $10 billion and growing.
Failure to address China’s blatant efforts to smuggle malicious
crypto-mining machines inside our country will undermine the
Trump administration’s policies to better balance trade with China.
There have been some efforts to address the national security
threats these Chinese-owned facilities pose. For example, one such
facility in Cheyenne, WY, located near a nuclear missile installa-
tion, was the subject of a review by the Committee on Foreign In-
vestment in the United States which led to an Executive Order
blocking the Chinese-backed firm from owning the property near
the installation in order to ‘‘protect national security.’’ While this
is a good start, the Committee believes more needs to be done to
address this egregious threat to national security.
Therefore, the Committee directs the relevant elements of the IC
to work together with law enforcement partners in an effort to shut
down any Chinese cryptocurrency mining operations that pose a
threat to national security.
Assessment of Threat posed by TikTok to the Private Personal Infor-
mation of United States Citizens
The Committee is concerned that the declassified Intelligence In-
formation Report (IIR) (IIR 4 212 7305 20) by the FBI further rein-
forces the vulnerability of U.S. personally identifiable information
(PII) posed by TikTok and other adversary-nation controlled mobile
applications. As documented in the IIR, the government of the PRC
in August 2020 collected private user data from TikTok accounts

in order to produce a large amount of fraudulent drivers’ licenses
to allow foreign nationals in the United States to vote in the 2020
election. The Committee is further concerned that the IIR was re-
called and not subsequently re-issued even after the source of the
original IIR was re-interviewed and corroborated and after 20,000
fraudulent drivers licenses were seized by U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection in 2020.
Therefore, the Committee directs the Director of the FBI, in co-
ordination with the heads of other federal agencies, as appropriate,
to submit to the congressional intelligence committees within 180
days of enactment of this Act an assessment of the threat posed by
TikTok and other foreign mobile applications to the private per-
sonal information of American citizens. Specifically, such assess-
ment shall include all information, including metadata and content,
that these applications can collect from U.S. users and for what
purposes such information can be used for.
The Committee further directs the heads of other elements of the
IC to review their holdings for information that corroborates the
TikTok reporting of the original IIR.
COVID–19 Declassification
Section 1001 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2026 directs the DNI to undertake a declassification review of in-
telligence relating to both the origins of the COVID–19 pandemic
and to efforts by the PRC to disrupt the global response to the pan-
demic. The Committee is concerned by efforts by the PRC to in-
crease its global standing in multilateral bodies, including global
health agencies, and believes that the American people and policy-
makers must have a full accounting for the PRC’s past mistakes
and malfeasance in responding to the most lethal and disruptive
global health emergency in decades. The Committee notes the im-
portant step forward of the COVID–19 Origins Act of 2023 in re-
leasing valuable information to the public on the origins of the pan-
demic, but believes more action is needed for full transparency and
accountability to occur.
Therefore, the Committee directs that in completing the declas-
sification review directed by Section 1001 of this Act, the DNI
should cooperate with the Public Interest Declassification Board, to
include delegating, as appropriate, identification of and rec-
ommendations for declassification of COVID–19-related intel-
ligence. The DNI shall retain final authority to declassify any iden-
tified intelligence and shall not permit delegated actions to super-
sede the statutory requirement to complete the declassification re-
view within 180 days after enactment of this Act.
Vetting Support Agencies
Vetting Support Agencies (VSAs) are integral to the national vet-
ting enterprise in that they are responsible for protecting the na-
tion from terrorists, threats to public safety, and threats to our na-
tional security. VSAs have seen a surge in processing as a result
of (1) additional vetting requirements arising from Executive Order
14161 and (2) increased categories of aliens needing to be vetted
through the National Vetting Center (NVC). The Committee sup-
ports the importance of processing these vetting requests in a time-

ly manner, and recognizes many IC partners supporting this mis-
sion require increased staff to meet the demand.
Therefore, the Committee recommends vetting support agencies
have adequate staffing for their caseloads, with a minimum of one
watch officer from the VSA available to support the activities of the
NVC 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.
Illicit Financing for Counternarcotics
The Committee is encouraged by the IC’s enhanced focus on il-
licit trafficking of synthetic opioids in recent years, as evidenced by
the establishment of a National Intelligence Manager for Counter-
narcotics at the ODNI and other efforts. However, despite the Com-
mittee’s repeated inquiries regarding collection, mapping, and
interdiction of entities that provide the financial infrastructure for
narcotics production and trafficking, including the use of
cryptocurrency, money laundering, and other methods, the Intel-
ligence Community has failed to demonstrate a clear focus and ef-
fort on this element of the counternarcotics mission.
Therefore, the Committee directs that, not later than 90 days
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the DNI conduct a re-
view of intelligence collection and other activities of the intelligence
community related to countering illicit financing for narcotics traf-
fickers and narcotics trafficking and submit to the congressional in-
telligence committees a report on the results of the review that in-
cludes for each element of the intelligence community, the fol-
lowing: (1) An accounting of the analytic and operational resources
of the element for countering illicit financing for narcotics traf-
ficking, including a breakdown of budgets and staffing dedicated to
countering such financing; and (2) An assessment of the intel-
ligence and resource gaps of the element related to countering il-
licit financing for narcotics trafficking.
Requirement for the Central Intelligence Agency to Implement Cer-
tain Recommendations Regarding Medical Care and Benefits
for Individuals Affected by Anomalous Health Incidents
In December 2024, the Committee’s Audits and Projects Team
issued a report examining CIA’s efforts to provide facilitated med-
ical care and benefits to individuals affected by AHIs. The Com-
mittee directs CIA to prioritize implementing the report rec-
ommendations pertaining to (1) developing written polices for all
medical care and benefit programs available to AHI reporters that
include clear eligibility criteria and adjudication processes; and (2)
developing and documenting a comprehensive and resource-in-
formed plan for how the Agency will provide, facilitate, or support
medical evaluations and acute and long-term care for individuals
affected by AHIs or and other counterintelligence-related health in-
cidents. The Committee further directs the CIA to brief the con-
gressional intelligence committees on the progress of the CIA in ad-
dressing these recommendations not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.

COMPLIANCE WITH RULE XLIV
Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate requires publica-
tion of a list of any ‘‘congressionally directed spending item, limited
tax benefit, and limited tariff benefit’’ that is included in the bill
or the committee report accompanying the bill. Consistent with the
determination of the Committee not to create any congressionally
directed spending items or earmarks, none have been included in
the bill, the report to accompany it, or the classified schedule of au-
thorizations. The bill, report, and classified schedule of authoriza-
tions also contain no limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits.
ESTIMATE OF COSTS
Pursuant to paragraph 11(a)(3) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee deems it impractical to include
an estimate of the costs incurred in carrying out the provisions of
this report due to the classified nature of the operations conducted
pursuant to this legislation. On July 16, 2025, the Committee
transmitted this bill to the Congressional Budget Office and re-
quested an estimate of the costs incurred in carrying out the un-
classified provisions.
EVALUATION OF REGULATORY IMPACT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee finds that no substantial regu-
latory impact will be incurred by implementing the provisions of
this legislation.
CHANGES TO EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee finds that it is necessary to dis-
pense with the requirement of paragraph 12 to expedite the busi-
ness of the Senate.

MINORITY VIEWS OF SENATOR WYDEN
The Fiscal Year 2026 Intelligence Authorization Act represents a
significant step backward for congressional oversight of the Intel-
ligence Community. First, the bill eliminates the long-standing re-
quirement that the general counsels of the CIA and the Office of
the Director of National Intelligence be confirmed by the Senate.
This change would leave a conspicuous hole in congressional over-
sight of national security, given that the general counsels of the
Department of Defense, the Army, Navy and Air Force, and the De-
partments of Homeland Security and Energy, as well as the Legal
Advisor of the State Department, are all Senate confirmed. It is
particularly troubling as Intelligence Community general counsels
operate secretly, making decisions and offering legal advice on top-
ics such as surveillance and torture, with no public accountability
other than the vetting and scrutiny that comes from the confirma-
tion process.
Second, the bill lacks a provision, which was included in last
year’s Committee-passed bill, that would require the Intelligence
Community to explain to the Committee when the heads of Intel-
ligence Community entities exercise their authority to fire per-
sonnel without any process or protections. Given the rash of dubi-
ous and unexplained firings in recent months, this lack of oversight
hamstrings the Committee’s ability to scrutinize and mitigate ef-
forts to politicize the Intelligence Community workforce.
I have a number of concerns related to the bill’s provisions re-
lated to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and urge
the Committee to conduct an in-depth review of what reforms will
advance, rather than undermine the purposes for which the Office
was created after 9/11. For example, the bill renames the National
Counterterrorism Center the ‘‘National Counterterrorism and
Counternarcotics Center,’’ suggesting that two very different
threats to the country should be addressed under the same govern-
ment framework, relying on the same resources and personnel, and
operating under the same set of intelligence authorities. Such an
approach risks undermining the country’s efforts to combat both.
The bill extends for ten years the Cybersecurity Information
Sharing Act of 2015, whose passage I opposed due to a lack of pro-
tections for Americans’ personal information. In September 2024,
the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General issued a
report (OIG–24–60) that found that the government was not shar-
ing cyber threat information with companies, and that companies
were not sharing cyber threat information with each other or the
government. These findings highlight how the program has failed
and is not worthy of reauthorization.
I also have serious concerns about classified matters that are ei-
ther in the classified annex or that the annex fails to address. At
the same time, I am deeply troubled by increasing impediments to

Committee oversight. Abuses of both the ‘‘Gang of 8’’ briefings,
whereby the Intelligence Community withholds information from
the full Committee, and restrictions on staff access to intelligence
programs are the worst they have been in 20 years.
Several other topics related to the bill are worthy of discussion.
First, the bill prohibits the Department of Homeland Security’s Of-
fice of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) from ‘‘engaging in the collec-
tion of information or intelligence targeting any United States per-
son.’’ Given I&A’s abuses in Portland, Oregon, in 2020, I welcome
efforts to rein in its authorities, particularly if they have the effect
of prohibiting the compilation of dossiers of Americans’ First
Amendment-protected speech and precluding I&A from secretly in-
filtrating private communications, which the current nominee to be
Under Secretary for I&A has incorrectly asserted is permissible. I
am concerned, however, that this provision falls short. The excep-
tion permitting I&A to collect from the ‘‘private sector’’ might be
read to allow I&A to obtain information on Americans through
their landlords, their bosses, their neighborhood grocery stores or
data brokers. The provision also fails to address collection on Amer-
icans by other intelligence components within the Department of
Homeland Security, despite the Under Secretary’s statutory man-
date to issue policies and guidelines for those components.
Second, the bill is being reported at a time of serious threat to
the independence of the inspectors general. The Director of Na-
tional Intelligence recently fired the IC IG’s acting counsel under
a mistaken reading of the law that grants IGs final approval for
personnel decisions (50 U.S.C. §3033(j)(3)). That statutory lan-
guage originated with the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2010, the report to which clearly stated it was intended to
bring the authorities of the IC IG into conformity with the aug-
mented authorities created by the Inspector General Reform Act of
2008. That law established that ‘‘each Office of Inspector General
shall be considered to be a separate agency’’ and ‘‘the Inspector
General who is the head of an office . . . shall, with respect to such
office, have the functions, powers, and duties of an agency head or
appointing authority under such provisions.’’ The IG’s statutory
personnel authorities concerning personnel permanently assigned
to the Office of Inspector General is thus clearly intended to cover
all OIG personnel not detailed from another agency, rather than
creating an arbitrary and unworkable carve out of the IG’s authori-
ties over its own personnel, as the DNI would have it. It is in the
context of this dispute that I offered an amendment requiring that,
if the head of an IC element transfers money from an IG over the
IG’s objections, the IC has to explain to the Committee why it is
in the vital national security interests of the United States to do
so. The Committee’s defeat of this amendment represents another
set-back for oversight.
Despite these concerns, I am pleased that the bill includes many
provisions I put forward. These include protections for whistle-
blowers, allowing them to come to Congress without having to go
through their agencies, ensuring that their efforts to communicate
with Congress through the IC’s offices of congressional and legisla-
tive affairs are protected from reprisal, ensuring that their security
clearances can’t be revoked on a pretext, removing the cap on dam-

ages for retaliatory revocation of whistleblower clearances, and pro-
hibiting, as acts of reprisal, disclosures of whistleblowers’ identities
as well as orders to undertake psychological examinations. The bill
also includes a provision from last year’s bill requiring congres-
sional and public reporting on the Intelligence Community’s pur-
chase and use of sensitive data on Americans.
The bill further includes my provision prohibiting the Intel-
ligence Community from contracting with companies that collect
and sell geolocation data associated with intelligence facilities, as
well as my amendment requiring annual reporting on FBI national
security investigations.
Finally, the bill includes my provision requiring the FBI to de-
classify any information related to whether foreign government of-
ficials have helped their nationals flee the United States while
under investigation or awaiting trial or sentencing for a crime com-
mitted in the United States. In 2016, a Saudi national was accused
in the hit-and-run death of Fallon Smart, a 15-year-old Portland
girl. The flight from the United States of that Saudi national before
trial prompted me to push through legislation requiring the declas-
sification of a 2019 FBI report describing a pattern of Saudi offi-
cials helping Saudi nationals flee the country to avoid the U.S. jus-
tice system. The subsequent adoption by the State Department of
a policy to identify and revoke the visas of foreign officials respon-
sible for these practices was an important step forward, but imple-
mentation of the policy, as well as warnings to local U.S. officials,
depends on the declassification of any additional information
known to the United States government.
