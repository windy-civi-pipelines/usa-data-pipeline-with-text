PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 2201, the ‘‘Improving VA Training for Military Sexual Trau-
ma Claims Act,’’ was introduced by Rep. Young Kim of California
on March 18, 2025. The bill, as amended, would ensure Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees who process claims for
disability compensation based on military sexual trauma (MST),
and the VA claims processors who communicate with claimants
about such MST claims, undergo annual sensitivity training and
annual training on how to identify the evidence needed to support
MST claims. The bill, as amended, would also require VA to auto-
matically obtain all service personnel and service medical records
of a veteran who filed an MST claim. Finally, the bill would require
VA to submit a plan to Congress on how VA will improve sensi-
tivity training required for contracted vendors who schedule and

perform disability compensation examinations for veterans who file
MST claims.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving VA Training for Mili-
tary Sexual Trauma Claims Act.’’
Section 2: Improvement of Claims Based on Military Sexual Trau-
ma Under Laws Administered by the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs
When a veteran files a disability benefits claim, under 38 U.S.C.
§ 5103A, VA has a ‘‘duty to assist’’ the veteran with obtaining fed-
eral records, including service treatment records and service per-
sonnel records, relevant to their claim. Claims for service connec-
tion for a disability, such as post-traumatic stress, based on an in-
service military sexual trauma (MST) are often difficult to prove
because a veteran’s service records rarely directly corroborate that
MST occurred, due primarily to military culture that discourages
reporting MST. Current law (e.g., 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5)), there-
fore, allows VA to consider evidence in a veteran’s service medical
and service personnel records that could corroborate the veteran’s
account of experiencing an MST—so-called ‘‘markers’’.
Service personnel records can include markers of MST, such as
a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment, or de-
terioration in military duty performance. A claims processor may
place a request with the appropriate service records storage facility
to provide a complete copy of both a veteran’s service medical
records and service personnel records (e.g., a single
PersonnelInformation Exchange System (PIES) request for both
types of records).1 Yet, VA claims processors do not always obtain
the service personnel records, and the VA Board of Veterans’ Ap-
peals (Board) continues to find that the Veterans Benefits Adminis-
tration (VBA) claims processors failed under VA’s duty to assist to
obtain a veteran’s service medical records and service personnel
records in MST claims.2
VA is required by law to provide claims processors with training
to identify those ‘‘markers,’’ but there is no requirement under the
law for annual training to refresh their knowledge of complex MST
claims. Also, inadequate sensitivity training has resulted in insen-
sitive VA communications to MST victims that can retraumatize
those veterans. Although VA is reportedly amending the language
used in VA claims decisions to ensure they are more sensitive,
those claims decisions are just one of many different types of com-
munications that VBA claims processors have with MST survivors.3
VA requires a one-time sensitivity training for claims processors

who communicate with veterans who experienced an MST,4 but
there is no requirement under the law to provide those claims proc-
essors with annual sensitivity training refreshers and to keep up
with new best practices in trauma-informed communication.
In fiscal year 2024, 10.6 percent of all denied MST claims were
denied because the veteran did not appear for their scheduled dis-
ability compensation examination. Roughly 95% of these exams are
conducted by contracted exam vendors. The Committee has learned
from veterans’ advocates and exam vendors that MST survivors
often miss their exams because retelling their MST experience is
triggering for them, and the exam schedulers and the examiners
are often insensitive or not trauma-informed. Although VA recently
provided contracted examination vendors with a ‘‘guide’’ for trau-
ma-informed communication with veterans,5 contracted schedulers
and examiners are not required by VA to regularly complete com-
prehensive sensitivity training. The Committee has learned from
vendors about how there are inconsistent policies from vendor to
vendor concerning how they interact with MST survivors.
At a March 26, 2025, Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and
Memorial Affairs legislative hearing,6 the Committee heard from
veterans’ advocates that improvements should be made to ensure
that MST survivors receive accurate and timely decisions on their
claims, and that communications from VA claims processors and
contracted examination vendors to MST survivors are trauma-in-
formed to prevent re-traumatization.
In a statement for the record for the March 26, 2025, legislative
hearing, Ms. Nancy Springer, Associate Director, National Legisla-
tive Service, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, stated:
‘‘Some MST survivors are hesitant to report their incidents
for a variety of reasons, one of which is a fear of retrauma-
tization during the claims process. A claims processor asking
probing questions or a claimant having to repeatedly recount
assault details could be a trigger. To help prevent these situa-
tions, the VFW fully supports mandating this sensitivity train-
ing to teach claims processors how to elicit vital information
for claims adjudication without retraumatizing . . .’’
‘‘Though their records may not contain traditional evi-
dentiary support such as a medical examination directly attrib-
utable to a trauma, an investigation report, or a police report,
they may include ‘‘markers’’ that could substantiate a claim or
provide cause for further medical examination or opinion. For
example, personnel records could include abrupt or non-
standard transfer requests or performance evaluations that in-
dicate an inexplicable drop in performance. VA automatically
obtaining these records for claims related to MST and mental
health would standardize and therefore streamline procedures
for these typically complicated and nuanced claims.’’7

In a statement for the record for the March 26, 2025, legislative
hearing, Mr. Marquis D. Barefield, Assistant National Legislative
Director, Disabled American Veterans, stated:
‘‘Markers of MST are often difficult to verify in medical
records. This bill highlights the need, especially for claims re-
lated to MST to require VA to obtain personnel records and
service treatment records and review them for these markers
if there is no other supporting evidence of record. This change
will increase the veteran’s ability to validate their claim and
obtain the benefits they earned. By requiring those who proc-
ess MST claims to attend annual sensitivity training and train-
ing tailored to MST, they are better equipped to handle these
unique cases with care and professionalism and not retrauma-
tizing veterans in the process.’’8
In her written testimony for the March 26, 2025, legislative hear-
ing, Ms. Diane Boyd Rauber, Executive Director, National Organi-
zation of Veterans’ Advocates, Inc., stated that ‘‘VA should always
be obtaining the service personnel record and service medical
record of every veteran seeking benefits as part of its regular duty
to assist.’’9
To address these issues, this section would require VA employees
who process MST based claims and those who communicate with
claimants about such claims undergo annual training, commensu-
rate with their experience level, on how to identify ‘‘markers’’ in
evidence that could support a grant of an MST claim. This section
would also require annual sensitivity training for VA claims proc-
essors and require VA to update such training annually. It would
also require VA to report to Congress on the training required by
this section. Additionally, this section would require VA to auto-
matically obtain all service personnel and service medical records
of a veteran who filed an MST claim. Finally, this section would
require VA to submit a plan to Congress on how VA will improve
sensitivity training required for contracted disability compensation
examiners, as well as for those who schedule contracted examina-
tions.
The Committee believes that this section is critical to ensure that
veterans who have endured a military sexual trauma are not re-
traumatized by the VA disability compensation process, including
when receiving VA communications and undergoing VA-contracted
disability compensation examinations. The Committee also believes
that this section is important to ensure that veterans pursuing dis-
ability compensation based on a military sexual trauma receive
timely and accurate decisions on their claims.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause (2)(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Commit-
tee’s oversight findings and recommendations are reflected in the
descriptive portions of this report.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In accordance with clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee’s performance goals and
objectives of H.R. 2201, as amended, are to ensure that veterans
who have endured a military sexual trauma are not retraumatized
by the VA disability compensation process and ensure veterans
have access to their earned VA disability compensation benefits.
EARMARKS AND TAX AND TARIFF BENEFITS
H.R. 2201, as amended, does not contain any Congressional ear-
marks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in
clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
The Committee adopts as its own the Congressional Budget Of-
fice cost estimate on this measure.
BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the following is the cost estimate for H.R. 1969,
as amended, provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:
H.R. 2201 would require the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) to provide annual sensitivity training for employees who proc-
ess or decide claims for VA benefits that result from military sex-
ual trauma (MST). The bill also would require VA to obtain a vet-

eran’s service personnel and service medical records when proc-
essing those claims. The department already provides annual sensi-
tivity training to employees who handle MST-related claims. Fur-
ther, VA is already required to assist veterans in obtaining nec-
essary evidence to substantiate benefits claims under current law.
Such evidence may include the veteran’s service personnel and
service medical records, as well as other evidence. Because VA is
already providing employees with annual sensitivity training and
is required to obtain all necessary evidence when processing bene-
fits claims, those requirements would not affect the federal budget.
The bill would also require VA to submit two reports to the Con-
gress on the sensitivity training it provides to department employ-
ees and to contracted medical professionals who process, decide, or
evaluate claims for VA benefits concerning MST. Using information
on the cost of similar reports, CBO estimates the reporting require-
ments would increase spending subject to appropriation by less
than $500,000.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Logan Smith. The esti-
mate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Con-
trol Act (as amended by Section 101(a)(2) of the Unfunded Mandate
Reform Act, P.L. 104–4 is inapplicable to H.R. 2201, as amended.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act would be created by H.R. 2201, as
amended.
APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that H.R. 2201, as amended, does not relate
to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public serv-
ices or accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of
the Congressional Accountability Act.
STATEMENT ON DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
2201, as amended, would establish or reauthorize a program of the
Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

Section 1 would establish the short title of the bill as the ‘‘Im-
proving VA Training for Military Sexual Trauma Claims Act.’’

Section 2: Improvement of claims based on Military Sexual Trauma
under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs
Section 2 would amend 38 U.S.C. §1166(c), to require VA em-
ployees who process claims based on MST and who communicate
with claimants about such MST claims to undergo annual training,
appropriate for their experience level, on how to identify ‘‘markers’’
of MST, as well as annual sensitivity training. This section would
require VA to update such training annually, and, not later than
90 days after the enactment of the Act, to report to the Committees
on Veterans’ Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate on VA’s implementation of the training required by this section.
Second 2 would also amend 38 U.S.C. §5103A(c) to specify that
in an MST claim under 38 U.S.C. §1166, VA’s duty to assist shall
include obtaining the claimant’s service personnel records and serv-
ice medical records.
Finally, Section 2 would require VA, not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act, to submit to Committees on Vet-
erans’ Affairs of the Senate and House a report on (1) how VA will
improve sensitivity training required for contracted disability com-
pensation examiners, as well as for those who schedule contracted
examinations; and (2) VA’s plan to ensure that a veteran pursuing
an MST claim is not retraumatized during contracted disability
compensation examinations.

§5103A. Duty to assist claimants
(a) DUTY TO ASSIST.—(1) The Secretary shall make reasonable ef-
forts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to sub-
stantiate the claimant’s claim for a benefit under a law adminis-
tered by the Secretary.
(2) The Secretary is not required to provide assistance to a claim-
ant under this section if no reasonable possibility exists that such
assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.
(3) The Secretary may defer providing assistance under this sec-
tion pending the submission by the claimant of essential informa-
tion missing from the claimant’s application.
(b) ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING PRIVATE RECORDS.—(1) As part of
the assistance provided under subsection (a), the Secretary shall
make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant private records that the
claimant adequately identifies to the Secretary.
(2)(A) Whenever the Secretary, after making such reasonable ef-
forts, is unable to obtain all of the relevant records sought, the Sec-
retary shall notify the claimant that the Secretary is unable to ob-
tain records with respect to the claim. Such a notification shall—
(i) identify the records the Secretary is unable to obtain;
(ii) briefly explain the efforts that the Secretary made to ob-
tain such records; and
(iii) explain that the Secretary will decide the claim based on
the evidence of record but that this section does not prohibit
the submission of records at a later date if such submission is
otherwise allowed.
(B) The Secretary shall make not less than two requests to a cus-
todian of a private record in order for an effort to obtain relevant
private records to be treated as reasonable under this section, un-
less it is made evident by the first request that a second request
would be futile in obtaining such records.
(3)(A) This section shall not apply if the evidence of record allows
for the Secretary to award the maximum benefit in accordance with
this title based on the evidence of record.
(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘maximum benefit’’
means the highest evaluation assignable in accordance with the
evidence of record, as long as such evidence is adequate for rating
purposes and sufficient to grant the earliest possible effective date
in accordance with section 5110 of this title.
(4) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the Sec-
retary—
(A) shall encourage claimants to submit relevant private
medical records of the claimant to the Secretary if such sub-
mission does not burden the claimant; and
(B) in obtaining relevant private records under paragraph
(1), may require the claimant to authorize the Secretary to ob-
tain such records if such authorization is required to comply
with Federal, State, or local law.

(c) OBTAINING RECORDS FOR COMPENSATION CLAIMS.—(1) In the
case of a claim for disability compensation, the assistance provided
by the Secretary under this section shall include obtaining the fol-
lowing records if relevant to the claim:
(A) The claimant’s service medical records and, if the claim-
ant has furnished the Secretary information sufficient to locate
such records, other relevant records pertaining to the claim-
ant’s active military, naval, air, or space service that are held
or maintained by a governmental entity.
(B) Records of relevant medical treatment or examination of
the claimant at Department health-care facilities or at the ex-
pense of the Department, if the claimant furnishes information
sufficient to locate those records.
(C) Any other relevant records held by any Federal depart-
ment or agency that the claimant adequately identifies and au-
thorizes the Secretary to obtain.
(2) In the case of a claim under section 1166 of this title, the as-
sistance provided by the Secretary under this section shall include
obtaining—
(A) the service personnel record of the claimant; and
(B) the service medical record of the claimant.
ø(2)¿ (3) Whenever the Secretary attempts to obtain records from
a Federal department or agency under this subsection, the efforts
to obtain those records shall continue until the records are obtained
unless it is reasonably certain that such records do not exist or
that further efforts to obtain those records would be futile.
(d) MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS FOR COMPENSATION CLAIMS.—(1) In
the case of a claim for disability compensation, the assistance pro-
vided by the Secretary under subsection (a) shall include providing
a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such
an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the
claim.
(2) The Secretary shall treat an examination or opinion as being
necessary to make a decision on a claim for purposes of paragraph
(1) if the evidence of record before the Secretary, taking into con-
sideration all information and lay or medical evidence (including
statements of the claimant)—
(A) contains competent evidence that the claimant has a cur-
rent disability, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of dis-
ability; and
(B) indicates that the disability or symptoms may be associ-
ated with the claimant’s active military, naval, air, or space
service; but
(C) does not contain sufficient medical evidence for the Sec-
retary to make a decision on the claim.
(e) APPLICABILITY OF DUTY TO ASSIST.—(1) The Secretary’s duty
to assist under this section shall apply only to a claim, or supple-
mental claim, for a benefit under a law administered by the Sec-
retary until the time that a claimant is provided notice of the agen-
cy of original jurisdiction’s decision with respect to such claim, or
supplemental claim, under section 5104 of this title.
(2) The Secretary’s duty to assist under this section shall not
apply to higher-level review by the agency of original jurisdiction,
pursuant to section 5104B of this title, or to review on appeal by
the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.

(f) CORRECTION OF DUTY TO ASSIST ERRORS.—(1) If, during re-
view of the agency of original jurisdiction decision under section
5104B of this title, the higher-level adjudicator identifies or learns
of an error on the part of the agency of original jurisdiction to sat-
isfy its duties under this section, and that error occurred prior to
the agency of original jurisdiction decision being reviewed, unless
the Secretary may award the maximum benefit in accordance with
this title based on the evidence of record, the higher-level adjudi-
cator shall return the claim for correction of such error and readju-
dication.
(2)(A) If the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, during review on appeal
of an agency of original jurisdiction decision, identifies or learns of
an error on the part of the agency of original jurisdiction to satisfy
its duties under this section, and that error occurred prior to the
agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal, unless the Sec-
retary may award the maximum benefit in accordance with this
title based on the evidence of record, the Board shall remand the
claim to the agency of original jurisdiction for correction of such
error and readjudication.
(B) Remand for correction of such error may include directing the
agency of original jurisdiction to obtain an advisory medical opinion
under section 5109 of this title.
(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to imply that
the Secretary, during the consideration of a claim, does not have
a duty to correct an error described in paragraph (1) or (2) that was
erroneously not identified during higher-level review or during re-
view on appeal with respect to the claim.
(g) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to
carry out this section.
(h) RULE WITH RESPECT TO DISALLOWED CLAIMS.—Nothing in
this section shall be construed to require the Secretary to readjudi-
cate a claim that has been disallowed except when new and rel-
evant evidence is presented or secured, as described in section 5108
of this title.
(i) OTHER ASSISTANCE NOT PRECLUDED.—Nothing in this section
shall be construed as precluding the Secretary from providing such
other assistance under subsection (a) to a claimant in substan-
tiating a claim as the Secretary considers appropriate.
