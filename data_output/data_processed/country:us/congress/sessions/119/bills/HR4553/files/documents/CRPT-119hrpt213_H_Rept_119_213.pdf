INTRODUCTION
The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Ap-
propriations bill for fiscal year 2026 totals $57,300,000,000.
The funding levels provided in this bill demonstrate this Com-
mittee’s dedication to fiscal responsibility, while continuing to fund
the highest priority programs and activities. This bill prioritizes in-
vestments that safeguard U.S. national security, unleash American
energy dominance, and further economic competitiveness.
Title I of the bill provides $9,883,000,000 for the civil works pro-
grams of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The bill makes use of
the adjustments provided in Public Law 116–136 and Public Law
116–260 regarding the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and sec-
tion 2106(c) of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act
of 2014. Total funding for these activities is estimated at
$3,535,000,000.
Title II provides $1,895,000,000 for the Department of the Inte-
rior and the Bureau of Reclamation. The Committee recommends
$1,710,630,000 for the Bureau of Reclamation and $23,000,000 for
the Central Utah Project.
Title III provides $48,753,873,000 for the Department of Energy.
Funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA),
which includes Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonprolifera-
tion, Naval Reactors, and Federal Salaries and Expenses, is
$25,316,654,000. Funding for Energy Programs within the Depart-
ment of Energy, which includes basic science research and the ap-
plied energy programs, is $15,659,873,000. Environmental Manage-
ment activities—Non-defense Environmental Cleanup, Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning, and Defense
Environmental Cleanup—are funded at $7,703,476,000.
Title IV provides $460,425,000 for several Independent Agencies,
including $148,190,000 in net funding for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAMS
The Committee considers the national defense programs of the
National Nuclear Security Administration to be the Department of
Energy’s top priority. As the global nuclear threat landscape con-
tinues to evolve, so, too, must the U.S. nuclear deterrent. The Na-
tion’s defense against all adversaries, including China and Russia,
rests on a strong nuclear deterrent. Therefore, the recommendation
strongly supports efforts to modernize the nuclear weapons stock-
pile, increase investment in NNSA’s infrastructure, prevent the
proliferation of nuclear materials, and provide for the needs of the
naval nuclear propulsion program.
Within funding for NNSA’s Weapons Activities, the recommenda-
tion continues robust support for the multi-year modernization

plans for the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile and its supporting
infrastructure. The Committee recommendation also provides addi-
tional investments above the budget request, such as funding for
the Uranium Processing Facility, Lithium Processing Facility, and
the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile–Nuclear (SLCM–N) Warhead pro-
gram, to ensure these critical activities move forward on-time and
on-budget. Program and project management efforts must be im-
proved to prevent further schedule delays and cost increases, par-
ticularly on major construction projects.
The Committee also strongly supports the activities to maintain
the Nation’s nuclear naval fleet, which is funded through the Naval
Reactors account. The Naval Reactors funding supports the current
operational nuclear fleet, continues development of the Columbia-
class ballistic missile submarine reactor, continues construction of
the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project, and ensures re-
search and development efforts for the next generation of nuclear-
powered warships continue to progress.
AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE
The Department of Energy and its national laboratory system
have been instrumental in advancing scientific and technological
developments contributing to ensuring a safe, reliable, and afford-
able energy system for the Nation. The recommendation targets in-
vestments to the activities most important to advancing the Admin-
istration’s agenda of unleashing American energy dominance.
The Committee has long supported nuclear power as a baseload,
carbon-free source of electricity and a significant contributor to the
Nation’s energy mix. A revitalized American nuclear industry also
provides an additional energy export of geopolitical consequence,
especially for countries seeking alternatives to Russian and Chi-
nese entanglements. The recommendation strongly supports the ac-
celerated development and deployment of advanced reactors, in-
cluding small modular reactors, as well as the availability of do-
mestic uranium enrichment capabilities.
The recommendation makes strategic investments in critical
minerals to reduce the Nation’s reliance on foreign sources and
bring production capabilities back to America. This approach
makes full use of the Nation’s vast domestic resources and en-
hances U.S. technological capabilities while securing the full supply
chain of critical minerals.
The recommendation continues strong support for basic science
research programs, which provide the foundation for new energy
technologies. The recommendation increases support for continued
operations of experimental user facilities, construction of large-
scale and innovative scientific experiments, quantum information
sciences, and advanced computing research. The recommendation
also makes strategic investments in fusion energy sciences to help
usher in a new wave of energy technologies that can lead to fusion
energy breakthroughs and an eventual commercial fusion power
plant. The Committee also recognizes the importance of securing
the energy sector against cyber threats. In addition to maintaining
funding for the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emer-
gency Response, the recommendation supports prioritization of cy-
bersecurity issues across most programs of the Department.

ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS
The water resource infrastructure funded by the recommendation
is a critical component of ensuring a robust national economy and
supporting American competitiveness in international markets. The
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has been instrumental in re-
ducing the risk of flooding for public safety, businesses, and much
of this country’s food-producing lands. The Corps’ maintenance of
commercial waterways is directly tied to the ability of the Nation
to ship manufactured and bulk products, as well as to compete
with the ports of neighboring countries for the business of ships ar-
riving from around the world. The Bureau of Reclamation (Rec-
lamation) supplies reliable water to approximately 10 percent of
the country’s population and to much of its fertile agricultural
lands. Both agencies make significant contributions to national
electricity production through hydropower facilities.
The recommendation sustains critical funding for major infra-
structure projects and other activities by the Corps that promote
economic competitiveness and public safety; it prioritizes funding
within the Bureau of Reclamation toward projects that increase
water supply. The bill ensures that the Corps and Reclamation
have the resources to continue to support America’s economy.
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTION

TITLE I—CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY
CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL
INTRODUCTION
The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Ap-
propriations Act funds the civil works missions of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (Corps). This program is responsible for activi-
ties in support of coastal and inland navigation, flood and coastal
storm damage reduction, environmental protection and restoration,
hydropower, recreation, water supply, and disaster preparedness
and response. The Corps also performs regulatory oversight of nav-
igable waters.
AGING WATERWAY INFRASTRUCTURE
The Committee recognizes the extraordinary implications to the
local, regional, and national economy, as well as national security,
due to aging waterway infrastructure. The Committee urges the
Corps to continue to prioritize ongoing deep draft lock moderniza-
tion or replacement projects.
APPORTIONMENT UNDER A CONTINUING RESOLUTION
For the purposes of continuing resolutions starting in fiscal year
2018, the Office of Management and Budget changed the long-
standing policy by which funding is apportioned to the civil works
program of the Corps. Under the new policy, funding within an in-
dividual account was apportioned separately for amounts from the
general fund of the Treasury and amounts from various trust
funds.
The Committee has long intended the Corps to have the flexi-
bility to address the projects most in need of funding under a con-
tinuing resolution. The creation of artificial accounting distinctions
has the potential to cause serious impediments to the efficient and
effective implementation of the civil works program. For example,
work on many navigation projects is limited by environmental or
other regulatory windows. Further limitations imposed by sepa-
rately apportioning Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund monies could
cause serious disruptions to the economic activity that depends on
these navigation channels.
For these reasons, the Committee rejects the change in appor-
tionment policy and directs OMB to follow the previous policy dur-
ing any continuing resolutions that may occur in this or any future
fiscal years.
BUDGET STRUCTURE CHANGES
The fiscal year 2026 budget request for the Corps proposed nu-
merous structural changes, including the creation of a new Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund account and Inland Waterways Trust
Fund account; the shifting of various studies and projects among
accounts and business lines; and the consolidation of certain re-
maining items. The Committee rejects all such proposed changes
and instead funds all activities in the accounts in which funding
has traditionally been provided. Unless expressly noted, all projects

and studies remain at the levels proposed in the budget request
but may be funded in different accounts. In particular:
• Projects proposed for funding in the Harbor Maintenance
Trust Fund account in the budget request are funded in the
Construction, Mississippi River and Tributaries, and Operation
and Maintenance accounts, as appropriate;
• Dredged Material Management Plans, requested in the In-
vestigations account, are funded in the Operation and Mainte-
nance account;
• Disposition studies will continue to be funded under the
remaining item Disposition of Completed Projects in the Inves-
tigations account;
• Inspection of Completed Works, Project Condition Surveys,
Scheduling of Reservoir Operations, and Surveillance of North-
ern Boundary Waters will continue to be funded under states
instead of consolidated into national programs as requested in
the Operation and Maintenance account; and
• Dam Safety Modification Studies, requested in the Inves-
tigations and Mississippi River and Tributaries accounts, will
be funded under the Dam Safety and Seepage/Stability Correc-
tion Program remaining item in the Construction account.
For any future fiscal year, if the Corps proposes budget structure
changes, the budget proposal shall be accompanied by a display of
the funding request in the traditional budget structure.
DEEP-DRAFT NAVIGATION
The Committee remains mindful of the evolving infrastructure
needs of the Nation’s ports. Meeting these needs will be essential
if the Nation is to remain competitive in international markets and
to continue advancing economic development and job creation do-
mestically.
Investigation and construction of port projects, including the
deepening of existing projects, are cost-shared between the federal
government and non-federal sponsors, often local or regional port
authorities. The operation and maintenance of these projects are
federal responsibilities and are funded as reimbursements from the
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), which is supported by
an ad valorem tax on imported and domestic cargo. Expenditures
from the trust fund are subject to annual appropriations. The bal-
ance in the HMTF at the beginning of fiscal year 2026 is estimated
to be approximately $7,841,000,000.
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Execution.—The CARES Act
(Public Law 116–136) and the Water Resources Development Act
(WRDA) of 2020 (Public Law 116–260) made certain changes to the
methods by which funds from the HMTF are treated under discre-
tionary budget rules. The Committee provides an estimated
$3,473,000,000 in accordance with these changes. Additionally,
WRDA 2020 made certain changes to the methods by which funds
for section 2106(c) of the Water Resources Reform and Develop-
ment Act (WRRDA) of 2014 are treated under discretionary budget
rules. The Committee provides $62,000,000 for these purposes.
This funding should enable the Corps to make significant
progress on the backlog of dredging needs, and to an extent it has.
However, the Committee is aware of entire regions of the country
where two-way traffic is the exception not the rule, many projects

dredged on an annual basis but never to authorized dimensions,
and projects that have not been maintained in decades. When chal-
lenged on the causes, the Corps often cites availability of funding;
all the while, significant unobligated balances from prior-year ap-
propriations accrue. With this Committee meeting or even exceed-
ing the stated annual needs for HMTF-eligible work, the lack of
progress defies reason. The Corps is failing to adjust its navigation
maintenance program to the substantial budgetary resources the
Congress has made available and risks squandering them entirely.
The fiscal year 2024 Act included funding for the Corps to de-
velop a report intended to initiate the overdue process of identi-
fying, characterizing, and programming for the funding needed to
maintain all eligible projects to authorized dimensions. The Corps
shall provide to the Committee not later than 15 days after the
date of enactment of this Act a briefing on the status of this report
and the progress towards inventorying all authorized work. The
briefing shall include the specific steps necessary to complete this
process within six months of the date of the briefing such that the
Corps can develop work packages that support maintenance of all
eligible ports, harbors, and channels to authorized dimensions.
Dredge Recapitalization.—The recommendation includes
$50,000,000 to support dredge recapitalization. The Corps is en-
couraged to utilize these funds for replacement of the Dredge
Currituck in recognition of its relative age and unique capabilities
within the federal fleet. The Committee further notes the specific
capabilities of this vessel in contrast to those of available private
dredges.
Current law provides for an industry-first dredging policy and re-
quires the Corps to maintain the minimum federal fleet necessary,
a requirement the Corps seems to have interpreted to mean a cer-
tain number of vessels. The Committee fails to understand how
doubling or tripling the capacity of the federal fleet is consistent
with the statutory requirement. The Corps must closely collaborate
with the industrial base to address the gaps created by its manage-
ment of the federal fleet and contracting for industry dredging. The
Committee provided funding in the fiscal year 2024 Act to carry
out a report to identify the Nation’s dredging needs, and the Corps
is reminded that this report cannot successfully address the Na-
tion’s dredging needs if developed without appropriate collaboration
with industry.
Further, the Committee is perplexed by the Corps’ mismanage-
ment of the revolving fund since its creation; the Corps has failed
to maintain sufficient balances to recapitalize the federal dredge
fleet within available funds, requiring additional appropriations to
replace alternate dredges. This mismanagement has led to an aged
fleet with many vessels unable to perform work due to unantici-
pated maintenance requirements. The status quo is unacceptable,
and the Corps is reminded that prior failures to maintain the fed-
eral fleet within available funds drove the creation of the industry-
first policy.
The Corps is directed to provide to the Committee not later than
90 days after the date of enactment of this Act a copy of its dredge
replacement schedule and projected costs of replacing each dredge.
The schedule shall include a specific recapitalization plan for each
dredge in the federal fleet. The Corps is further reminded of the

many risks such financial mismanagement poses to program execu-
tion.
INLAND WATERWAYS SYSTEM
The Nation’s inland waterways system—consisting of approxi-
mately 12,000 miles of commercially navigable channels and 237
lock chambers—is also essential to supporting the national econ-
omy. Freight transported on the inland waterways system includes
a significant portion of the nation’s grain exports, domestic petro-
leum and petroleum products, and coal used in electricity genera-
tion. Much of the physical infrastructure of the system is aging,
however, and in need of improvements. For example, commercial
navigation locks typically have a design life of 50 years, yet nearly
80 percent of these locks in the United States are more than 50
years old, with the average age being 65 years old.
In accordance with WRDA 2024, capital improvements to the in-
land waterways system are generally funded 75 percent from the
general fund of the Treasury and 25 percent from the Inland Wa-
terways Trust Fund (IWTF), while operation and maintenance
costs are funded 100 percent from the general fund of the Treas-
ury. The IWTF is supported by a tax on barge fuel.
The Committee is disappointed that, after including robust sup-
port in the fiscal year 2025 work plan, the Corps did not include
any funds for inland waterways construction projects in its budget
request for a third consecutive year. For fiscal year 2026, the Com-
mittee provides robust funding above the budget request from the
IWTF for inland waterways projects. The Committee recommends
funding above the budget request for additional operation and
maintenance activities on the inland waterways.
INVASIVE CARP
The Corps is undertaking multiple efforts to stop the spread of
invasive carp throughout the United States. Section 509 of WRDA
2020 authorized demonstration projects to prevent the spread of
invasive carp into the Tennessee River and Cumberland River wa-
tersheds. There is an urgent need to prevent their migration from
the Ohio River into these watersheds and the Great Lakes. The
Committee appreciates the Corps’ increased attention to the threat
of invasive carp in these systems and the progress made following
years of delays. The Corps shall coordinate project partnership
agreements concurrent with program development to ensure bar-
riers can be deployed as soon as practicable. The Corps is further
directed to finalize the program management plan and begin as-
sessing demonstration projects, including appropriate deterrent
systems at Kentucky Lock.
In addition, the Corps is undertaking multiple efforts to stop
invasive carp from reaching the Great Lakes, including projects at
the Brandon Road Lock and Dam and in the Chicago Sanitary and
Ship Canal. Because these efforts are critical to keeping invasive
carp out of the Chicago Area Waterways System, the Corps is
urged to continue to prioritize progress, as necessary, using the ad-
ditional funding provided in this Act for projects to deter the ex-
pansion of carp into areas without established populations. The
Committee directs the Corps to continue to collaborate at levels
commensurate with previous years with the U.S. Coast Guard, the

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the State of Illinois, and members
of the Invasive Carp Regional Coordinating Committee, including
identifying navigation protocols that would be beneficial or effective
in reducing the risk of vessels inadvertently carrying aquatic
invasive species, including invasive carp, through the Brandon
Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois. The Corps is further directed
to implement navigation protocols shown to be effective at reducing
the risk of entrainment without jeopardizing the safety of vessels
and crews. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committee not
later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and
quarterly throughout the year thereafter, a briefing on these ef-
forts. The briefing shall address any findings of the required eval-
uation of navigation protocols.
FORMAT OF FUNDING PRIORITIES
The recommendation includes Community Project Funding re-
quested by Members of Congress to meet urgent needs across the
United States. Community Project Funding has been included in
this recommendation in the Investigations, Construction, Mis-
sissippi River and Tributaries, and Operation and Maintenance ac-
counts in a manner that adheres to the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the increased transparency and accountability
standards put in place by the Committee.
As in previous years, the Committee lists in report tables the
studies, projects, and activities within each account proposed in the
budget request along with the Committee-recommended funding
level.
To advance its programmatic priorities, the Committee has in-
cluded additional funding in some accounts for certain categories of
projects. Project-specific allocations within these categories will be
determined by the Corps based on further direction provided in this
report.
PROJECT FORMULATION AND DELIVERY
The Corps is failing to deliver projects as formulated and within
the cost estimates provided in Chief’s Reports. The Corps’ Civil
Works program is a partnership, and this Committee views a
Chief’s Report as a commitment to project sponsors, the American
taxpayer, the Congress, and the Corps itself. The Committee appre-
ciates initiatives undertaken by the Corps to begin to restore fidel-
ity to project formulation and de-risk construction. More must be
done.
Robust engineering and design during feasibility and prior to ini-
tiating construction, innovation in contracting, and leveraging per-
sonnel and expertise must form the foundation of a sustainable and
efficient Civil Works Construction program. The Committee agrees
that each project has unique challenges and requirements, and that
a milestone-based approach to feasibility studies will serve the pro-
gram better than the one-size-fits-all requirements that created the
current conditions. The Committee believes that the underpinnings
of different cost estimate classifications provide an effective start-
ing point for improvements.
Class 3 cost estimates require an intermediate level of design for

properly characterized during feasibility—namely, geotechnical sur-
veys, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and site characterization,
to include utility mappings. The Committee believes this standard,
which gained recent emphasis within the organization but is by no
means new, will set projects on a path to success and stability. The
Corps is reminded that the maturity of the project design and level
of technical detail is the primary factor that determines the class
of the estimate; the cost estimate classification cannot come first.
The Corps is further reminded that a certified class 3 cost estimate
does not retain its classification forever. A proper emphasis on de-
sign maturity and scope definition prior to construction fails with-
out timely and regular updates to projects cost, and these project
cost updates must go beyond indexing and instead be undertaken
to ensure a class 3 cost estimate is achieved.
Relatedly, uncertainty in the cost estimating phase and manage-
ment during construction related to lands, easements, rights of
way, relocations and disposals pose tremendous cost and schedule
risks. The Committee acknowledges these risk factors as non-fed-
eral responsibilities and urges the Corps to evaluate opportunities
to promote certainty and efficiencies associated with these require-
ments.
The Committee notes that these efforts may not be a panacea to
the challenges facing the Civil Works Construction program but
they are necessary. The Committee directs the Corps to establish
quantitative metrics and goals against which success will be meas-
ured; enable periodic review of the adequacy of the Corps’ cost and
schedule risk analysis, to include analysis of the model’s own effi-
cacy; developing and deploying expertise; and ongoing efforts to
promote engineering and design. These measures are essential to
a continuous improvement process.
Further, the Committee understands the magnitude of the work
required to address project cost updates of authorized-but-
unconstructed projects and existing bandwidth constraints within
the Cost Engineering Center of Expertise (MCX). MCX shall con-
tinue to prioritize cost certifications for ongoing major construction
projects while working to address the backlog of authorized-but-
unconstructed project cost updates.
The relevant provisions included in this Act and the report ac-
companying this Act are intended to reinforce within the Corps
that a project cannot be found technically feasible, economically
justified, and environmentally acceptable without the scope defini-
tion, engineering, and design maturity necessary to understand the
true costs of delivering that project in a manner consistent with ap-
plicable laws and regulations.
Project Partnerships.—The Corps is reminded that partnerships
are foundational to the Civil Works program. Project sponsors must
be meaningfully consulted on changes to project delivery and policy
changes that create new or different expectations for sponsors. The
Committee is aware of successful models that other federal agen-
cies employ in furtherance of cooperative federalism. The Corps is
directed to provide to the Committee not later than 90 days after
the date of enactment of this Act a briefing on opportunities to im-
prove collaboration with project sponsors and work with other fed-
eral agencies to establish best practices in this regard. The briefing
shall address specifically the applicability to the Civil Works pro-

gram of the Environmental Protection Agency’s process established
in response to Executive Order 13132.
The Committee appreciates and supports the Corps’ historical en-
gagements with sponsors and the opportunities offered to provide
technical assistance and collaborate with the stakeholder commu-
nity. The Committee understands uncertainty surrounding staffing
levels and travel restrictions have impacted relationships and op-
portunities for meaningful dialogue between stakeholders and the
government. The Committee expects more, not less, collaboration
with sponsors and stakeholders. The Corps is directed to identify
impediments to maintaining these historical, in-person engage-
ments, opportunities to maximize virtual engagements when prac-
ticable and productive, and to pursue the steps necessary to restore
in-person engagements.
Relatedly, the Committee is aware of serious concerns regarding
the Corps’ ability to operate and maintain projects within projected
staffing levels. The personnel employed by the Corps are necessary
for delivering the Corps’ mission, which drives the American econ-
omy and ensures public safety. In many cases, these personnel and
related operations are supported not by the general taxpayer but
in whole or in part by non-federal partners. The Corps shall pro-
vide to the Committee not later than 30 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act a briefing on the status of relieving the staffing
limitations to the extent necessary to operate projects safely and
collaborate meaningfully with sponsors throughout the fiscal year.
ADDITIONAL FUNDING
The recommendation includes funding in addition to the budget
request to ensure continued improvements to water resources infra-
structure that benefit the national economy, public safety, and en-
vironmental health. This funding is for additional work that either
was not included in the budget request or was inadequately budg-
eted.
The executive branch retains discretion over project-specific allo-
cation decisions within the additional funds provided, subject to
only the direction here and under the heading ‘‘Additional Funding
for Ongoing Work’’ within each of the Investigations, Construction,
Mississippi River and Tributaries, and Operation and Maintenance
accounts. A study or project may not be excluded from consider-
ation for funding for being ‘‘inconsistent with Administration pol-
icy.’’ The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is reminded
that these funds are in addition to the budget request, and OMB
budget metrics shall not be a reason to disqualify a study or project
from being funded.
The Committee remains concerned that OMB has communicated,
either implicitly or explicitly, to non-federal sponsors that chances
of being included in a budget request or work plan increase with
the amount of funding a non-federal sponsor can bring to a project
in excess of the required cost-share. Therefore, OMB is reminded
that voluntary funding in excess of legally required cost shares for
studies and projects, though acceptable, shall not be used as a cri-
terion for inclusion in the budget request or for allocating the addi-
tional funding provided.
It is expected that all the additional funding provided by this Act
will be allocated to specific programs, projects, or activities. The

focus of the allocation process shall favor the obligation, rather
than expenditure, of funds. Additionally, the Administration shall
consider the extent to which the Corps is able to obligate funds
within the fiscal year as it allocates the additional funding.
The Corps shall evaluate all studies and projects only within ac-
counts and categories consistent with previous congressional fund-
ing.
A project or study shall be eligible for additional funding within
the Investigations, Construction, and Mississippi River and Tribu-
taries accounts if: (1) it has received funding, other than through
a reprogramming, in at least one of the previous three fiscal years;
(2) it was previously funded and could reach a significant mile-
stone, complete a discrete element of work, or produce significant
outputs in fiscal year 2026; or (3) as appropriate, it is selected as
one of the new starts allowed in accordance with this Act and the
additional direction provided below. None of the additional funding
in any account may be used for any item where funding was spe-
cifically denied, except that funds may be allocated to any other-
wise eligible new study start, or for projects in the Continuing Au-
thorities Program. Funds shall be allocated consistent with statu-
tory cost share requirements.
Work Plan.—Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment
of this Act, and not less than three business days prior to public
release, the Corps shall provide to the Committee a work plan in-
cluding the following information: (1) a detailed description of the
process and criteria used to evaluate studies and projects; (2) delin-
eation of how these funds are to be allocated; (3) a summary of the
work to be accomplished with each allocation, including phase of
work; and (4) a list of all studies and projects that were considered
eligible for funding but did not receive funding, including an expla-
nation of whether the study or project could have used funds in fis-
cal year 2026 and the specific reasons each study or project was
considered as being less competitive for an allocation of funds.
NEW STARTS
The Committee faces the competing challenges of ensuring the
Corps can finish the work it starts in as efficient a manner as pos-
sible while continuing to address the most urgent water resources
challenges across the Nation. In furtherance of these goals, in re-
cent years when Congress has made supplemental appropriations
available to promote resiliency to future natural disasters, the
Committee routinely directed the Corps to complete projects within
supplemental funds, and the executive branch routinely oversub-
scribed those funds. This dynamic, coupled with significant cost es-
calations facing the entire enterprise, has imposed a tremendous
burden on annual appropriations to continue delivering an effective
program that promotes America’s economic competitiveness and
public safety. While there remains significant need for investments
in new water resources projects, the Committee must prioritize ad-
vancing and completing ongoing work. The Committee recommends
two new starts in Investigations. No further new starts are rec-
ommended.
The Committee reiterates prior congressional direction regarding
the selection and designation of new starts. The Corps is directed
to notify the Committee at least seven days prior to execution of

an agreement for construction of any project except environmental
infrastructure projects and projects under the Continuing Authori-
ties Program.
Decisions regarding the processes by which projects may be made
eligible for funding or the manner in which projects are funded can
be made only by the Committees on Appropriations. As such, the
Committee reiterates previous congressional direction as follows.
Neither study nor construction activities related to individual
projects authorized under section 1037 of the WRRDA of 2014 shall
require a new start or new investment decision; these activities
shall be considered ongoing work. No new start or new investment
decision shall be required when moving from feasibility to
preconstruction engineering and design (PED). The initiation of
construction of an individually authorized project funded within a
programmatic line item may not require a new start designation
provided that some amount of construction funding under such pro-
grammatic line item was appropriated and expended during the
previous fiscal year. No new start or new investment decision shall
be required to initiate work on a separable element of a project
when construction of one or more separable elements of that project
was initiated previously; it shall be considered ongoing work. A
new construction start shall not be required for work undertaken
to correct a design deficiency on an existing federal project; it shall
be considered ongoing work.
During the budget formulation process, the Corps is strongly en-
couraged to give careful consideration to the out-year budget im-
pacts of any studies selected as new starts and to whether there
appears to be an identifiable non-federal sponsor that will be ready
and able to provide, in a timely manner, the necessary cost share
for the feasibility and PED phases.
During the budget formulation process, the Corps also shall con-
sider the out-year budget impacts of any selected new starts and
the non-federal sponsor’s ability and willingness to promptly pro-
vide required cash contributions, if any, as well as required lands,
easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and disposal areas. When
considering new study starts, the Corps should include only those
that can execute a feasibility cost sharing agreement during the
upcoming fiscal year.
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTION AND REPROGRAMMING
To ensure that the expenditure of funds in fiscal year 2026 is
consistent with congressional direction, to minimize the movement
of funds, and to improve overall budget execution, the Act incor-
porates by reference the projects and direction identified in the re-
port accompanying this Act into statute. Further, the Act carries
a legislative provision outlining the circumstances under which the
Corps may reprogram funds. Decisions regarding reprogramming
limits and processes can only be made by the Committees on Ap-
propriations.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee recommends $9,883,000,000 for the Corps.

Additional Funding.—The Corps shall allocate the additional
funding provided in this account primarily to specific feasibility
and preconstruction engineering and design (PED) phases, rather
than to Remaining Items line items as has been the case in pre-
vious work plans. When allocating the additional funding provided
in this account, the Corps shall consider giving priority to com-
pleting or accelerating ongoing studies that: will enhance the Na-
tion’s economic development, job growth, and international com-
petitiveness; are for projects located in areas that have suffered re-
cent natural disasters; are for projects that protect life and prop-
erty; or are for projects to address legal requirements. While the
additional funding is shown in the feasibility column, the Corps
shall use these funds for additional work in both the feasibility and
PED phases, except as specifically provided for in this report. The
Administration is reminded that a project study is not complete
until the PED phase is complete and that no new start or new in-
vestment decision shall be required when moving from feasibility
to PED.
The Committee recognizes the importance of the two Investiga-
tions new starts proposed in the budget request, Salem River,
Salem County, NJ, and Maurice River, NJ. While the overall de-
mand for new studies exceeded the number of new starts the Com-
mittee could recommend for fiscal year 2026, these two studies
shall be eligible to compete for the two total new starts rec-
ommended for Investigations.
The Committee supports the Corps’ policy outlined in Engineer-
ing Regulation (ER) 1110–2–1302 and further clarified in a June
2023 memorandum that requires feasibility studies to include class
3 estimates prior to the signing of a Chief of Engineer’s report. Of
the additional funding provided in this account, the Corps shall al-
locate not less than $10,000,000 to feasibility studies initiated in
fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 to progress those studies
in a manner consistent with this policy, and the Secretary shall
issue a waiver pursuant to section 1001(b) of Public Law 113–121
for each such study for such an amount and time as necessary to
achieve a class 3 cost estimate.
The June 2023 memorandum provided additional guidance re-
lated to ER 1110–2–1302 for updating project costs for authorized-
but-unconstructed projects. Of the additional funding provided in
this account, the Corps shall allocate $20,000,000 to studies in the
PED phase and for which construction has been authorized to
achieve a class 3 estimate for the entire scope of the project prior
to execution of a project partnership agreement. Studies shall be el-
igible to receive allocations from this amount that have active de-
sign agreements or after a non-federal sponsor has submitted a let-
ter of intent for the required engineering and design work.
Arkansas-Red River Basins Chloride Control–Area VIII, TX.—No
funds from this Act or a prior Act may be used to continue the dis-
position study for the Arkansas Red River Chloride Control Project.
The Corps is reminded that such restriction shall continue during
any period covered by a continuing resolution.
Authorized-But-Unconstructed Projects (ABUs).—The Committee
is aware of approximately 120 ABUs that require regular project
cost updates. However, as this work must be cost shared, the Corps
is expected to prioritize project cost updates for those projects with

an active and willing non-federal sponsor. The Committee is aware
of concerns that some inactive ABUs may be unknown to the com-
munities those projects would serve; these projects may have been
formulated well before more recent changes in population and com-
munity composition. The Corps is strongly encouraged to conduct
outreach to communities covered by inactive ABUs where the
Corps may reasonably expect a renewed interest based on popu-
lation shifts. The Corps is directed to review its inventory of ABUs
to identify active and inactive projects and further identify which
inactive ABUs have greater potential to regain active interest from
a non-federal sponsor. The Corps shall provide to the Committee
not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act a
copy of this review that delineates between active and inactive
ABUs in the manner described under this heading.
Black Butte Dam, Stony Creek, CA.—The Committee is sup-
portive of flood risk management and water supply benefits af-
forded by Black Butte Dam. The Committee understands that mul-
tiple study efforts are being pursued to address a variety of out-
standing needs, each of which may recommend major construction
work. The Committee supports efforts to find efficiencies during
construction and expects the Corps to consolidate construction ef-
forts when practicable and not otherwise restricted by law or exist-
ing policy. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committee not
later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act a briefing
on the benefits and risks of integrating and pursuing concurrently
the forthcoming Issue Evaluation Study and proposed spillway gate
study. The Corps is encouraged to include appropriate funding in
future budget submissions for these efforts and to work with the
project sponsor to align objectives and make expeditious progress.
Buchanan Dam–H.V. Eastman Lake, CA.—The Committee is
aware that local stakeholders are interested in studying modifica-
tions to the existing project to increase reservoir capacity. The
Corps is encouraged to include appropriate funding in future budg-
et submissions for this effort.
Collection and Study of Basic Data.—To improve transparency
for the public, the Committee has organized the various programs
under this overarching line item. The funding recommended for
this line item shall be for the base program funded in prior fiscal
years under the ‘‘Coastal Ocean Data System (CODS)’’ line item in
the Operation and Maintenance account. None of these funds may
be used for research and development activities previously funded
otherwise within that line item. Within available funds, no less
than $8,000,000 shall be for long-term coastal wave and coastal
sediment observations, research, and data products that support
sustainable coastal navigation projects.
Disposition of Completed Projects.—The Corps is directed to pro-
vide to the Committee copies of disposition studies upon comple-
tion.
Farmington Dam, CA.—The Committee understands the impor-
tance of additional above-ground water storage in drought-prone
regions and those experiencing groundwater overdraft, such as
California’s Central Valley. The Corps is encouraged to coordinate
with the potential non-federal sponsor to identify opportunities to
advance to the study authorized in WRDA 2024.

Flash Flood Preparedness.—Significant flash flooding across the
Nation has led to devastating loss of life and damage to commu-
nities across the Nation. The Committee is aware of the technical
expertise the Corps maintains in evaluating and managing flooding
risk in flash-flood-prone systems and responding to related emer-
gency situations. To the extent requested by non-federal entities,
the Corps shall prioritize technical assistance, as appropriate and
in the manner and to the extent authorized in law, through pro-
grams such as Flood Plain Management Services to assist state
and local governments in understanding their flash flood risk as
well as preparing for and managing flash flooding incidents, using
the best available science and hydrological maps. The Corps is fur-
ther encouraged to prioritize authorized studies and projects with
willing non-federal sponsors that would provide flood risk manage-
ment in areas susceptible to such events. The Corps shall provide
to the Committee, not later than 180 days after enactment of this
Act, a briefing on the utilization of existing programs to manage
risk associated with flash flooding and opportunities for additional
collaboration with interagency partners, such as the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States Geological
Survey, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to better
identify, characterize, prepare for, and respond to such storm
events.
Honolulu Harbor Modification and Coastal Storm Risk Manage-
ment Study, HI.—The Committee recognizes the importance of
completing the ongoing study and further notes the criticality of
the harbor to the State. The vast majority of imports move through
Honolulu Harbor, and the harbor supports U.S. national security,
military readiness, and force projection throughout the Indo-Pacific.
The Corps is directed to provide to the Committee not later than
180 days after the date of enactment of this Act a briefing on the
status of the study and the extent to which the Corps may account
for national security benefits.
Lake Tohopekaliga, FL Sediment Removal.—The Committee is
aware of shoaling in Lake Tohopekaliga driven by Hurricane Ian
and sediment having moved through the Kissimmee chain of lakes.
The Corps is encouraged to coordinate with state and local officials
on opportunities to mitigate shoaling in this area.
Lower San Joaquin River (Lathrop & Manteca), CA.—The Corps
is reminded that this project is eligible to compete for the addi-
tional funding provided in this account and encouraged to include
appropriate funding in future budget submissions.
Matagorda Ship Channel, TX.—The Committee understands the
significant economic impact of Lavaca Bay on the U.S. economy
and notes the importance of ensuring its competitiveness for global
commerce. The Committee continues to monitor the status of the
Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project and is concerned
over repeated delays to its completion. The Committee understands
that the Corps has all necessary funding to complete the Supple-
mental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) and the validation
study necessary to resume progress on engineering and design
work and ultimately prepare for initiation of construction. The
Committee urges quick completion of the SEIS and validation
study. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committee not later
than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act a briefing on

is provided to continue progress on the Low-Head Dam Inventory.
New York-New Jersey Harbor and Tributaries, NY and NJ.—The
Committee is aware of the ongoing study and its significance for
the region. The Corps is encouraged to include appropriate funding
in future budget submissions.
Planning Assistance to States, Vulnerable Coastal Commu-
nities.—The Committee notes the important role the Corps plays in
managing flood risk and threats from coastal hazards and that the
Planning Assistance to States program provides in assisting with
comprehensive plans and technical assistance to eligible state, trib-
al, or U.S. territory partners. The Committee encourages the Corps
to continue building capacity to provide this assistance to vulner-
able coastal communities, including tribal, Alaskan Native, and
Native Hawaiian communities. Within funds provided, the Corps is
directed to prioritize technical assistance to federally recognized
tribes located on the coast that are actively working to relocate or
address issues due to continued high lift safety risks from flooding
and storm surge, or to improve coastal resiliency, that include but
are not limited to studies, surveys, and rates of erosion of land
being evaluated for relocation.
Pine Flat Dam Raise, CA.—The Committee is aware of a pending
study to assess the feasibility of raising Pine Flat Dam. The Corps
is encouraged to include appropriate funding in future budget sub-
missions.
Remote Sensing/Geographic Information System Support.—With-
in available funds, $2,100,000 shall be for the Corps to continue
procurement efforts for advanced integrated GPS and optical sur-
veying and mapping equipment. This funding increase shall be
competitively awarded or provided to programs that have received
competitive awards in the past.
The recommendation includes $2,000,000 to evaluate the transi-
tion of small unmanned aircraft system technology onto larger
Group 3 and Group 4 aircraft. The Corps is encouraged to collabo-
rate with university partners, particularly those with the requisite
experience operating these larger aircraft and that meet any rel-
evant Federal Aviation Administration requirements necessary to
conduct this research.
Research and Development.—The Committee is aware of high-
priority research and development needs and the value of
leveraging university partnerships to address the highest priority
challenges impacting the Corps’ civil works mission. The Corps is
encouraged to work with university partners to evaluate develop-
ment of new construction automation technologies utilizing ultra
high-performance concrete. The Corps is further encouraged to as-
sess the impacts to the national dredging program of freight flow
across a multimodal and marine transportation system. The Corps
shall provide to the Committee not later than 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act a briefing on its continued efforts to
build out the business case for its research and development activi-
ties, which shall include an assessment of the value of a Marine
Transportation Synthesis with Multimodal Freight Network re-
search effort.

encouraged to work with university and industry partners to assess
the application of fiber reinforced plastic composites for the replace-
ment of aging steel infrastructure.
San Diego County Shoreline (Oceanside) Mitigation, CA (Section
414).—The Corps is reminded that WRDA 2022 and WRDA 2024
directed expeditious completion of this study and that this Com-
mittee has been supportive of maintaining progress on this study.
However, the Committee is also aware that the City of Oceanside
opposes the construction of groins in association with this effort.
The Corps is strongly encouraged to work with the non-federal
sponsor to explore alternative project formulations that avoid the
construction of groins without incurring additional costs to the tax-
payer.
San Juan-Chuma Project.—The Corps is directed to provide to
the Committee not later than 90 days after the date of enactment
of this Act a joint briefing consistent with the direction under this
same heading contained within ‘‘Water and Related Resources’’.
Upper St. Anthony Falls.—The Corps is reminded that the Upper
St. Anthony Falls project remains an authorized federal project and
is encouraged to continue to operate and maintain the lock to keep
it in a state of good repair. The Corps is directed to provide to the
Committee not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of
this Act a briefing on the schedule for the disposition study, real
estate requirements for ongoing maintenance activities and alter-
natives that could allow for appropriate maintenance levels, and
the Corps’ role once the disposition study is completed.
CONSTRUCTION

the extent authorized in law, to streamline this process by dele-
gating greater authority to local project officials to initiate and
manage such transfers without requiring additional approval from
headquarters.
Burns Waterway Harbor, IN.—The Corps is reminded that this
project is eligible to compete for the additional funding provided in
this account and is encouraged to include appropriate funding in
future budget submissions.
Coastal Inlets Research Program.—Funding above the budget re-
quest is included for the Corps-led, multi-university effort to iden-
tify engineering frameworks to address coastal resilience needs; to
develop adaptive pathways that lead to coastal resilience; to meas-
ure the coastal forces that lead to infrastructure damage and ero-
sion during extreme storm events; and to improve coupling of ter-
restrial and coastal models.
Dredging Operations Technical Support (DOTS), Digital Twins.—
The Committee is deeply concerned with catastrophic failures on
the Tennessee-Tombigbee and Black Warrior-Tombigbee systems.
The Corps must do more to develop a comprehensive strategy to
monitor, detect, and address potentials for failure before they
occur. The recommendation includes $1,500,000 to develop a digital
twin for the inland waterways system. The Corps has undertaken
efforts to aid in underwater scans and mapping of lock systems in
a variety of funding line items, such as Asset Management/FEM,
Monitoring of Completed Navigation Project, and DOTS itself. The
Corps is directed to pursue these research and development efforts
as part of a comprehensive strategy towards prevention of, not re-
sponse to, catastrophic failure. The Corps is further directed pro-
vide to the Committee not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act a briefing on further research required to better
characterize concrete failure and how those risks can be identified
before failure occurs. Finally, the Corps shall prioritize efforts to
develop suitable underwater inspection techniques that will be
deployable on a national basis to supplement or replace, as appro-
priate, inspection methods that rely on dewatering of lock cham-
bers. The recommendation also includes $1,500,000 to develop a
digital twin for the national dredging program.
Engineering With Nature.—The recommendation provides
$12,500,000 for the Engineering With Nature (EWN) initiative, of
which $5,000,000 is to support ongoing research with university
partners.

quired emergency interventions to maintain operability. The Corps
is encouraged to prioritize maintenance dredging along the water-
way to ensure year-round navigability and prevent interruptions to
critical operations.
Lake Providence Harbor, LA.—The Committee is aware of the
importance of Lake Providence Harbor in transporting critical com-
modities and supplies. The Committee notes the desire for the port
to be fully operational during agricultural harvest season. The
Committee directs the Corps to perform the necessary dredging
prior to the beginning of harvest season, to the extent practicable,
to minimize potential economic impacts.
Levee Maintenance Requirements.—The Committee continues to
hear concerns from levee districts regarding new requirements,
rules, and guidelines related to levee inspections and the related
levee accreditation process. The Congress has invested significant
resources in many of the impacted levee systems to provide flood
protection for those communities. The Corps shall collaborate with
levee operators and incorporate their views on the economic impact
of increasing requirements. Within available funds, the Corps is di-
rected to establish a Levee Owners Board (Board) in a manner con-
sistent with existing authorities and that shall represent the views
of levee sponsors across the nation. The Corps shall solicit and, to
the extent practicable and authorized in law, incorporate the views
of the Board regarding the effectiveness of the levee safety pro-
gram, levee safety initiative established by section 9005 of WRDA
2007, and new requirements or procedures related to the Corps’
role in levee inspections and accreditations. The Board shall be dis-
tinct from the Committee on Levee Safety. The Corps shall provide
to the Committee not later than 180 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act a briefing on the proposed structure of the Board
and implementation of this provision.
Monitoring of Completed Navigation Projects, Fisheries.—The
Committee continues to support research to mitigate the impacts
of reduced lock operations on certain fish species. Within available
funds, $4,000,000 shall be to continue research to assist the Corps
across all waterways, lock structures, lock operation methods, and
fish species that will more fully inform Corps’ operations. In addi-
tion, $2,000,000 shall be for the National Informational Collabora-
tion for Ecohydraulics effort by the Corps to research the impact
of reduced lock operations on riverine fish.
Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) Use on Water Resources Development
Lands.—The Committee is aware of public frustration regarding
the recently developed management plan for Jennings Randolph
Lake in West Virginia. The Committee supports public access for
a variety of modes of outdoor recreation, to include OHV use where
appropriate and consistent with authorized project purposes. The
Corps is encouraged to conduct outreach with the local community
and explore opportunities to permit appropriate OHV use.
Ohio Harbors.—Toledo Harbor and the channel at the mouth of
western Lake Erie serve as a major thoroughfare to the Great
Lakes navigation system, supporting manufacturing and commerce
throughout the region. Neighboring harbors are key components of
the Great Lakes navigation system and support economic activity
in the region. The Corps is reminded that the Toledo, Huron, Port
Clinton, Lorain, and Sandusky Harbors are eligible to compete for

additional funding in this account; that Sandusky, Lorain, and
Huron qualify as emerging harbors; and that emerging harbors
must be prioritized for funding, as appropriate. In addition, the
Corps is directed to maximize beneficial use of dredged material
under the base plan for these harbors in accordance with section
8130(b) of WRDA 2022. In furtherance of this goal, the Committee
encourages the Corps to consider the use of dredged material to
fortify Lake Erie shorelines against damage from seasonal high
water in accordance with section 8102(b) of WRDA 2022, if the
Governor requests assistance.
Pine Flat Lake, CA.—The Committee is aware of several ongoing
efforts to better characterize and reduce flood risk along the Kings
River and directs the Corps to coordinate with local stakeholders
on these efforts. The Corps is urged to make expeditious progress
on any scheduled updates to the water control manual for the
project.
Recreational Facilities.—The Corps is one of the Nation’s largest
providers of conventional outdoor recreation opportunities, and the
Committee recognizes the important role that the Corps plays in
providing recreational opportunities to the public. The Committee
remains concerned that the Corps has not done enough to leverage
non-federal concessionaires in service of its recreation mission, in-
cluding by evaluating alternative lease terms and conditions. The
Corps is urged to consider alternative arrangements that continue
proper stewardship of taxpayer funds while maximizing flexibility
for concessionaires to procure appropriate financing and enhance
the opportunities they afford to the recreating public.
Recreation Management Support Program.—The recommendation
includes $1,500,000 to support implementation of Public Law 117–
114.
Regional Sediment Management Program, Integrated Tools.—
Within available funds, $1,000,000 shall be to continue develop-
ment of integrated tools that build coastal resilience across naviga-
tion, flood risk management, and ecosystem projects within the
program.
Regional Sediment Management, Modeling.—Within available
funds, $2,600,000 shall be to support ongoing research into geo-
chemical, geophysical, and sedimentological analysis and modeling
which will help the Corps assess strategies to mitigate related
changes and to detect and prevent adverse consequences of engi-
neering solutions. It is understood that this effort will be completed
in 2030.
Remote Lock Operations.—The Committee is concerned with un-
certainties and unknowns in the Corps’ plans to implement remote
operations for mission-critical navigational locks and dams and hy-
droelectric dams. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committee
not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act a
briefing on its plans to mitigate and manage operational, environ-
mental, and budgetary risks associated with remote operation of
critical infrastructure, including physical security vulnerabilities,
cybersecurity risks, and threats to the Nation’s economic stability
and homeland security from adversarial Nations and non-state ac-
tors.

issues due to irregular maintenance dredging. The Corps is encour-
aged to evaluate additional measures, such as alternative dredging
and disposal measures, including beneficial use of dredged mate-
rial, that would promote maintenance dredging on more appro-
priate intervals and facilitate economic development and port oper-
ations.
Stakeholder Engagement.—The Committee recognizes the essen-
tial work the Corps does to maintain the integrity of its locks,
dams, and other water navigation structures and the importance of
those structures to the public. The Committee is aware that any
waterway maintenance closures significantly impact local commu-
nities and businesses, including the agricultural sector. The Corps
is directed to consult with local industrial stakeholders, including
those in the agricultural sector, prior to the announcement of the
closure of major waterways and significant work on locks, dams,
and other water navigation structures that may impact navigation
for an extended period.
Special Recreation User Fees.—Section 1154 of WRDA 2024 es-
tablished a new mechanism for Corps projects to make use of fees
collected on site during the fiscal year, requiring at least 80 percent
of fees generated at a project to be retained for use at the same
project. The recommendation makes available the full amount of
special recreation user fees collected in fiscal year 2026, estimated
to total $67,000,000. The amount specified for this Remaining Item
is an estimate of fiscal year 2026 collections and shall not be con-
strued as a limitation on the availability of collections.
While shown in a Remaining Item, all such fees collected in fiscal
year 2026 shall be made available for use at specific projects as au-
thorized in law. All amounts derived from fees collected in fiscal
year 2026 and necessary to meet the 80 percent minimum shall be
available for expenditure at the project where such fees are col-
lected as soon as practicable. Not later than the first day of the sec-
ond quarter of fiscal year 2027, the Secretary shall submit to the
Committee a report delineating the total amount that was esti-
mated to be collected in fees at the start of fiscal year 2026, in total
and delineated by project, and the final collection and project-spe-
cific allocation totals for fiscal year 2026.
Table Rock Lake, MO and AR.—The Committee is aware of con-
tinued disputes between the Corps and property owners regarding
existing residential structures in the vicinity of the project. The
Corps is reminded that WRDA 2024 permitted the continued pres-
ence of certain existing structures for human habitation, which in-
cluded but was not limited to related septic systems.
Water Operations Technical Support (WOTS), Forecast-Informed
Reservoir Operations (FIRO).—Within available funds, $12,000,000
shall be to continue progress on the FIRO research program. None
of the funds recommend in the WOTS line item may be used for
the Snow-Informed Reservoir Operations research effort except to
the extent snowpack and winter weather analysis is incorporated
into the pre-existing FIRO effort.
The Corps is strongly encouraged to coordinate with the Bureau
of Reclamation to take the steps necessary to initiate a FIRO as-
sessment of Lake Shasta.
The Committee notes the forthcoming conclusion of the current
phase of the FIRO effort. The Corps is directed to provide to the

Committee not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of
this Act a briefing on the next steps for FIRO, how FIRO can be-
come integrated into water control manual updates moving forward
and on a national basis, the transferability of tools developed or
other results of the research, and related future funding require-
ments.
WOTS, Managed Aquifer Recharge.—Within available funds, not
less than $700,000 shall be to implement sections 8108(a), 8108(c),
and 8108(d) of WRDA 2022, of which, not less than $150,000 shall
be for the national assessment authorized in section 8108(a).
REGULATORY PROGRAM
This appropriation provides funds to administer laws pertaining
to the regulation of activities affecting U.S. waters, including wet-
lands, in accordance with the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation
Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, and the Marine Protection, Re-
search, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. Appropriated funds are used
to review and process permit applications, ensure compliance on
permitted sites, protect important aquatic resources, and support
watershed planning efforts in sensitive environmental areas in co-
operation with states and local communities. The Committee rec-
ommends $221,000,000 for the Regulatory Program.
Waters of the United States (WOTUS).—The Committee is
pleased that the Corps and the United States Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (Agency) are working together to review and reissue
a new definition of ‘‘waters of the United States’’ to conform with
the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. The committee urges the Corps to prioritize this re-
view and reissuance in order to provide clarity and regulatory cer-
tainty for farmers, ranchers, developers, and landowners. In the in-
terim, the Committee encourages the Corps to work with the Agen-
cy to ensure timely processing of jurisdictional determinations.
FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM
This appropriation funds the cleanup of certain low-level radio-
active materials and mixed wastes located at sites contaminated as
a result of the Nation’s early efforts to develop atomic weapons.
The Committee recommends no new funding for Formerly Utilized
Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP).
The Committee recognizes the importance of FUSRAP work to
clean up sites throughout the United States that were contami-
nated as a result of the Nation’s early atomic weapons and energy
programs. The Committee understands that the Corps will carry
over into fiscal year 2026 significant unobligated funds sufficient to
make appropriate progress on all active FUSRAP sites. The Com-
mittee must make difficult tradeoffs to prioritize the greatest needs
in a fiscally responsible manner. As such, the Committee includes
no new funding for FUSRAP sites and expects the Corps to make
expeditious progress within available funds from prior years.
The Committee continues to support the prioritization of sites,
especially those that are nearing completion. The Committee is
aware that the Corps is completing the Feasibility Study, a Pro-
posed Plan, and a draft Record of Decision in fiscal year 2026 and
is planning to complete and release the Record of Decision in fiscal
year 2026 for the former Sylvania nuclear fuel site at Hicksville,

New York. The Committee encourages the Corps to proceed expedi-
tiously, as appropriate, to complete and release the Record of Deci-
sion so that a remedy for cleanup can begin in accordance with the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Li-
ability Act (CERCLA). As the Corps completes the Record of Deci-
sion, the Committee encourages the Corps to work with the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) to fully encompass and address
all on-site and off-site groundwater contamination related to the
former Sylvania nuclear fuel site at Hicksville, New York.
The Committee is concerned by the recent reporting of high lev-
els of radioactivity in the groundwater around the Luckey Site. The
Corps is directed to conduct appropriate sampling and testing of
the Luckey Site and adjacent properties. Further, the Corps shall
brief the Committee on the results of this analysis no later than
90 days after the enactment of this Act.
FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES
This appropriation funds planning, training, and other measures
that ensure the readiness of the Corps to respond to floods, hurri-
canes, and other natural disasters, and to support emergency oper-
ations in response to such natural disasters, including advance
measures, flood fighting, emergency operations, the provision of po-
table water on an emergency basis, and the repair of certain flood
and storm damage reduction projects. The Committee recommends
$40,000,000 for Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies.
EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
This appropriation funds the executive direction and manage-
ment of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, the Division Offices,
and certain research and statistical functions of the Corps. The
Committee recommends $226,000,000 for Expenses.
Bill language is included to transfer Expenses funds to the re-
volving fund to support dredge recapitalization. The Corps has mis-
managed the revolving fund and engaged in efforts to encourage
additional appropriations to offset that mismanagement. The Corps
seems to expect the general taxpayer to finance these program
management failures. Corps leadership will finance its own fail-
ures.
Recent reprogramming actions have highlighted an oversight
failure on the part of Division Offices and Headquarters to monitor
expenditure of funds at the District level. The Corps is reminded
that the oldest funds associated with projects should be used first.
The Corps is directed to develop an oversight plan to ensure proper
use of aged funds and provide to the Committee not later than 120
days after the date of enactment of this Act its implementation
plan. The Corps is further reminded that notification requirements
in this Act and the report accompanying this Act, while required
to ensure transparency, do not preclude nor replace proper,
proactive communication on significant issues related to the Com-
mittee’s prerogatives.
Of the amount provided, not less than $500,000 is included for
costs to update Corps guidance as necessary to implement its policy
requiring a class 3 cost estimate prior to completion of the feasi-

bility phase. In addition to considerations emphasized in the June
2023 memorandum clarifying implementation of ER 1110–2–1302,
updated guidance shall include appropriate policies to ensure envi-
ronmental mitigation requirements and site conditions, to include
utility mapping and analysis of existing infrastructure in the
project footprint, are adequately understood during feasibility. The
Corps cannot approve a feasibility study as complete nor advance
to a Chief’s Report recommending a project for construction until
project design has advanced sufficiently to support a class 3 cost
estimate. Hereafter, the Corps shall not express capability for a
construction new start for a project without having achieved and
maintained a class 3 cost estimate for that entire project unless the
Corps reasonably expects to achieve a class 3 cost estimate within
the same fiscal year for which construction capability is expressed.
Discretionary approval authority to provide exemptions to these re-
quirements remains with the Chief of Engineers, in coordination
with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and such
exemptions shall be incorporated into written policy updates. Any
exemptions should address requirements to pursue appropriate use
of contractor-at-risk and alternative procurement strategies to the
traditional design-bid-build approach.
Responsiveness to Congressional Inquiries.—The Committee notes
that Corps Districts utilize different processes and procedures to
communicate with congressional offices regarding projects and ini-
tiatives of interest. While some Districts communicate with con-
gressional offices effectively, the Committee has heard concerns
that these best practices are not employed nationwide. The Com-
mittee expects Corps Districts to be responsive to congressional in-
quiries and directs the Corps to provide to the Committee not later
than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act a briefing on
a plan to improve communication between Corps Districts and
members of Congress. Further, the Corps shall consider estab-
lishing a dedicated public engagement team to improve early public
outreach during project formulation.
Sault Ste. Marie (Soo Locks) Employee Compensation Adjust-
ments.—The Committee is aware the Department of Defense’s
wage scale adjustment has negatively impacted salaries for govern-
ment employees at Soo Locks. The Committee understands the
highly specialized nature of these positions and is concerned that
this action imposes both hardship on these employees and could
pose a risk to retention, hiring, and to the Corps’ ability to meet
operational requirements at a facility that is critical to domestic
supply chains. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committee
not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act a
briefing on the status of any efforts related to a special salary rate.
The Corps is encouraged to develop enterprise-wide best prac-
tices and ongoing oversight thereof across Districts and Divisions
to ensure consistency and effectiveness of public outreach.
Workforce Development in the Indo-Pacific.—The Committee is
supportive of the Corps’ mission in the Indo-Pacific and aware of
the acute workforce challenges in U.S. territories and insular
areas. The Committee is aware that workforce development in
these areas can play an important role in competition with foreign
adversaries vying for influence in the region. The Corps is directed
to provide to the Committee not later than 180 days after the date

of enactment of this Act a briefing on current workforce challenges
and opportunities for the Corps to aid in workforce development to
the benefit of the civil works mission and American interests. The
Corps is further directed to evaluate its footprint in U.S. territories
and insular areas and identify any efficiencies that could be
achieved by the establishment of offices, task forces, or other dedi-
cated teams focused on or located in these areas, including an eval-
uation needs in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS
The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works oversees the
civil works budget and policy, whereas the Corps’ executive direc-
tion and management of the civil works program are funded from
the Expenses account. The Committee recommends $6,000,000 for
Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.
The recommendation includes legislative language restricting the
availability of 75 percent of the funding provided in this account
until such time as at least 95 percent of the additional funding pro-
vided in each account has been allocated to specific programs,
projects, or activities. This restriction shall not affect the roles and
responsibilities established in previous fiscal years of the Office of
the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Corps
headquarters, the Corps field operating agencies, or any other exec-
utive branch agency.
The Committee counts on a timely and accessible executive
branch in the course of fulfilling its constitutional role in the ap-
propriations process. The requesting and receiving of basic, factual
information, such as budget justification materials and statutorily
required reports, including execution reports and damage repair es-
timates, is vital to maintain a transparent and open governing
process. The Committee appreciates the progress made on submit-
ting these reports and improvements in providing this factual infor-
mation necessary for informed decision making. The Committee
looks forward to continued progress and expects these reports to be
submitted on a regular and timely basis.
The Committee supports efforts to identify the federal interest in
authorized projects in advance of committing resources toward
their execution. The Secretary is directed to finalize implementa-
tion guidance in fiscal year 2026 for section 8156 of WRDA 2022.
This authority provides flexibility to the Corps in managing the
scope of the civil works program and early clarity for non-federal
sponsors.
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION PROGRAM
The financial assistance the Secretary is authorized to provide
pursuant to the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(Public Law 113–121) (WIFIA) can play an important role in im-
proving the Nation’s infrastructure. The Committee recommends
$5,000,000 for WIFIA. These funds are provided for program devel-
opment, administration, and oversight of loans and loan guarantees
associated with previously appropriated funds. Language is in-
cluded permitting the Corps to collect and expend fees, as author-
ized by law.
The Committee notes the expansion of this program in the fiscal
year 2024 Act to provide assistance for non-federal levees. The

Corps has not developed a concrete plan to incorporate such
projects into the existing program and there is no clear timeline for
execution of the funds made available for this purpose. The Com-
mittee awaits details on how the Corps plans to execute prior-year
funds prior to providing additional funding. To the extent prac-
ticable, the Corps shall prioritize coordination with potential non-
federal sponsors for non-federal levee projects that offer the great-
est potential risk reduction to public safety. The Corps is directed
to provide to the Committee prior to any announcements of awards
or invitations to apply a briefing on the related forthcoming action.
GENERAL PROVISIONS—CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Section 101 continues a provision that prohibits the obligation or
expenditure of funds through a reprogramming of funds in this
title except in certain circumstances. For projects receiving addi-
tional allocations derived from recreation fees collected in fiscal
year 2026 pursuant to section 1154 of WRDA 2024, the reprogram-
ming baseline for each such project shall include such fees. For fee-
generating projects, immediately upon enactment of this Act, an
amount equal to 80 percent of the fees estimated to be collected
during fiscal year 2026 shall be added to the reprogramming base-
lines for those projects. All special recreation user fees collected
during fiscal year 2026 shall be allocated to specific projects prior
to the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2027, and any such
amounts that remain unobligated at that time shall be added to
the fiscal year 2027 reprogramming baselines for those projects. All
such amounts shall be reflected in the report required pursuant to
section 101(d) for the appropriate fiscal year.
Section 102 continues a provision regarding the allocation of
funds.
Section 103 continues a provision prohibiting the use of funds in
this Act to carry out any contract that commits funds beyond the
amounts appropriated for that program, project, or activity. The
award of a continuing contract with an incremental funding clause
shall not, in and of itself, constitute a conflict with section 103.
Section 104 continues a provision authorizing the transfer of
funds to the Fish and Wildlife Service to mitigate for fisheries lost
due to Corps projects.
Section 105 continues a provision regarding certain dredged ma-
terial disposal activities. The Committee is aware of certain issues
regarding placement of dredge material.
Section 106 continues a provision regarding reallocations at a
project.
Section 107 continues a provision regarding eligibility for addi-
tional funding. Whether a project is eligible for funding under a
particular provision of additional funding is a function of the tech-
nical details of the project; it is not a policy decision. The Chief of
Engineers is the federal government’s technical expert responsible
for execution of the civil works program and for offering profes-
sional advice on its development. Therefore, the provision clarifies
that a project’s eligibility for additional funding shall be solely the
professional determination of the Chief of Engineers.

TITLE II—DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT
CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT COMPLETION ACCOUNT
The Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) (Titles II–VI
of Public Law 102–575) provides for the completion of the Central
Utah Project by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District.
CUPCA also authorizes the appropriation of funds for fish, wildlife,
and recreation mitigation and conservation; establishes an account
in the Treasury for the deposit of these funds and of other con-
tributions for mitigation and conservation activities; and estab-
lishes a Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commis-
sion to administer funds in that account. CUPCA further assigns
responsibilities for carrying out the Act to the Secretary of the Inte-
rior and prohibits delegation of those responsibilities to the Bureau
of Reclamation.
The Committee recommends $23,000,000 for the Central Utah
Project Completion Account, which includes $17,050,000 for Cen-
tral Utah Project construction, $4,000,000 for transfer to the Utah
Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Account for use by the
Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission, and
$1,900,000 for necessary expenses of the Secretary of the Interior.
BUREAU OF RECLAMATION
INTRODUCTION
The mission of the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is to de-
velop, manage, and protect water and related resources in an envi-
ronmentally and economically sound manner in the interest of the
American public. Since its establishment by the Reclamation Act of
1902, Reclamation has developed water supply facilities that have
contributed to sustained economic growth and an enhanced quality
of life in the western states. Lands and communities served by Rec-
lamation projects have been developed to meet agricultural, tribal,
urban, and industrial needs. Reclamation continues to develop au-
thorized facilities to store and convey new water supplies and is
the largest supplier and manager of water in the 17 western states
Reclamation maintains 338 reservoirs with the capacity to store
140 million acre-feet of water.
While hydrology in certain western states has improved dramati-
cally, other regions continue to experience severe and exceptional
drought. Infrastructure investments are critical to secure water re-
sources for both municipal and agricultural usage now and into the
future. Accordingly, the Committee recommendation includes tar-
geted, increased investments in programs to assist western states
as they respond to the drought crisis and continues to build on
long-term efforts to address future challenges.
As Reclamation’s facilities reach their design life, the projected
cost of operating, maintaining, and rehabilitating this infrastruc-

ture continues to grow, yet Reclamation has not budgeted sufficient
funding to implement a comprehensive program to reduce its main-
tenance backlog. At the same time, Reclamation is increasingly re-
lied upon to supply water to federally-recognized Indian tribes
through water settlements, rural communities through its Title I
Rural Water Program, and municipalities through its Title XVI
Water Reclamation and Reuse Program. Balancing these competing
priorities will be challenging and requires active participation and
leadership on the part of Reclamation and its technical staff.
WATER AND RELATED RESOURCES
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The Water and Related Resources account supports the develop-
ment, construction, management, and restoration of water and re-
lated natural resources in the 17 western states. The account in-
cludes funds for operating and maintaining existing facilities to ob-
tain the greatest overall levels of benefits, to protect public safety,
and to conduct studies on ways to improve the use of water and
related natural resources.
The Committee recommends $1,710,630,000 for Water and Re-
lated Resources. The budget request for this account and the ap-
proved Committee allowance are shown on the following table:

Additional Funding for Water and Related Resources Work.—The
recommendation includes funds above the budget request for Water
and Related Resources studies, projects, and activities. Reclamation
is urged to give priority in allocating these funds to advancing and
completing ongoing work, including preconstruction activities and
where environmental compliance has been completed; improve
water supply reliability; improve water deliveries; enhance na-
tional, regional, or local economic development; promote job growth;
advance tribal and nontribal water settlement studies and activi-
ties; or address critical backlog maintenance and rehabilitation ac-
tivities. Funding provided under this heading may be utilized for
ongoing work, including preconstruction activities, on projects that
provide new or existing water supplies through additional infra-
structure.
Of the additional funding provided under the heading ‘‘Water
Conservation and Delivery’’, $201,000,000 shall be for water stor-
age projects as authorized in section 4007 of Public Law 114–322.
Of the additional funding provided under the heading ‘‘Water
Conservation and Delivery’’, not less than $20,000,000 shall be for
planning, pre-construction, or construction activities related to
projects found to be feasible by the Secretary and that are ready
to be initiated for the repair of critical Reclamation canals where
operational conveyance capacity has been seriously impaired by
factors such as land subsidence, especially those that would immi-
nently jeopardize Reclamation’s ability to meet water delivery obli-
gations in drought prone states.
Of the additional funding provided under the heading ‘‘Water
Conservation and Delivery’’, not less than $50,000,000 shall be to
create or conserve recurring Colorado River water that contributes
to supplies in Lake Mead and other Colorado River water res-
ervoirs in the Lower Colorado River Basin or projects to improve
the long-term efficiency of operations in the Lower Colorado River
Basin. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting exist-
ing or future opportunities to augment the water supplies of the
Colorado River.
Of the additional funding provided under the heading ‘‘Water
Conservation and Delivery’’, not less than $50,000,000 shall be for
authorized Indian Water Rights Settlements.
Of the additional funding provided under the heading ‘‘Environ-
mental Restoration or Compliance’’, not less than $25,000,000 shall
be for planning, preconstruction, construction, and monitoring ac-
tivities authorized under sections 4001 and 4010 of the WIIN Act
or as set forth in Federal-State plans for enhancing threatened and
endangered fish species affected by the operation of Reclamation’s
water projects. To the extent practicable and authorized in law,
Reclamation is directed to prioritize aquatic habitat restoration ac-
tivities, fish hatchery modernization, and related efforts that en-
hance Reclamation’s ability to meet contractual obligations for
water deliveries. Reclamation is reminded that floodplain reconnec-
tion and reactivation projects are eligible to compete for the addi-
tional funding provided under the heading ‘‘Environmental Res-
toration or Compliance’’.
Not later than 45 days after the date of enactment of this Act,
Reclamation shall provide to the Committee a report delineating
how the additional funds in this account are to be distributed, in
VerDate Sep 11 2014 08:04 Jul 23, 2025 Jkt 061178 PO 00000 Frm 00080 Fmt 6659 Sfmt 6602 E:\HR\OC\HR213.XXX HR213

81
which phase the work is to be accomplished, and an explanation of
the criteria and rankings used to justify each allocation.
Reclamation is reminded that projects within the Anadromous
Fish Screen Program are eligible to compete for the additional
funding provided under ‘‘Fish Passage and Fish Screens’’. Reclama-
tion is also reminded that activities authorized under Indian Water
Rights Settlements and under section 206 of Public Law 113–235
are eligible to compete for the additional funding provided under
‘‘Water Conservation and Delivery’’.
The Committee provides additional funds for distinct categories
of work and expects Reclamation to adhere to those categories;
there is no overlap. Additionally, the Committee provides addi-
tional funds above the budget request to mitigate for the impacts
of inadequate budgeting for critical work. Reclamation has repeat-
edly made allocations from one funding line for activities appro-
priately funded through a different line. Reclamation’s failure to
budget for high-priority work in a particular category does not jus-
tify these actions, and the executive branch’s historical practice of
altering the balance between various mission areas as enacted into
law cannot continue. Furthermore, the Committee expects addi-
tional funding allocations to be made to specific projects, programs,
or activities. None of these funds may be used for research and de-
velopment activities.
Anadromous Fish Screen Program.—The Committee appreciates
Reclamation’s efforts to devote additional resources to completing
work on the last remaining priority unscreened diversions on the
Sacramento River, which are identified as priorities in the Cali-
fornia Natural Resources Agency Sacramento Valley Salmon Resil-
iency Strategy. Reclamation is encouraged to maintain its focus on
screening high priority diversions in the San Joaquin River Basin.
Central Valley Project.—The Committee is aware of economically
disadvantaged communities in the Central Valley of California.
Reclamation is encouraged to evaluate all tools at its disposal to
support these communities and enhance access to clean and reli-
able water supplies. Reclamation is directed to collaborate with
Stockton East Water District with respect to the district’s request
relating to the inclusion of new lands into its Central Valley
Project Service area.
Colorado River Basin Drought.—The Committee maintains inter-
est in the long-term drought afflicting the Colorado River Basin
and the Tribes, farmers, ecosystems, and communities that depend
on reliable water and power deliveries from the system. Reclama-
tion is encouraged to include in future budget submissions robust
funding for activities that promote voluntary water conservation
and enhance water supply infrastructure throughout the basin.
In addition, the Committee is aware of unavoidable deliveries of
water to Mexico in excess of treaty obligations. Additional infra-
structure in the Lower Basin could enable this water to be cap-
tured and utilized domestically. Reclamation is encouraged to con-
tinue to identify opportunities to support infrastructure develop-
ment to reduce such excess water deliveries. Reclamation is di-
rected to provide to the Committee not later than 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act a briefing on infrastructure needs,
funding requirements, and other tools already available to Rec-
lamation to reduce or eliminate these water deliveries to Mexico

and ensure all such deliveries are accounted for within the Mexican
entitlement.
Columbia Basin Project.—The Committee is aware of the Odessa
Ground Water Replacement Program within the Columbia Basin
Project to deliver surface water to the Odessa Subarea. The Sub-
area groundwater is being withdrawn at a rate beyond the aquifer’s
capacity to recharge, and aquifers in the Subarea are quickly de-
clining. Groundwater is virtually depleted to such an extent that
water must be pumped from wells as deep as 2,400 feet. Water
pumped from such depths is hot and has dangerously high sodium
concentrations. The Committee supports Reclamation’s partnership
in the program to provide farmlands in Central and Eastern Wash-
ington with surface water supply through operational changes in
the storage and delivery system and urges Reclamation to move
forward to implement the program.
The Committee understands the importance of continuing to
build out the Columbia Basin Project. Reclamation is directed to
provide to the Committee not later than 180 days after the date of
enactment of this Act a briefing on the costs and benefits of contin-
ued progress. The briefing shall consider impacts to local Tribal
populations, salmon habitat, agricultural production and employ-
ment, and food security.
Great Salt Lake Restoration.—The Committee is aware that ex-
tended drought caused the elevation of the Great Salt Lake (GSL)
to reach historic lows in 2022, and the State of Utah has responded
by developing a holistic approach to GSL stewardship that balances
the diverse factors related to lake health. The Committee notes the
recent Reclamation grant to the State of Utah to aid the Utah De-
partment of Natural Resources in implementing its plan to manage
the lake’s health. Reclamation shall evaluate opportunities to assist
and collaborate with the State of Utah regarding efforts to manage
lake levels and health without requiring involuntary water releases
from federal reservoirs. Reclamation is reminded that technical and
financial assistance related to infrastructure improvements, water
conservation, and improved wetlands management activities, to the
extent and in the manner authorized in law, may contribute to on-
going efforts to protect and enhance GSL health.
Inner Harbor Desalination.—The Committee is aware of efforts
underway by the city of Corpus Christi to develop seawater desali-
nation facilities to augment existing surface water supplies. Rec-
lamation is directed to collaborate with the city to identify opportu-
nities for technical and financial assistance that can expedite and
improve the efficiency of this effort.
Flathead Lake.—The Committee recognizes the extreme low
water in Flathead Lake during the 2023 season, which resulted in
property destruction, safety hazards, and decreased economic activ-
ity. To the extent authorized in law, Reclamation is encouraged to
collaborate with local water managers who request such assistance
on a voluntary basis to identify opportunities for technical assist-
ance that could support maintaining certain water levels for rec-
reational uses while appropriately balancing multiple uses of the
resource.
Research and Development (R&D).—The Committee applauds
Reclamation’s ongoing work to support water managers through
participation in the development of water management decision

support tools to balance competing demands and maximize water
supplies. Reclamation is encouraged to collaborate with local stake-
holders to develop a decision support system for agricultural pro-
ducers, water allocation managers, fisheries managers, and
recreationalists to maximize efficient water use in the Upper Mis-
souri Watershed.
In addition, the Committee has invested significant resources in
the Corps-led Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations research ini-
tiative, which has benefitted Reclamation’s mission. Reclamation is
directed to provide to the Committee not later than 180 days after
the date of enactment of this Act a report that quantifies the eco-
nomic value of the water supply benefits of this research.
R&D, Desalination and Water Purification Program.—The rec-
ommendation provides $18,000,000 for desalination projects as au-
thorized in section 4009(a) of Public Law 114–322.
R&D, Science and Technology Program.—The Committee re-
mains supportive of innovative solutions to water management
challenges and appreciates the promise of technologies that can
maximize use of existing ambient moisture in a responsible man-
ner. Reclamation is encouraged to collaborate with water managers
and academic and industry partners to evaluate the application of
commercially available and novel technologies to its existing mis-
sions. Reclamation shall provide to the Committee not later than
180 days after the date of enactment of this Act a briefing on the
applicability of technology that could support conjunctive manage-
ment of ambient moisture with surface water storage and supplies
and additional authorities that may be required for its optimal in-
tegration.
R&D, Science and Technology Program: Airborne Snow Observ-
atory (ASO) Program.—The recommendation includes $3,000,000
for this program to support only additional ASO flights.
Rio Grande Valley Water Resources.—Reclamation is directed
provide to the Committee not later than 180 days after the date of
enactment of this Act a briefing providing an overview of drought
conditions in the Rio Grande watershed, current uses of water re-
sources, and measures that can be implemented within Reclama-
tion’s mission areas to combat the impacts of drought on economic
activity, including through financial and technical assistance to
water users and local communities. The briefing shall also include
an evaluation of relevant authorities provided in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley Water Resources Conservation and Improvement
Act and opportunities to utilize or modify those authorities toward
the same ends.
Salton Sea.—The Committee remains interested in Reclamation’s
role in and plans for managing the air quality impacts of the esti-
mated 8.75 square miles of lands it owns that will emerge from the
receding Sea over the next decade. Reclamation is directed to pro-
vide to the Committee not later than 90 days after the date of en-
actment of this Act a briefing covering updated information on an-
ticipated exposed federal lands over the next decade and a funding
estimate associated with meeting its Salton Sea obligations.
San Juan-Chuma Project.—The Committee recognizes the impor-
tance of the project, which supports municipal and industrial, Trib-
al, and agricultural water uses while minimizing the need to pump
additional groundwater and enhancing fish and wildlife resources

in the watershed. The Committee is also aware of sedimentation in
the river following storm events in 2024 and the risks to reliable
water deliveries following wildland fires. The Committee under-
stands Reclamation is working with the Corps to address these
challenges and encourages Reclamation to continue collaboration
with federal and non-federal partners and address the sedimenta-
tion issue. Reclamation and the Corps are directed to provide to the
Committee not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of
this Act a joint briefing on the status of current and planned efforts
to address the challenges described as well as efforts to manage
and mitigate drought impacts to the local economy. Reclamation is
encouraged to include appropriate funding in future budget submis-
sions.
Voluntary Water Exchanges.—The Committee supports voluntary
water exchanges to maximize West-wide water resources but ap-
preciates the complexity of interstate exchanges. Reclamation is en-
couraged to facilitate voluntary water exchanges, to the extent and
in the manner authorized in law, particularly those transfers
leveraging investments in desalination or other supply augmenta-
tion projects. Reclamation is directed to provide to the Committee
not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act a
briefing on opportunities to utilize such voluntary water transfers
to alleviate drought conditions or conveyance limitations in Cali-
fornia and the Colorado River basin. The briefing shall include an
overview of the legal landscape governing interstate water trans-
fers.
WaterSMART Program.—While coordinating funding opportuni-
ties can maximize viable projects, make opportunities more acces-
sible, and provide for a more holistic assessment of proposed work,
Reclamation is reminded that the authorities for each program are
controlling for those awards. Reclamation is further reminded of
modifications to WaterSMART made by Public Law 117–58 and di-
rected to consider the full range of applicants, as appropriate and
as authorized in law.
Further, Reclamation is reminded that applications to support
infrastructure deployment related to precision irrigation, to include
conveyance, pressurized systems, digital modernization for automa-
tion, are eligible to compete for WaterSMART grants. The Com-
mittee is also aware of existing, locally led programs to incentivize
replacement of turf with less water intensive alternatives. To the
extent authorized in law and that any such efforts may enhance
Colorado River conservation objectives, Reclamation is encouraged
to collaborate with local governments and public water agencies in
support of these efforts.
WaterSMART Program, Cooperative Watershed Management.—
Reclamation is strongly encouraged to conduct additional outreach
on the program to regions with limited capacity to develop and im-
plement watershed-scale restoration and related projects. Reclama-
tion is encouraged to take these and other additional steps, includ-
ing offering multiple funding opportunities throughout the year
and finding efficiencies in the application process.
WaterSMART Program, Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse
Program.—Of the funding provided for this program, $30,000,000
shall be for water recycling and reuse projects as authorized in sec-
tion 4009(c) of Public Law 114–322. Reclamation is encouraged to

consider the extent to which projects selected for funding will assist
in remediation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from local
water sources.
Reclamation is reminded of its existing authority to assist with
planning of non-federal desalination projects. Additional funding is
recommended for this purpose.
Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project.—The Com-
mittee is supportive of the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan, devel-
oped to address water storage, water supply, and fishery and eco-
system restoration needs for agriculture, fish, and municipalities
within the Yakima River Basin in Central Washington and author-
ized by Public Law 116–9. Reclamation is encouraged to make ex-
peditious progress on implementation and include appropriate
funding in future budget submissions.
Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District.—The Committee supports on-
going projects to remediate the irrigation district’s canal from dam-
ages sustained by the Retreat Fire in 2024. The Committee re-
mains concerns about the safety and potential for failure of the
canal and reminds Reclamation of available funding opportunities,
the Aging Infrastructure Account, to address these infrastructure
challenges. Reclamation is further reminded that this work is eligi-
ble to compete for the additional funding provided in this account.
Reclamation is urged to make expeditious progress.
CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT RESTORATION FUND
This fund was established to carry out the provisions of the Cen-
tral Valley Project Improvement Act and to provide funding for
habitat restoration, improvement and acquisition, and other fish
and wildlife restoration activities in the Central Valley area of
California. Resources are derived from donations, revenues from
voluntary water transfers and tiered water pricing, and Friant Di-
vision surcharges. The account is also financed through additional
mitigation and restoration payments collected on an annual basis
from project beneficiaries.
The Committee recommends an indefinite appropriation, which
allows Reclamation to expend funds collected in fiscal year 2026.
The estimate of collections in fiscal year 2026 is $65,370,000.
CALIFORNIA BAY-DELTA RESTORATION
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The California Bay-Delta Restoration account funds the federal
share of water supply and reliability improvements, ecosystem im-
provements, and other activities being developed for the Sac-
ramento-San Joaquin Delta and associated watersheds by a state
and federal partnership (CALFED). Federal participation in this
program was initially authorized in the California Bay-Delta Envi-
ronmental and Water Security Act enacted in 1996.
POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION
The Policy and Administration account provides for the executive
direction and management of all Reclamation activities, as per-
formed by the Commissioner’s office in Washington, D.C.; the Tech-
nical Service Center in Denver, Colorado; and in six regional of-
fices. The Denver and regional offices charge individual projects or

CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTION
Article I, section 9 of the United States Constitution states, ‘‘No
money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Ap-
propriations made by law.’’
The Committee continues to include the Department’s re-
programming authority in statute to ensure that the Department
carries out its programs consistent with congressional direction.
This reprogramming authority is established at the program,
project, or activity level, whichever is the most specific level of
budget items identified in this Act and the Committee report ac-
companying this Act. The Committee also prohibits new starts
through the use of reprogramming and includes other direction to
improve public oversight of the Department’s actions. In addition,
the recommendation continues to include a general provision speci-
fying which transfer authorities may be used for accounts funded
by this Act.
The Committee counts on a timely and accessible executive
branch in the course of fulfilling its constitutional role in the ap-
propriations process. Requesting and receiving basic, factual infor-
mation, including budget justification materials and responses to
inquiries, is vital to ensure transparency and accountability. While
some discussions internal to the executive branch may be pre-
decisional in nature, the Committee’s access to the facts, figures,
and statistics that inform the decisions of the executive branch are
not subject to the same sensitivities. The Committee shall have
ready and timely access to information from the Department, Fed-
erally Funded Research and Development Centers, and any recipi-
ent of funding from this Act. Further, the Committee appreciates
the ability for open and direct communication with all recipients of
funding from this Act, and the Department shall not interfere with
such communication and shall not penalize recipients of funding
from this Act for such communication.
REPROGRAMMING AND TRANSFER GUIDELINES
The Committee requires the Department to inform the Com-
mittee promptly when a change in program execution and funding
is required during the fiscal year. The Department’s reprogram-
ming requirements are detailed in the bill. To assist the Depart-
ment in this effort, the following guidance is provided for programs
and activities.
Definition.—A reprogramming includes the reallocation of funds
from one activity to another within an appropriation. The rec-
ommendation includes a general provision providing internal re-
programming authority to the Department, as long as no program,
project, or activity is increased or decreased by more than
$5,000,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less, compared to the levels
in the table detailing the Committee’s recommendations for the De-
partment’s various accounts. For construction projects, a re-
programming constitutes the reallocation of funds from one con-
struction project to another project or a change of $2,000,000 or 10
percent, whichever is less, in the scope of an approved project.
Criteria for Reprogramming.—A reprogramming should be made
only when an unforeseen situation arises, and then only if delay of
the project or activity until the next fiscal year would result in a

88
detrimental impact to an agency program or priority. A reprogram-
ming may also be considered if the Department can show that sig-
nificant cost savings can accrue by increasing funding for an activ-
ity. Mere convenience or preference shall not be a factor for consid-
eration. A reprogramming may not be employed to initiate new pro-
grams or to change program, project, or activity allocations specifi-
cally provided, denied, limited, or increased by the Congress in the
Act or report.
Reporting and Approval Procedures.—In recognition of the secu-
rity missions of the Department, the legislative guidelines allow
the Secretary and the Administrator of the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration jointly to waive the reprogramming restriction
by certifying to the Committee that it is in the Nation’s security
interest to do so. The Department shall not deviate from the levels
for activities specified in the report that are below the level of the
detail table, except through the regular notification procedures of
the Committee. No funds may be added to programs for which
funding has been denied. Any reallocation of new or prior-year
budget authority or prior-year de-obligations or any request to im-
plement a reorganization that includes moving previous appropria-
tions between appropriations accounts must be submitted to the
Committee in writing and shall not be implemented prior to ap-
proval by the Committee.
Transfers.—As in previous fiscal years, funding actions into or
out of accounts funded by this Act may only be made by transfer
authorities provided by this or other appropriations Acts.
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Commonly Recycled Paper.—The Department shall not expend
funds for projects that knowingly use as a feedstock commonly re-
cycled paper that is segregated from municipal solid waste or col-
lected as part of a collection system that commingles commonly re-
cycled paper with other solid waste at any point from the time of
collection through materials recovery.
Competitive Procedures.—The Department is directed, in align-
ment with section 989 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to use a
competitive, merit-based review process in carrying out research,
development, demonstration, and deployment activities, to the
maximum extent practicable. Further, the Department is directed
to notify the Committee at least 30 days prior to any noncompeti-
tive research, development, demonstration, or deployment award.
The Department shall include with the notification a copy of the
determination of noncompetitive financial assistance or justification
for other than full and open competition.
Congressional Reporting Requirements.—The Committee remains
concerned by the Department’s often lengthy delays in meeting its
Congressional reporting requirements. However, the Committee ap-
preciates the Department’s effort, led by the Office of the Chief Fi-
nancial Officer, to establish a tracking mechanism for all Congres-
sional reporting requirements. The Department is directed to pro-
vide quarterly updates to the Committee on this issue. Further, the
Department is directed to provide all congressionally required re-
ports in digital form.
Cost Share Waivers.—Section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of
2005 provides authority for the Secretary to waive cost share re-

89
quirements under some circumstances. The Department is directed
to notify the Committee at least 15 days prior to waiving cost share
requirements for any research, development, demonstration, or de-
ployment award.
Digital Infrastructure Technologies.—The Committee under-
stands the potential for digital infrastructure technologies, includ-
ing software and related services, to modernize and expand our Na-
tion’s current and future energy infrastructure and capacity. The
Committee directs the Department to consider new and innovative
ways to drive adoption of and integrate technologies that optimize
spending on equipment, construction, and materials to maximize
adaptability and longevity and drive additional efficiencies and cost
savings in areas that are prudent, such as financial assistance pro-
posals where digital infrastructure technologies are a plausible so-
lution.
Energy Conservation Standards.—The Committee applauds the
Administration’s efforts to eliminate or modify burdensome and
costly regulations, including dozens of energy conservation stand-
ards. Additionally, the Committee is encouraged by the Depart-
ment’s actions to delay compliance with certain energy conserva-
tion standards for manufactured housing, which could have signifi-
cant impacts on the manufactured housing market, to allow the
Department more time to evaluate appropriate next steps.
General Plant Projects.—In alignment with the requirements of
section 3118(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal
year 2010, the Department is directed to notify the Committee at
least 15 days prior to starting any General Plant Project unless the
project is directed by this recommendation or explicitly included in
the fiscal year 2026 budget request.
Hydrogen Hubs.—The Committee supports the Regional Hydro-
gen Hubs Program and notes the selection of seven Hydrogen Hubs
across the country to support the development of a diverse domes-
tic network of hydrogen producers, consumers, connective infra-
structure and the production, storage, delivery and of end-use of
hydrogen. The Committee supports the Hydrogen Hubs’ role in
achieving energy independence and domestic energy production.
Indirect Cost Rates.—The Committee is aware of the Depart-
ment’s recent policy flashes addressing maximum indirect cost
rates for institutions of higher education, state and local govern-
ments, for-profit entities, and nonprofit entities. The Committee
supports the Administration’s efforts to increase the accountability
of taxpayer resources and provide further transparency of facilities
and administrative costs of the Department’s grants. The Com-
mittee notes that the Department supports research and develop-
ment efforts across a vast range of scientific and technological pur-
suits. These pursuits often require specialized, proprietary, and
cutting-edge equipment. A blanket indirect cost rates policy, while
well-intentioned, does not fully address the unique nature of the
Department’s research and development work. The Committee di-
rects the Department to work with stakeholders to develop new in-
direct cost rates policies for each of the affected groups stated
above that better reflect the unique capabilities of entities that
support the Department’s research goals. The new policies shall
take into account previous indirect cost rates negotiations that
have been approved by the Department. The Committee directs the

90
Department to pause implementation of its previously announced
changes while it works to make these updates.
Mortgaging Future-Year Awards.—The Committee remains con-
cerned with the Department’s practice of making awards dependent
on funding from future years’ appropriations. The fiscal year 2022
Act directed the Department to provide a briefing on how it can
better track and provide information about the accounting of fu-
ture-year awards by control point. The Committee is still awaiting
this briefing and directs the Department to provide it not later
than 15 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
Notification of Funding Availability.—The Department is di-
rected to notify the Committee not later than three business days
prior to any announcement of funding availability, including fund-
ing opportunity announcements and solicitations. In addition, the
Department is directed to notify the Committee not later than
three business days prior to any issuance of a letter to terminate
funding.
Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE).—The
Committee directs the ORISE program to incorporate technical
trades that are key to supporting cutting-edge research and devel-
opment programs in addition to the traditional research partici-
pants. Efforts should also be made to document the performance of
the STEM and technical workforce and focus on further improving
the efficiency and effectiveness of the talent pool for the stream-
lined federal workforce.
Office of Critical and Emerging Technologies.—The purpose of
the Office of Critical and Emerging Technologies is to coordinate ef-
forts for research, development, and other activities regarding arti-
ficial intelligence, machine learning, quantum information science
and technology, microelectronics, semiconductors, and other tech-
nologies within the Department. The Committee recognizes the
value of this role and supports efforts to formulate a coherent vi-
sion and strategy on these technologies. However, the Committee
believes a more effective approach is to perform these coordinating
functions within the office of the Undersecretary for Science and
Innovation.
State Policies on Energy Reliability and Resiliency.—The Com-
mittee supports recent executive actions that seeks to foster Amer-
ican energy dominance and strengthen the production, trans-
mission, and distribution of energy. The Committee is concerned
that state policies which limit production, transmission, and dis-
tribution of energy, such as premature retirements of electric gen-
erating capacity and additional regulations on natural gas produc-
tion may be having a negative effect on national energy reliability
and resiliency. The Committee directs the Department to provide
not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act a re-
port that provides an overview of the aforementioned policies at a
state level to gain a better understanding of national energy reli-
ability and resiliency.
Improving Life-Cycle Models.—The Committee directs the De-
partment to improve and refine the Alternative Fuel Life-Cycle En-
vironmental and Economic Transportation (AFLEET) computa-
tional modeling tool and the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emis-
sions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) life cycle assess-
ment model. The Committee recommends that the background

database for the AFLEET tool and GREET model utilize propane
emissions data available from the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy.
FOREIGN ENTITIES OF CONCERN
The Committee recognizes the potential threat of foreign entities
of concern to U.S. research security, economic competitiveness, and
energy security. The CHIPS and Science Act (Public Law 117–167)
established some research security requirements and procedures to
enhance protection of federal investments in advanced technologies.
The fiscal year 2024 Act built on those provisions by establishing
additional restrictions to ensure U.S. assets, particularly energy re-
serves and federal taxpayer dollars, are not passed to foreign enti-
ties of concern. This recommendation continues and builds upon
those provisions.
The Committee is concerned by the potential for advanced tech-
nologies to be used by foreign entities of concern to exploit data
and threaten economic security. In particular, the Committee notes
the reliance on other renewable energy technologies produced out-
side the United States and the use of artificial intelligence in nu-
merous energy technologies. The Department shall focus efforts, to
the greatest extent possible, on supporting and protecting tech-
nology and intellectual property created in the United States.
Further, the Committee directs the Department to provide not
later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act a report
on the capabilities of AI solutions and their integration into U.S.
energy infrastructure. The report shall emphasize (1) the risks
posed by foreign countries of concern leveraging AI as attack vec-
tors and potential mitigations and (2) how the Department can im-
plement risk management measures and partner with other de-
partments and agencies to prevent such entities from operating on
federal lands.
The Committee remains concerned that America’s dependence on
foreign entities of concern for neodymium iron boron magnets poses
significant risks to military readiness and economic competitive-
ness. The Committee directs the Department to produce a study
within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on U.S. or allied
countries’ abilities to solely produce neodymium iron boron magnet
manufacturing equipment without reliance on foreign entities of
concern.
The recommendation includes additional requirements within the
direction provided for various specific Department of Energy (DOE)
programs.
MULTI-PROGRAM DIRECTIVES
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.—The
Committee notes that the fiscal year 2023 Act directed the Depart-
ment to provide a briefing on its efforts to offer technical and other
programmatic assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico re-
garding the implementation of innovative energy technologies. The
Committee still awaits this brief.
Distribution Transformers.—The Committee notes the unique
challenges facing the distribution transformer supply chain. A sta-
ble supply of distribution transformers is critical to preserving the
reliability of the grid. The Department is encouraged to conduct ac-

92
tivities that will expand domestic manufacturing capacity within
the distribution transformer supply chain, including efforts to in-
crease the energy efficiency of the manufacturing process. In addi-
tion, the Committee directs the Department to continue its efforts
to engage with utilities, distribution transformer manufacturers,
and other industry stakeholders in the supply chain to analyze and
help identify potential solutions that can help ease the supply-de-
mand mismatch.
Energy-Water Nexus.—The Committee supports the Department’s
ongoing efforts, including through the Water Security Grand Chal-
lenge, on advancing transformational technology and innovation to
meet the global need for safe, secure, and affordable energy and
water. The Committee recognizes the impact of water security and
availability on energy production and reliability and the growing
interconnectedness between energy and water systems. The De-
partment is directed to continue programs that provide basic re-
search, technology innovation, modeling and assessment tools, tech-
nical support, planning tools to inform financing, and workforce de-
velopment to focus on the energy-water nexus. The Committee sup-
ports the Department’s use of a diverse portfolio of prizes; competi-
tions; research, development, and demonstration; and other pro-
grams, including interagency coordination through the nexus of en-
ergy and water sustainability.
Hybrid Nuclear-Geothermal Systems.—The Department is di-
rected to provide to the Committee not later than 180 days after
the date of enactment of this Act a briefing outlining a strategic
plan to establish a research and development program on hybrid
nuclear-geothermal systems. The briefing shall focus on technology
development needed to pair nuclear fission generated waste heat
with low-grade geothermal resources for direct use heating, power
generation, and reservoir thermal energy storage.
Hydrogen Research Coordination.—The Department is directed to
coordinate its efforts in hydrogen energy and fuel cell technologies
across Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy,
Nuclear Energy, Electricity, Science, Advanced Research Projects
Agency—Energy, and any other relevant program offices to maxi-
mize the effectiveness of investments in hydrogen-related activities.
ENERGY PROGRAMS
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY
The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)
program is divided into three portfolios: sustainable transportation,
renewable energy, and energy efficiency. The sustainable transpor-
tation portfolio, which consists of the vehicles, bioenergy, and hy-
drogen and fuel cell programs, focuses on efforts to enable greater
vehicle efficiency and electrification, commercially viable hydrogen
fuel cell trucks, sustainable aviation fuel from biomass, and lower-
pollution options for off-road vehicles, rail, and maritime transport.

93
programs, develops cost-effective solutions to reduce energy con-
sumption in plants, buildings, and homes.
The Committee recommends $1,830,000,000 for EERE. In sup-
port of the budget request, the Committee has prioritized research
and development on geothermal activities within EERE. The Com-
mittee notes the broad scope of technologies funded by EERE and
has made strategic investments to ensure taxpayer resources sup-
port an approach that highlights earlier stage research and devel-
opment activities that will lead to lower energy costs for Americans
and advance future technological innovations.
Energy Technology Innovation (ETI).—The Committee supports
funding for the ETI initiative, formerly known as the Energy Tran-
sitions Initiative, including the Technology-to-Market and Commu-
nities subprogram, to support the ETI Partnership Project (ETIPP)
to address high energy costs, reliability, and inadequate infrastruc-
ture challenges faced by island and remote communities with iso-
lated power systems, particularly small communities located at the
edge of the grid or at the end of fuel distribution systems.
Interconnection Innovation Database.—The Committee is con-
cerned about interconnection backlogs for energy generation and
storage and directs the Department’s Interconnection Innovation
eXchange to prioritize the completion of publicly accessible datasets
with harmonized data fields to provide digitized, online, verifiable
information for hosting capacity and queue data for both distribu-
tion and transmission, expand data sharing, and to develop flexible
interconnection solutions. The Department is directed to provide
not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act a
briefing on its efforts to update eXchange.
Lab Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP).—The Com-
mittee supports LEEP and its efforts to support more entrepre-
neurial fellows in a broader range of energy technology innova-
tions, expand networking and ecosystem support, and seek ways to
centralize the coordination of the four LEEP nodes by a single enti-
ty.
Workforce Development.—The Committee supports training and
workforce development programs that assist and support workers
in trades and activities required for the continued growth of the
U.S. energy sector, including training programs focused on building
retrofits, the construction industry, and the electric vehicle indus-
try. The Department is encouraged to continue to work with two-
year community and technical colleges; labor; and nongovern-
mental and industry consortia to pursue job training programs, in-
cluding programs focused on displaced fossil fuel workers, that lead
to an industry-recognized credential in the energy workforce. In ad-
dition, the Committee supports the use of emerging technologies,
including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and digital twins
for improved decision support and analysis when assessing future
workforce needs and trends.
SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION
The recommendation provides up to $35,000,000 to continue the
SuperTruck program in support of the electrification of medium-
and heavy-duty vehicles, including Class-8 long haul trucks, and
associated charging infrastructure. In addition, the Committee en-

courages the SuperTruck program to focus on improving charging
infrastructure, fleet connectivity, and battery health monitoring.
Vehicle Technologies.—The recommendation provides not less
than $90,000,000 for Battery and Electrification Technologies, in-
cluding for electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling technology.
The recommendation provides up to $5,000,000 to work on stand-
ardized vehicle integration for powertrain controls.
The recommendation supports continued work on zero emission
fuels for off-road applications, including applications in ports, ware-
houses, and railyards.
The Committee supports efforts to advance competitive solicita-
tions to develop advanced automotive materials for domestic manu-
facturing.
The Committee includes $5,000,000 to develop a low-cost, scal-
able battery system for non-plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that can

frames as appropriate, to guide efforts to develop solutions and
support for addressing transformer supply chain challenges and to
increase support for utilities and facilitate greater participation in
industry sharing efforts. In addition, the Committee directs the De-
partment to continue its efforts to engage with utilities, distribu-
tion transformer manufacturers, and other industry stakeholders in
the supply chain to analyze and help identify potential solutions
that can help ease the supply-demand mismatch.
Within available funds, the Committee directs the Department to
support research and development efforts that validate new ther-
mal management system applications that improve operational effi-
ciency, decrease system failure, and increase end of life
recyclability for end use applications such as data centers, grid
hardware, and power delivery systems.
The Committee directs the Department to coordinate with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, relevant national labora-
tories, universities, relevant electric regulatory authorities, and
other stakeholders to evaluate the technical and operational poten-
tial for demand response and load flexibility from large, energy-in-
tensive facilities such as data centers. This analysis should assess
the impacts of such energy-intensive loads under various energy
mix scenarios; current barriers to participation in demand response
and load flexibility programs; the potential grid and ratepayer ben-
efits of flexibility programs, including reliability and affordability;
and the role of interconnection procedures in enabling flexible load
integration. The Department is directed to provide a briefing not
later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on its
efforts.

NUCLEAR ENERGY
A productive energy sector contains a mix of energy types includ-
ing nuclear energy. Nuclear power generates approximately one-
fifth of the Nation’s electricity and continues to be an important
emissions-free energy source. The Department’s Nuclear Energy
program invests in research, development, and demonstration ac-
tivities that develop the next generation of clean and safe reactors,
further improve the safety and economic viability of the current re-
actor fleet, and contribute to the Nation’s long-term leadership in
the global nuclear power industry.

kind advanced nuclear technologies for commercial deployment.
Rather than cede leadership in nuclear energy to countries such as
China and Russia, the Committee advances efforts to demonstrate
new nuclear reactor technologies. The recommendation repurposes
funding to accelerate ongoing nuclear demonstration activities, in-
cluding not less than one small modular reactor deployment, the
two demonstration projects under the Advanced Reactor Dem-
onstration Program, and Risk Reduction projects for future dem-
onstrations.
Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP).—Since 2009, the
Department has allocated up to 20 percent of funds appropriated
to Nuclear Energy research and development programs to fund uni-
versity-led R&D and university infrastructure projects through an
open, competitive solicitation process using formally certified peer
reviewers. The recommendation continues to include a separate
control point to fund NEUP and other crosscutting program respon-
sibilities, including Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR),
Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and Technology Com-
mercialization Fund (TCF), in order to provide greater trans-
parency and flexibility for this program. Prior to the obligation of
these funds, the Department is directed to provide to the Com-
mittee a detailed execution plan for NEUP activities. The Depart-
ment is directed to provide to the Committee not later than 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter up-
dates on the implementation of NEUP. As in previous years, no
funds are provided for the planning and construction of new uni-
versity reactors.
Within available funds for NEUP, SBIR/STTR, and TCF, the
Committee recommends $6,500,000 for the University Nuclear
Leadership Program. The Committee notes the importance of this
program in developing highly qualified nuclear specialists to meet
national needs. Further, the Committee notes its support for the di-
versification of financial assistance it provides through the program
to include supporting nontechnical nuclear research that serves to
increase community participation and confidence in nuclear energy
systems.
The Committee recognizes the importance of the U.S. university
nuclear research infrastructure to support continued nuclear indus-
try innovations and workforce training and development and is
aware of the gaps in existing domestic research reactor capabilities.
The Committee encourages the Department to evaluate the current
landscape of U.S. research and test reactors and the need for addi-
tional research and training capabilities, including any federal sup-
port necessary to achieve such capabilities.
The Committee supports the Department’s initiative to seek ap-
plications for innovative artificial intelligence and machine learn-
ing solutions that can accelerate nuclear energy technology design,
licensing, deployment, operation, and maintenance. The Depart-
ment is encouraged to leverage artificial intelligence and digital
twin technology to advance small modular reactor (SMR) integra-
tion to support power demands of data centers.

mittee supports efforts to develop artificial intelligence tools to ex-
pedite the development and deployment of advanced nuclear energy
systems.
FUEL CYCLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability.—The recommendation in-
cludes $28,500,000 for EBR–II processing for High-Assay Low-En-
riched Uranium (HALEU).
The Committee emphasizes the urgent need for commercially
available HALEU to enable U.S. leadership in the deployment of
advanced reactor technologies. The Committee expects the Depart-
ment to accelerate the availability of new and diverse domestic ura-
nium enrichment capacity. The Department is urged to expedi-
tiously down-select eligible offerors and establish firm offtake
agreements that support the development of commercially-competi-
tive HALEU capacity in the United States, and to implement per-
formance-based milestones that ensure progress and reduce uncer-
tainty in timing and delivery of HALEU.
The Committee is pleased that the Department has taken steps
to begin to allocate HALEU material from DOE sources to address
the near-term fuel needs of nuclear developers. As the Department
proceeds with future HALEU allocations, the Committee urges the
Department to prioritize HALEU to advanced reactor projects that
can demonstrate, through a defined vetting process examining the
project’s technological, licensing, financial, and commercial matu-
rity, that they are nearest to active testing, demonstration, and
commercialization, and therefore have the most immediate need,
regardless of awardee tier, pathway, or other categorical factors.
The Committee is aware of non-federal efforts to deploy advanced
research reactors at certain U.S. universities. Some of these reac-
tors may require advanced fuel types, including the potential use
of HALEU and molten salt from existing DOE inventories. When
prioritizing use of these inventories and funding for nuclear fuel,
the Department shall consider the benefits of advanced university
research reactors and the financial impact of significant private in-
vestment.
The Department is encouraged to consider innovative nuclear en-
richment technologies, including commercialization activities asso-
ciated with laser enrichment technology, and novel separation and
enrichment methods in furtherance of expanding the U.S. supply of
HALEU.
Material Recovery and Waste Form Development.—The United
States has approximately 95,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel
from commercial reactors stored at 75 U.S. sites, as well as spent
nuclear fuel from defense and other research reactors. Currently,
countries including France, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, and
China reprocess their nuclear waste. The Committee applauds the
Administration’s focus on recycling and reprocessing spent nuclear
fuel and supports efforts to accelerate the Department’s ongoing re-
processing work in order to bring these capabilities to the United
States.
The Committee recommends not less than $10,000,000 to con-
tinue the Department’s competitive, cost-shared program for re-
processing spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors, and not
less than $10,000,000 for a competitive, cost-shared, industry-led

program for reprocessing naval spent nuclear fuel or other avail-
able highly enriched uranium from within the Department’s inven-
tory. Award funding may be used for (1) conceptual design; (2)
technical studies; and (3) site studies. The primary goal of these
programs is to focus government and industry resources on reproc-
essing capabilities with commercial application by 2033. These pro-
grams are not intended to stop or supplant any other ongoing ac-
tivities or programs.
The Committee supports the development of capabilities to proc-
ess Advanced Test Reactor spent fuel for additional HALEU and
valuable recyclable components recovery and re-use. The Depart-
ment is encouraged to consider a competitive, cost-shared program
for early-state, industry-led technology development related to tech-
nology demonstration of aqueous recycling and recovery of critical
isotopes for use in medicine, industry, or defense.
Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATF).—The Committee continues to
place a high priority on completion of the near-term ATF program
and urges the Department to maintain focus on achieving near-
term results under development by the three industry-led vendors
in these efforts. The recommendation supports the participation of
the three industry-led teams in the cost-shared research and devel-
opment program and for testing, code development, and licensing
of higher-enriched and higher burnup accident tolerant fuels. The
Department is reminded that it cannot reallocate or reprogram
funds without the approval of the Committee. The Department is
directed to align its contracts with the three industry-led teams
with the funding provided by the Committee. Finally, the Depart-
ment is directed to provide the Committee not later than 60 days
after the date of enactment of this Act a table summarizing the al-
location of funds.
Next Generation Fuels.—The recommendation provides not less
than $40,000,000 for further development of silicon carbide ceramic
matrix composite fuel cladding for light water reactors, not less
than $17,000,000 to continue TRISO fuel qualification activities,
and not less than $18,000,000 for advanced metallic fuels activities.
The Committee is pleased with the results so far from the devel-
opment of the silicon carbide ceramic matrix fuel rod development
and urges the Department to address domestic fabrication develop-
ment aimed at effecting scale-up to 12-foot silicon carbide cladding,
along with the necessary irradiation and post-irradiation examina-
tion, associated licensing activities, and modeling tools that will
validate its performance.
Used Nuclear Fuels Disposition R&D.—The Committee supports
the Department’s efforts to launch a Spent Nuclear Fuel Center for
Applied Research in Storage and Transportation to collaborate with
the nuclear industry to address challenges related to long-term
storage of spent nuclear fuel, conduct research that supports near-
term regulatory compliance, and ensure public confidence for stor-
age and transportation of commercial and DOE-managed spent nu-
clear fuel and high-level waste.
The Department is encouraged to demonstrate the safe transpor-
tation of spent nuclear fuel in large dual-purpose storage and
transportation containers.

survey electric transmission and distribution system operators for
data on new generator interconnection applications and to provide
to the Committee not later than 180 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act a report that summarizes its efforts.
The Committee recognizes the dramatic load growth on the elec-
tric grid over the next decade, in part due to the commercial com-
putation sector. As such, the EIA is encouraged to collect data on
aggregate state-level, monthly computation sector electricity de-
mand. The EIA is encouraged to publish this data alongside its
other data on electricity consumption by customer segment (resi-
dential, commercial, industrial) monthly, at state-level granularity.

Paducah Site.—The Committee is supportive of the Department’s
determination to build a new program support facility as the most
cost-effective option to provide modern workspace at the Paducah
Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP). As maintenance costs regularly
exceed $1,000,000 annually for the legacy 70-year-old C–100 pro-
gram support facility, constructing new office space is the most
prudent option for supporting the site’s 400 employees for the dura-
tion of cleanup efforts with the additional benefit of transferring
the facility to the local community upon project completion.
SCIENCE
The Office of Science funds science research across national lab-
oratories, universities, and other research institutions in support of
American innovation and the Department’s energy-focused mis-
sions. Through research in physics, biology, chemistry, and other
science disciplines, these activities expand scientific understanding
and secure the Nation’s leadership in energy innovation. This
science research is crucial to enabling the Nation to continue devel-
oping transformational energy technologies and to position itself to
seize economic opportunities in the global energy markets of the fu-
ture. The Office of Science is the Nation’s largest supporter of re-
search in the physical sciences. The Committee has placed a high
priority on funding these activities, given the private sector is not
likely to fund research whose findings either have high non-com-
mercial value or are not likely to be commercialized in the near or
medium term. This work is vital to sustaining the scientific leader-
ship of the United States and can provide the underpinnings for
valuable intellectual property in the coming decades.

backs of various funding models, including the impact on the Of-
fice’s ability to address security concerns in a comprehensive and
proactive manner.
Puerto Rico Power Generation Assets.—The Committee acknowl-
edges that Puerto Rico has faced various natural disasters and eco-
nomic challenges that have resulted in disruptions in services, such
as a reliable and continuous power supply. Additionally, the gen-
eration assets on the island are outdated, with some being at least
60 years old, which makes repairs even more complex. It is impera-
tive to provide Puerto Rico with power solutions that can be in-
stalled and maintained quickly while the necessary repairs and
maintenance are carried out on publicly owned power plants and,
in parallel, new clean power resources are procured. The Secretary
shall provide to the Committee not later than 30 days after the

laborating with other heads of federal agencies, including the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, Chief of Engineers of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, and the Government of Puerto Rico on identi-
fying increased support for energy generation on the island.
Cybersecurity in DOE Contracts.—The Committee is concerned
that the standard DOE and NNSA procurement scoring process is
insufficient for strong cybersecurity operations. The current process
discourages the measurement, performance, and adoption of inno-
vative, emerging, and secure cybersecurity and IT hardware/soft-
ware, including artificial intelligence, data analytics, and data
management. To enhance industries’ ability to deliver proven, cost-
effective cybersecurity capabilities to DOE Site Management & Op-
erations, NNSA and DOE must broaden proposal evaluation cri-
teria to address cybersecurity, life-cycle IT requirements, and the
ability to adopt future technologies.
OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

viding militarily effective nuclear propulsion plants to the U.S.
Navy.
WEAPONS ACTIVITIES
Weapons Activities supports the Nation’s current and future nu-
clear deterrence posture and the necessary infrastructure of
science, technology, engineering, and production capabilities with-
out resuming underground nuclear explosive testing. These activi-
ties are funded by five main elements: Stockpile Management; Pro-
duction Modernization; Stockpile Research, Technology, and Engi-
neering; Infrastructure and Operations; and Security functions.
NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs leads technology transfer
and commercialization activities at NNSA national laboratories.
Enhancing NNSA’s technology transfer and commercialization ac-
tivities supports the research, development, and deployment of
groundbreaking technologies. NNSA is encouraged to invest addi-
tional resources and efforts into technology transfer programs.
The Committee recommends $20,661,993,000 for Weapons Activi-
ties.
New Starts.—The recommendation provides no funding for new
starts.
STOCKPILE MANAGEMENT
Stockpile Management includes all activities that directly sustain
and modernize the nuclear stockpile. These activities include main-
tenance, operations, surveillance, dismantlement, and weapon ac-
quisition programs including life extensions, modifications, and al-
terations.
Stockpile Major Modernization.—The Stockpile Major Moderniza-
tion program extends the lifetime of the Nation’s nuclear stockpile
while addressing required updates, replacing aging or obsolete com-
ponents to ensure continued service life, as well as enhancing secu-
rity and safety features. This program funds warhead acquisition
programs necessary to extend the expected life of stockpile systems
for an additional 20 to 30 years. The Committee recommends full
funding for all ongoing life extension programs and major alter-
ations.
Stockpile Sustainment.—The Stockpile Sustainment program di-
rectly executes maintenance, surveillance, assessment, surety, and
management activities for all enduring weapons systems in the

of lithium processing and production of lithium components given
severe concrete degradation in Building 9204–2. Replacing Building
9204–2 with the new LPF will improve employee safety, enable the
development of new and improved processes, increase capacity, and
greatly reduce operational and maintenance costs. Maintaining
processing of this strategic material within a single modern facility
at Y–12 is critical to minimizing risk and proper stewardship of
Lithium-6, of which the Nation has a fixed stockpile and no current
means of producing. NNSA is directed to provide the Committee
not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act a
briefing on the status of the LPF project to include opportunities
to expedite construction as well as the required investments to ex-
tend operations in Building 9204–2 until project completion.
Plutonium Pit Production.—The Committee continues to support
the two-site program of record to reestablish the Nation’s capability
to produce 80 plutonium pits per year as close to 2030 as possible.
The infrastructure and critical skills required for pit production
and other plutonium capabilities are essential for a secure and reli-
able nuclear deterrent. The need is even more acute given the cur-
rent geopolitical environment. The Committee recommends full
funding for the Savannah River Site plutonium activities and plu-
tonium modernization at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Tritium Processing.—The nuclear deterrent relies on an efficient
and reliable system to process tritium in quantities that meet cur-
rent and future stockpile stewardship requirements. These require-
ments are currently met using processes, technologies, and facili-
ties that are multiple decades old, aging rapidly, and have tech-
nical shortcomings. NNSA is directed to provide to the Committee
not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act a
report on its plan to develop, test, and validate in a relevant envi-
ronment new surveillance and processing technologies associated
with tritium operations that are cost effective and provide greater
efficiency, reliability, and increased capacity through continuous
operations. The plan shall also include the specifics regarding the
necessary research, development, and demonstration facilities and
infrastructure needed to execute the plan. The Committee rec-
ommends full funding for the Tritium and Defense Fuels program.
University Collaboration.—The Committee continues to support
the goals and outputs of the Center of Excellence in lifetime exten-
sion research and materials science and encourages the parties to
incorporate artificial intelligence and data analytics capabilities
into the Center’s research and training elements to maximize appli-
cations for the Stockpile Stewardship Mission.
Uranium Processing.—The Committee recommends $730,000,000
for the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) at Y–12.
STOCKPILE RESEARCH, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENGINEERING

ment and its Exascale Computing Initiative for helping the Nation
stay at the forefront of supercomputing technologies which enabled
the deployment of El Capitan at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. El Capitan is AI-enabled and will be the first exascale
class system focused on the national security mission. The Com-
mittee encourages the Department to build on this model of success
with a new multi-year program, leveraging public-private partner-
ships, to co-design and co-develop leading edge artificial intel-
ligence and post-exascale advanced computing technologies vital for
national defense.
Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and High Yield.—The Com-
mittee recommends $699,206,000 for the ICF and High-Yield Cam-
paign, including target research, development, and fabrication.
Stockpile Responsiveness Program (SRP).—The recommendation
includes $27,500,000 for the Integrated Demonstrator Program to
continue the SRP-derived low-cost modular family of sub-orbital ve-
hicles to enhance nuclear modernization testing efforts. NNSA is
encouraged to adopt a qualification testing program using the mod-
ular boost system approach to reduce risk and cost to the U.S. Air
Force Sentinel program.
ACADEMIC PROGRAMS
Academic Programs.—The Committee recognizes the importance
of Academic Programs in supporting the nuclear security enterprise
in both research and development and the development of a highly
skilled workforce. Within Academic Programs, $25,000,000 is for
the Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program, and
$5,000,000 is for Tribal Colleges and Universities.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS
Infrastructure and Operations provides funding for the base op-
erations, maintenance, and recapitalization of NNSA’s facilities and
infrastructure.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Site 300.—As LLNL
continues to support National Security missions, the Committee en-
courages NNSA to continue coordination with the Laboratory to
provide additional classified office space at Site 300.
Munitions and Unexploded Ordnances.—The Committee notes
the continued discovery of munitions debris in and around Native
lands from weapons-related testing performed for DoD missions.
Removal of this potentially harmful weapons-related material be-
fore it is inadvertently found by the civilian population is impor-
tant. Consistent with existing authorities and responsibilities,
NNSA and the Department are encouraged to continue working
with DoD to proactively consult with affected Tribal Nations and
Native communities; locate unknown munitions through surveying
affected Native lands and remove debris, munitions, or unexploded
ordnances; and to use modern technologies where possible in sur-
veys of affected Native lands. The Committee encourages NNSA
and the Department to support DoD’s efforts through review and
sharing of records of weapons testing-related activities with DoD,
affected Tribal Nations, and Native communities, including the

and implements NNSA’s security program, enabling its NSE mis-
sions. The DNS protects NNSA personnel, facilities, nuclear weap-
ons, and special nuclear materials from a full spectrum of threats.
Counter Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (CUAS).—The Committee re-
mains supportive of NNSA’s innovative approach to leverage com-
mercially available software and hardware technology to detect
ground and aerial intrusions and advanced defeat capabilities. The
Committee is supportive of NNSA’s efforts to transition its success-
ful pilot to a family of systems program of record at additional sites
across the complex as part of the Future Years Nuclear Security
Program. No later than 180 days after the date of enactment of
this Act, NNSA shall provide a briefing on CUAS capabilities, to
include the resources and timeline necessary to acquire next-gen-
eration CUAS platforms to protect the NSE from evolving UAS
threats.
Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS).—The Committee
encourages NNSA to expedite the acquisition and implementation
of WIDS to protect NSE sites from unauthorized devices and radio
frequency transmissions.

States while refocusing the Global Material Security program on
the activities that have the greatest impact on national security.
Additionally, reductions to Nonproliferation and Arms Control are
a reflection of a changing geopolitical landscape marked by rapid
growth of China’s nuclear arsenal and Russia’s frequent violation
of arms control agreements. With uncooperative leadership in
China and Russia, the prospect of a new nuclear arms control trea-
ty is improbable, particularly with expiration of the Measures for
the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms,
also known as the New START Treaty, in 2026.
Nonproliferation Stewardship Program (NSP).—The rec-
ommendation includes $149,383,000 for NSP to address immediate
capability shortfalls in nonproliferation missions, especially in ura-
nium enrichment, uranium conversion, weaponization, and pluto-
nium sciences.
The Committee continues to support the Nuclear Smuggling De-
tection and Deterrence (NSDD) program’s efforts to deploy modern
and ruggedized equipment to detect and identify nuclear threats.
Partner nation sustainment of such equipment is vital, therefore
the Committee urges the NSDD program to provide partner na-
tions with detection equipment that is more easily sustainable to
reduce program costs.
NUCLEAR COUNTERTERRORISM AND INCIDENT RESPONSE
NNSA’s Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response pro-
grams respond to and mitigate nuclear and radiological incidents
worldwide to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism.
LEGACY CONTRACTOR PENSIONS
The Committee provides $20,993,000 for payments, required by
legal obligations, into the legacy University of California contractor
employee defined benefit pension plans, the Requa settlement
reached in 2019, and the pension plan at the Savannah River Site.
NAVAL REACTORS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The Naval Reactors program is responsible for all aspects of
naval nuclear propulsion from technology development through re-
actor operations to ultimate reactor plant disposal. The program
provides for the design, development, testing, and evaluation of im-
proved naval nuclear propulsion plants and reactor cores.
The Committee recommends $2,171,023,000 for Naval Reactors.
Infrastructure Project Management.—The Committee remains
concerned with Naval Reactor’s ability to manage large-scale infra-
structure recapitalization projects such as the Naval Spent Fuel
Handling Project (SFHP) given significant cost increases and
schedule delays. While project complications due to COVID–19 and
workforce shortages in the region are reasonable contributing fac-
tors to the project’s challenges, the Committee remains concerned
with Naval Reactors’ construction project management expertise
particularly given commencement of the Naval Examination and
Assessment Project. The Committee reiterates the importance of
independent cost estimates, as noted in GAO report GAO–25–
106997. While Naval Reactors has completed a root cause analysis

of SFHP cost increases and quality issues, the review was not con-
ducted by staff independent to the project. The Committee encour-
ages Naval Reactors to oversee the NEAP with more objective and
reliable information in order to prevent project cost increases and
delays.
FEDERAL SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The Federal Salaries and Expenses account provides salaries,
corporate planning, oversight, and management for Defense Pro-
grams, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and the NNSA field of-
fices in New Mexico, Nevada, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, South
Carolina, and California.
The Committee recommends $500,000,000 for Federal Salaries
and Expenses.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER DEFENSE ACTIVITIES
DEFENSE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP
The Defense Environmental Cleanup account provides funding
for identifying and reducing risks and managing waste at sites
where the Nation carried out defense-related nuclear research and
production activities that resulted in radioactive, hazardous, and
mixed waste contamination requiring remediation, stabilization, or
other cleanup action.
The Committee recommends $6,521,396,000 for Defense Environ-
mental Cleanup.

portance of completing the Idaho CERCLA Disposal Facility not
later than August 2026 to support ongoing decommissioning activi-
ties in support of Naval Reactors and the Idaho Cleanup Project.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.—The Committee is
aware of the progress made to date in the remediation of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory Site 300. The Department is en-
couraged to continue cooperation between the Office of Environ-
mental Management and NNSA and work with state regulators to
continue progress on remaining remediation work.
Savannah River Site.—The fiscal year 2026 budget request ad-
vances the plan that was originally proposed in the fiscal year 2025
budget request to transition oversight of the Savannah River Site
from the Office of Environmental Management to NNSA by trans-
ferring certain work scope and funding. The recommendation pro-
vides funding reflecting these transfers.
Sodium and Lithium Hydride Shields.—The Committee is aware
the Department manages an inventory of 43 radioactive contami-
nated shields used in experiments from 1954 to 1992 at the former
K–25 site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Committee is pleased by
the proactive efforts to identify a disposition path for this chal-
lenging waste stream in 2025 and encourages the Department to
provide sufficient continuous funding to eliminate the Oak Ridge
contaminated shields expeditiously.
Strontium-90 Reuse.—The Committee encourages the Office of
Environmental Management to collaborate with DoD and private
industry to identify opportunities to make Strontium-90 from the
Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility (WESF) at the Hanford

Site available for commercial beneficial reuse. Strontium-90 has po-
tential national security and scientific applications and the transfer
of radioactive capsules from the WESF into dry casks storage rep-
resents an opportunity for access.
Transportation of Transuranic Waste.—Not later than 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Office of Environmental
Management shall provide a briefing on the procurement and in-
ventory management of containers used for the transportation of
contact-handled transuranic waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant.
Program Direction.—The recommendation includes the transfer
of work scope and funding related to Savannah River Site to
NNSA.
Program Support.—The recommendation includes the budget re-
quest for the Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program.
The Department is directed to use a competitive, merit-based proc-
ess in awarding funds for this program. Further, the Department
is directed to provide to the Committee not later than 60 days after
the date of enactment of this Act and prior to the issuance of a
funding opportunity announcement or the allocation or obligation
of any funds a detailed spend plan for fiscal year 2026 funds.
Technology Development.—The Committee supports the Depart-
ment’s efforts to expand technological development and demonstra-
tion to address its long-term and technically complex cleanup chal-
lenges. The Committee recommends $7,000,000 to continue incre-
mental qualification, testing, and research to advance state-of-the-
art containment ventilation systems.
Use of prior year balances.—The recommendation includes the
use of $310,000,000 in prior year balances. The Committee notes
the Office of Environmental Management’s unobligated balance of
$900,000,000. Given resources constraints, the Committee must
make difficult tradeoffs to prioritize the greatest needs in a fiscally
responsible manner. The Committee expects the Department to
continue to make progress on all sites using funds provided in this
and prior year Acts.
OTHER DEFENSE ACTIVITIES
The Other Defense Activities account provides funding for the
Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security; the Office of
Independent Enterprise Assessments; the Office of Legacy Manage-
ment; Specialized Security Activities; Defense Related Administra-
tive Support; and the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
The Committee recommends $1,179,950,000 for Other Defense
Activities.
POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS
Management of the federal power marketing functions was trans-
ferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of
Energy in the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977
(Public Law 95–91). These functions include the power marketing
activities authorized under section 5 of the Flood Control Act of
1944 and all other functions of the Bonneville Power Administra-
tion, the Southeastern Power Administration, the Southwestern
Power Administration, and the power marketing functions of the

Bureau of Reclamation that have been transferred to the Western
Area Power Administration.
All four power marketing administrations (PMAs) give preference
in the sale of their power to publicly-owned and cooperatively-
owned utilities. Operations of the Bonneville Power Administration
are financed principally under the authority of the Federal Colum-
bia River Transmission System Act (Public Law 93–454). Under
this Act, the Bonneville Power Administration is authorized to use
its revenues to finance the costs of its operations, maintenance, and
capital construction and to sell bonds to the Treasury if necessary
to finance any additional capital program requirements.
BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION FUND
The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is the Department’s
marketing agency for electric power in the Pacific Northwest. BPA
provides electricity to a 300,000 square mile service area in the Co-
lumbia River drainage basin and it markets the power from federal
hydropower projects in the Northwest, as well as power from non-
federal generating facilities in the region, and exchanges and mar-
kets surplus power with Canada and California.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, SOUTHEASTERN POWER
ADMINISTRATION
The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) markets hydro-
electric power from 22 Corps Projects to 473 customers across 11
states in the southeast. SEPA does not own or operate any trans-
mission facilities, so it contracts to ‘‘wheel’’ its power using the ex-
isting transmission facilities of area utilities.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, SOUTHWESTERN POWER
ADMINISTRATION
The Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) markets hydro-
electric power produced at 24 Corps projects in the six-state area
of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas.
SWPA operates and maintains 1,381 miles of transmission lines,
along with supporting substations and communications sites.
CONSTRUCTION, REHABILITATION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,
WESTERN AREA POWER ADMINISTRATION
The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) is responsible
for marketing the electric power generated by the Bureau of Rec-
lamation, the Corps, and the International Boundary and Water
Commission. WAPA also operates and maintains a system of trans-
mission lines nearly 17,000 miles long. WAPA provides electricity
to 15 western states over a service area of 1.3 million square miles.
FALCON AND AMISTAD OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE FUND
Falcon Dam and Amistad Dam, located in Starr County and Val
Verde County, respectively, are two international water projects lo-
cated on the Rio Grande River between Texas and Mexico. Power
generated by hydroelectric facilities at these two dams is sold to
public utilities through WAPA. The Foreign Relations Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 created the Falcon and

Amistad Operating and Maintenance Fund to defray the costs of
operation, maintenance, rehabilitation, and emergency activities.
The Fund is administered by WAPA for use by the Commissioner
of the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Com-
mission.
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The Committee recommends $520,000,000 for the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). Revenues for FERC are estab-
lished at a rate equal to the budget authority, resulting in a net
appropriation of $0.
The Committee directs FERC to identify, validate, and imple-
ment a national real-time grid monitoring service to monitor grid
malfunctions resulting in poor power quality, safety and reliability.
The Committee encourages FERC to include, either in its next
State of the Markets report or as part of a new annual publication,
a comprehensive review of capacity markets.
The Committee directs the Department to work with FERC to
develop options for incentive-based (including performance-based)
rate treatments for interstate electricity transmission to ensure re-
liability and resilience, reduce the cost of electricity, and align to
state energy mix goals associated with electricity by reducing
transmission congestion.
The Committee directs FERC to provide not later than one year
after the date of enactment of this Act a report assessing lessons
learned from ERCOT’s connect-and-manage paradigm and other
flexible interconnect queue rules and to include a section assessing
the benefits and drawbacks of flexible interconnect queue rules
such as the Energy Resource Interconnection Service.
FERC is directed to provide a briefing to the Committee evalu-
ating current FERC actions that contribute to lower transmission
costs and any additional authorities or tools FERC believes it re-
quires to address transmission costs effectively.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION
The Committee’s detailed funding recommendations for programs
in Title III are contained in the following table.

ties that target resources to help communities and regions that
have been affected by job losses in coal mining, coal power plant
operations, and coal related supply chain industries due to the eco-
nomic downturn of the coal industry. These projects will create and
retain jobs, assist businesses, and prepare thousands of workers
and students with globally competitive skills and opportunities in
the region’s manufacturing, technology, entrepreneurship, agri-
culture, and other emerging sectors.
The recommendation includes not less than $7,500,000 to con-
tinue the program of high-speed broadband deployment in dis-
tressed counties within the Central Appalachian region that have
been most negatively impacted by the downturn in the coal indus-
try.

DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) is a federal-state partner-
ship established by the Delta Regional Authority Act of 2000 (Pub-
lic Law 106–554) that serves a 252-county/parish area in an eight-
state region near the mouth of the Mississippi River. Led by a fed-
eral co-chair and the governors of each participating state, the DRA
is designed to remedy severe and chronic economic distress by
stimulating economic development and fostering partnerships that
will have a positive impact on the region’s economy. The DRA
seeks to help local communities leverage other federal and state
programs that are focused on basic infrastructure development,
transportation improvements, business development, and job train-
ing services. Under federal law, at least 75 percent of appropriated
funds must be invested in distressed counties and parishes, with
50 percent of the funds for transportation and basic infrastructure
improvements.
The Committee recommends $25,274,232 for the DRA.

MINORITY VIEWS
Due to concerns about spending levels, harmful cuts to the clean
energy economy, and partisan policy riders, we are unable to sup-
port the bill as written. We oppose this bill which will raise energy
costs for American households and businesses, hurt our competi-
tiveness, jeopardize our energy independence, and weaken our na-
tional security.
Engineered energy and water systems undergird America’s way
of life. They are not optional, but essential to sustaining life. We
have the opportunity—and the responsibility—through this sub-
committee’s bill to make investments that lower energy costs for
American families, promote America’s energy independence, and
support American manufacturing. Sadly, the Majority’s bill does
not meet our nation’s imperative for the future.
Since taking office, the Trump Administration has stolen re-
sources, appropriated by this committee, for programs and services
across the federal government that help to grow the middle class,
protect the working class, support small businesses, and make sure
billionaires and corporations play by the rules and pay their fair
share.
The cost-of-living crisis is felt by every American family—middle
class families, working families, rural families, seniors and other
vulnerable Americans. But this bill fails to address the cost-of-liv-
ing crisis.
Energy demand is higher than ever and only increasing. Cheap,
reliable energy is the basis of a successful economy. We have to in-
crease energy supply or costs will continue to rise for the American
people—and we will be dependent on importing energy to meet our
goals.
China is investing record levels in energy, but this bill retreats
from U.S. global leadership in the future in the form of a diversi-
fied and clean energy economy.
This bill cuts $1.6 billion, or 47 percent, from the Department of
Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs. This
is a direct attack on the programs that lower energy bills for work-
ing families, create good-paying jobs in our communities, and keep
America competitive. Further, it undermines our nation’s impera-
tive to deliver clean, affordable, and secure energy to the American
people and to ensure our nation leads, not lags, in the global race
toward energy independence in perpetuity, including an abundant
clean energy future.
The bill eliminates funding for the Office of Clean Energy Dem-
onstrations, and it revokes $5.1 billion of Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law resources from the Department of Energy that will cede the
U.S. global lead in hydrogen, direct air capture, battery recycling,
and energy improvements in public schools. All of our constituents
lose when we walk away from clean, affordable, domestically-pro-
duced energy.
We strongly oppose the cuts to vital energy production and con-
servation programs. Shortchanging these advances pushes our na-
tion backwards and raises already high energy prices for con-
sumers.

In other areas, this bill dangerously shortchanges our national
security. The bill slashes $412 million from the Defense Nuclear
Nonproliferation account. This effectively guts our efforts to pre-
vent the spread of nuclear weapons, detect covert nuclear threats,
and uphold arms control agreements that keep us safe. Weakening
these programs at a time of growing global threats is irresponsible
and dangerous, and an abandonment of American values.
Additionally, this bill turns its back on communities still living
with the toxic legacy of America’s atomic past. The bill eliminates
funding for the Corps of Engineers’ Formerly Utilized Sites Reme-
dial Action Program, and it cuts the Department of Energy’s Office
of Environmental Management by $779 million, or 9 percent. This
will delay the cleanup these communities across the nation have
been promised for decades.
Finally, this bill includes numerous controversial poison pill rid-
ers that sadly show the Majority is not interested in real bills that
can gain bipartisan support and become law. The bill allows fire-
arms on Corps of Engineers’ public lands; prohibits the Corps of
Engineers from renaming items that commemorate the Confed-
eracy; prohibits implementation of ‘‘Clean Energy for New Federal
Buildings and Major Renovations of Federal Buildings;’’ prohibits
funds for private consolidated interim storage of commercial spent
nuclear fuel; prohibits funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion
initiatives, training, programs, offices, officers, or policies or any

This bill has been considered during a time of remarkable up-
heaval for the Committee. Since taking office in January 2025, the
executive branch has been engaged in a rampant, unlawful, and
unconstitutional disregard for spending laws. In particular, the Of-
fice of Management and Budget has been at the center of a govern-
ment-wide effort to thwart the intent of this Committee’s laws in
its actions, while also unlawfully refusing to publish the agency’s
legally-binding budget decisions (known as apportionments) in con-
travention of an unambiguous and constitutionally sound assertion
of the Congress’s authority to impose transparency requirements
upon the executive branch.
The current executive branch has contended—at times—an in-
herent Presidential power to impound. However, while this bill was
approved over the objection of all Democrats on the Committee, the
debate and proceedings made unmistakably clear, just as former
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States William
Rehnquist concluded (at the time an Assistant Attorney General
with the Department of Justice Office):
‘‘With respect to the suggestion that the President has
a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated
funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad
power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.’’

The laws considered and enacted by this Committee reflect the
legally binding expression of Congress’s constitutional power of the
purse, effectuated through the conditions and permissions the Com-
mittee places on spending authority through the Congress’s Article
I powers. Just as the Committee chooses to allow or restrict the
purpose for any funding in the bill, so too does the Committee de-
cide the amount for which an activity shall be funded. When the
Committee allows the flexibility of merely mandating a ceiling (or
upper limit) or a floor (lowest required level) for an activity, it does
so in contrast to every other instance where it has included a spe-
cific amount, which unless otherwise stated is Congress’s clear in-
tent to be both a floor and a ceiling.
These perspectives are both uncontroversial and longstanding
principles on which all of the Committee’s work rests.
In closing, we oppose this bill. America can—and must—meet the
new age frontiers of energy and water. We owe it to the future. We
stand ready to pass legislation that lowers energy costs for the
American people and ensures America leads the global transition
to a clean energy economy. We must come together—Democrats
and Republicans—to move forward a credible Energy and Water
bill to advance our shared priorities into law.
