PROMOTING RESILIENT SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2025
APRIL28, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 257]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 257) to improve the resilience of crit-
ical supply chains, and for other purposes, having considered the
same, reports favorably thereon with amendments and rec-
ommends that the bill, as amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 257, Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of
2025, is to clarify responsibilities for the Assistant Secretary of
Commerce for Industry and Analysis, including leading an inter-
agency Supply Chain Resilience Working Group (Working Group)
to study and assess American manufacturing and the supply chains
that support critical goods, and providing strategies to mitigate
supply chain shocks.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
While policymakers in the 2010s began raising concerns around
maintaining the United States’ economic competitive edge, espe-
cially through innovation in advanced manufacturing technologies,
the COVID–19 pandemic laid bare that U.S. domestic manufac-
turing faces several challenges, including heavy reliance on frag-
mented global supply chains, labor shortages, high production
costs, and outdated infrastructure. Congress has acknowledged this
reliance represents an economic security liability for the country.
Globalization and the drive to provide low-priced goods to Amer-

ican consumers contributed to offshoring beginning in the 1990s,
making the United States vulnerable to disruptions from events
like pandemics or geopolitical tensions.
The industry also currently struggles with skill gaps, especially
in advanced technologies, and faces competition from lower-cost for-
eign producers. Issues like raw material shortages and regulatory
burdens further complicate efforts to build resilient, flexible supply
chains. In the wake of the 2020 pandemic, Congress has worked to
identify appropriate ways for the Federal Government to
incentivize reshoring of manufacturing back to the United States
and provide better awareness of and transparency for the mate-
rials, services, and processes that impact the critical supply chains
for important goods.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 257 would do the following:
• Clarify the responsibilities of the Department of Commerce’s
Industry and Analysis division;
• Create a dedicated interagency working group to monitor and
assess critical supply chains; and
• Require reports to identify gaps and vulnerabilities, including
ways to reduce dependency on non-allied countries and to fos-
ter the relocation of manufacturing to the United States or al-
lied nations.
The responsibilities and reporting requirements outlined in the
Act would sunset after 10 years.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 257 was introduced on January 27, 2025, by Senator Cantwell
(for herself and Senators Blackburn and Blunt Rochester) and was
referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation of the Senate. On February 5, 2025, the Committee met in
open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 257 reported
favorably with amendments. On March 11, 2025, Senator Shaheen
was added as a cosponsor.
118th Congress
S. 4375, the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2024, was
introduced on May 21, 2024, by Senator Cantwell (for herself and
Senator Blackburn) and was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
H.R. 6571, a House companion bill, was introduced on December
4, 2023, by Representative Bucshon (for himself and Representa-
tive Blunt Rochester) and was referred to the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce of the House of Representatives. Eight cospon-
sors were later added. On May 15, 2024, H.R. 6571 passed the
House under suspension of the rules with a recorded vote of 390–
19.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:

S. 257 would require the Department of Commerce to assess and
prepare for disruptions to supply chains for goods that are critical
to national or economic security. The bill would establish an inter-
agency working group to identify actions that the federal govern-
ment can take to mitigate the economic effects of incidents that
cause gaps in manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, and dis-
tribution networks for those critical goods. The bill also would re-
quire the department to report annually to the Congress on the ef-
fectiveness of its efforts.
Implementing S. 257 would not impose significant new operating
requirements on the Department of Commerce and other federal
agencies because those agencies are already performing most of the
responsibilities that would be required under the bill. CBO esti-
mates that preparing the required assessments and reports would
cost less than $500,000 over the 2025–2030 period. Any spending
would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Aldo Prosperi. The es-
timate was reviewed by Christina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Direc-
tor of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.

turers and assess risks to market stability. The bill would not au-
thorize any new regulations and therefore would not subject any
individuals or businesses to new regulations.
Economic Impact
S. 257, as reported, is not expected to have a negative impact on
the Nation’s economy.
Privacy
S. 257 would require the Working Group to collaborate with Fed-
eral, State, local governments, and international allies to enhance
supply chain resilience, reduce vulnerabilities, and create contin-
gency plans for supply chain shocks. In addition, the bill outlines
protections for voluntarily submitted critical supply chain informa-
tion to the Department of Commerce, ensuring it would remain
confidential and exempt from disclosure laws, except in specific cir-
cumstances, including provisions for information shared in good
faith and limits on its use outside of supply chain resilience efforts.
Paperwork
S. 257 would require the Working Group to oversee the designa-
tion of critical industries, goods, and supply chains, with updates
every 4 years. The report would assess the capacity of critical in-
dustries, identify threats and vulnerabilities, and propose strate-
gies to mitigate risks, especially those related to emerging tech-
nologies. The Assistant Secretary would submit annual reports to
Congress detailing the activities, data, and strategies to strengthen
supply chains, assess risks, and improve the U.S. manufacturing
base and international partnerships.1
