SEC. 2. PRECISION AGRICULTURE SATELLITE CONNECTIVITY.
(a) REVIEW.—The Commission shall—
(1) review the rules of the Commission relating to fixed satellite service, mo-
bile satellite service, and earth exploration satellite service to determine if there
are rule changes that the Commission could implement under existing authority
to promote precision agriculture; and
(2) if the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that there are rule
changes that the Commission could implement, develop recommendations for
how to implement the changes.
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 15 months after the date of the enactment of this Act,
the Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the
House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation of the Senate a report on the results of the review conducted under subsection
(a), including any recommendations developed under paragraph (2) of such sub-
section.
(c) COMMISSIONDEFINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘Commission’’ means the Fed-
eral Communications Commission.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1618, the Precision Agriculture Satellite Connectivity Act,
was introduced by Representative Robert E. Latta (R–OH) on Feb-
ruary 26, 2025. The bill requires the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to review its rules regarding certain satellite
communications services to determine if changes to its rules could
promote precision agriculture. If the FCC determines that there are
rule changes that could be made under the FCC’s existing author-
ity to promote precision agriculture, the FCC must develop rec-
ommendations and submit them to Congress within 15 months of
enactment.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Precision agriculture allows for the optimization of crop yield,
water usage, and soil sustainability. Unfortunately, many rural
communities have little or no connectivity, thereby reducing the
ability of many farmers to utilize precision agriculture. Addition-
ally, there are earth exploration and observation services author-
ized by the FCC that could promote precision agriculture. These
satellite technologies offer the opportunity to expand the use of pre-
cision agriculture throughout the United States, and this legisla-
tion would require the FCC to evaluate its rules to see if there are
changes that can be made to promote this deployment.
COMMITTEE ACTION
The Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing in the
development of the legislation during the 119th Congress. On Jan-
uary 23, 2025, the Subcommittee on Communications and Tech-
nology held a hearing entitled, ‘‘Strengthening American Leader-
ship in Wireless Technology.’’ The Subcommittee received testi-
mony from the following witnesses:
• Mr. Michael K. Powell, President & CEO, NCTA—The
Internet & Television Association;
• Mr. Brad Gillen, Executive Vice President, CTIA—The
Wireless Association;
• Ms. Diane Rinaldo, Executive Director, Open RAN Policy
Coalition; and
• Mr. Chris Lewis, President & CEO, Public Knowledge.
On March 4, 2025, the full Committee on Energy and Commerce
met in open markup session and adopted an amendment in the na-

ture of a substitute by voice vote, and then ordered H.R. 1618, as
amended, favorably reported to the House by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII requires the Committee to list the record
votes on the motion to report legislation and amendments thereto.
There were no record votes taken in connection with order H.R.
1618 reported.
OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Pursuant to clause 2(b)(1) of rule X and clause 3(c)(1) of rule
XIII, the Committee held hearings and made findings that are re-
flected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX
EXPENDITURES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII, the Committee finds that
H.R. 1618 would result in no new or increased budget authority,
entitlement authority, or tax expenditures or revenues.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII, the following is the cost
estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to
section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:
H.R. 1618 would require the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC) to review its rules concerning fixed, mobile, and earth
exploration satellite service and recommend changes that would
promote precision agriculture. The bill would require the FCC to
report to the Congress on that review and any associated rec-
ommendations within 15 months of enactment.
Using information from the FCC, CBO expects that it would need
five part-time employees, at an average cost of $195,000 per person
to review the relevant rules and report to the Congress. On that
basis, CBO estimates that it would cost the agency $1 million over
the 2025–2030 period to implement the bill. However, because the

FCC is authorized to collect fees each year sufficient to offset the
appropriated costs of its regulatory activities, CBO estimates that
the net cost to the FCC would be negligible, assuming appropria-
tion actions consistent with that authority.
If the FCC increased fees to offset the costs associated with im-
plementing the bill, H.R. 1618 would increase the cost of an exist-
ing mandate on private entities required to pay those fees. CBO es-
timates that the incremental cost of that mandate would be small
and fall below the annual threshold established in the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for private-sector mandates ($203
million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
H.R. 1618 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Zunara Naeem (for
federal costs) and Rachel Austin (for mandates). The estimate was
reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the general performance
goal or objective of this legislation is to require the Federal Com-
munications Commission to review its rules regarding certain sat-
ellite communications services to determine whether any changes
could be made to promote precision agriculture, and if so, develop
and submit recommendations to Congress on the rule changes that
could promote precision agriculture.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII, no provision of H.R. 1618
is known to be duplicative of another Federal program, including
any program that was included in a report to Congress pursuant
to section 21 of Public Law 111–139 or the most recent Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance.
RELATED COMMITTEE AND SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII, the following hearings
were used to develop or consider H.R. 1618:
On January 23, 2025, the Subcommittee on Communications and
Technology held a hearing. The title of the hearing was ‘‘Strength-
ening American Leadership in Wireless Technology.’’ The Sub-

Internet & Television Association;
• Mr. Brad Gillen, Executive Vice President, CTIA—The
Wireless Association;
• Ms. Diane Rinaldo, Executive Director, Open RAN Policy
Coalition; and
