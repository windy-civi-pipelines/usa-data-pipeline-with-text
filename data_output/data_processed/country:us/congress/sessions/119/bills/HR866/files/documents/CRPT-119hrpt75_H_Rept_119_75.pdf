PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 866, the Removing Our Unsecure Technologies to Ensure
Reliability and Security Act, or the ROUTERS Act, was introduced
by Representatives Robert E. Latta (R–OH) and Robin L. Kelly (D–
IL) on January 31, 2025. It would direct the Secretary of Com-
merce (Secretary), acting through the Assistant Secretary of Com-
merce for Communications and Information, to conduct a study on
the national security risks and cybersecurity vulnerabilities posed
by consumer routers, modems, and combined modem-router devices
designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by entities with
ties to foreign adversaries. The Secretary would be required to sub-
mit a report to Congress on the findings of this study within one
year of the enactment of the Act.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Routers and modems are key components of the communications
ecosystem. They are the equipment through which users and de-
vices connect to the internet. As a result, they are critical to com-
munications networks and a significant amount of data flows
through this equipment.
But routers and modems can include cybersecurity
vulnerabilities, opening them up to attacks from bad actors. In-
deed, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
have found vulnerabilities in routers that could be exploited for
cyberattacks.1

ed Vulnerabilities to Catalog, CYBERSECURITY ADVISORY (May. 1, 2023), https://www.cisa.gov/

These vulnerabilities are especially problematic with routers and
modems produced by entities with ties to foreign adversaries, par-
ticularly the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC). The PRC ‘‘probably currently represents the
broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S.
Government and private-sector networks.’’2 Indeed, the CCP could
exploit several PRC laws to force China-based companies to share
information companies collect on Americans or to sell unsecure
equipment in the United States that the CCP could exploit for
cyberattacks or espionage. For example, under the PRC’s National
Intelligence Law of 2017, the government can require individuals
and entities to support its intelligence services, including by pro-
viding data without regard to where that data was collected and
without any mechanism of due process.3 Additionally, the 2021
Data Security Law expands the PRC’s access to and control of com-
panies and data within China and imposes strict penalties on
China-based businesses for non-compliance. And the 2021 Cyber
Vulnerability Reporting Law requires Chinese-based companies to
disclose cyber vulnerabilities found in their systems or software to
PRC authorities prior to any public disclosure or sharing overseas.4
Given this, the CCP has the ability to exploit these laws by forcing
router and modem manufacturers in China to turn over data that
flows through the equipment they produce or sell vulnerable
modem and router equipment to consumers in the United States.
