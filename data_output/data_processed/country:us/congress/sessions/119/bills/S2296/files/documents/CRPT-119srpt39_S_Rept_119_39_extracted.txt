COMMITTEE OVERVIEW
Each year, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) au-
thorizes funding levels and provides authorities for the U.S. mili-
tary and other critical defense priorities, ensuring America’s forces
have the training, equipment, and resources they need to carry out
their missions.
On July 9, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 26–1 to
advance the NDAA for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 to the Senate floor.
Today, the United States is operating in the most dangerous
threat environment since World War II. We face an axis of aggres-
sors comprised of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and this
axis operates across multiple theaters. These nations share weap-
ons, resources, and a unifying objective: to dismantle American in-
fluence around the world. While many of the national security chal-
lenges we face resemble those of the past, warfare looks much dif-
ferent today. Technological advances in artificial intelligence, un-
manned technology, hypersonic strike weapons, sixth-generation
aircraft, and space-based weapons are transforming the nature of
modern conflict.
Thankfully, there is broad consensus among Congress, the White
House, the Department of Defense, and key allies about these cur-
rent threats and the need to address them. Recognizing the com-
plexity of today’s geopolitical environment, our nation must take
action toward reindustrialization and work to rebuild the arsenal
of democracy.
To achieve this, we must advance significant reforms to mod-
ernize the Pentagon’s budgeting and acquisition operations. This
bill implements key Pentagon reforms to improve efficiency, un-
leash innovation, and modernize the budget process. Ultimately,
our servicemembers must have the resources they need to carry out
their duties successfully, and the American people deserve oper-
ational efficiency from their government. Both are achievable.
BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF THIS ACT (SEC. 4)
The committee recommends a provision that would require that
the budgetary effects of this Act be determined in accordance with
the procedures established in the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of
2010 (Public Law 111–139).
SUMMARY OF DISCRETIONARY AUTHORIZATIONS AND
BUDGET AUTHORITY IMPLICATION
The administration’s budget request for national defense discre-
tionary programs within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee
on Armed Services for fiscal year 2026 was $848.5 billion for base
Department of Defense (DOD) programs and $33.8 billion for na-
tional security programs in the Department of Energy (DOE).
The committee recommends an overall discretionary authoriza-
tion of $925.8 billion in fiscal year 2026, including $879.3 billion for
base DOD programs, $35.2 billion for national security programs in
the DOE, and $11.3 billion for defense-related activities outside the
jurisdiction of the NDAA.

for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 123 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), by extending the prohibition on replac-
ing existing waterborne security barriers with the current barriers.
The provision would require the Secretary of the Navy to submit
a plan to the congressional defense committees, not later than
April 1, 2026, that would: (1) Develop a formal set of requirements
for waterborne barriers; (2) Certify that the requirements exceed
the capability of existing barriers; (3) Produce an acquisition strat-
egy to meet the requirements; and (4) Submit a plan for acquiring
waterborne security barriers using full and open competition. The
provision would require implementation of the plan by September
30, 2027.
Sec. 124—Modification to limitations on Navy medium and
large unmanned surface vessels
The committee recommends a provision that would repeal section
122 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) and replace
it with new requirements.
Sec. 125—Limitation on availability of funds for TAGOS ship
program

tation on the availability of funds for the Tactical Auxiliary Gen-
eral Ocean Surveillance (TAGOS) ship program pending the sub-
mission of a report by the Secretary of the Navy on the maturity
of the design for the TAGOS vessels, among other things.
Sec. 126—Limitation on availability of funds relating to am-
phibious warfare ship requirement
The committee recommends a provision that would limit certain
funds for the Secretary of the Navy unless the 30-year shipbuilding
plan for fiscal year 2027 meets the requirement to maintain 31 am-
phibious warfare ships pursuant to section 8062 of title 10, United
States Code. The provision would further limit certain funds for the
Secretary of Defense unless the defense budget materials for fiscal
year 2027 support the same requirement for 31 amphibious war-
fare ships.
Sec. 127—Temporary unavailability of amphibious warfare
ships
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 8062 of title 10, United States Code, to define ‘‘temporarily un-
available’’ to be a ship that has not surpassed its planned mainte-
nance availability by certain margins. Ships that exceed those mar-
gins would no longer count toward filling the requirement to main-
tain 31 amphibious ships.

Subtitle D—Air Force Programs
Sec. 131—B–21 bomber aircraft program accountability mat-
rices
The committee recommends a provision that replaces section 238
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017
(Public Law 114–238) with a new provision to account for advances
in the B–21 program as it advances from engineering to manufac-
turing and production. The provision would direct the Secretary of
the Air Force to submit, beginning with the President’s annual
budget request for fiscal year 2027 and every 180 days after, infor-
mation on B–21 program costs, goals, and program execution to the
congressional defense committees and the Comptroller General of
the United States. The provision would further direct the Comp-
troller General, not less frequently than annually, to review the in-
formation submitted by the Secretary of the Air Force and submit
to the congressional defense committees an assessment of this in-
formation.
Sec. 132—Bomber aircraft force structure and transition
roadmap
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Air Force to submit a comprehensive bomber road-
map, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of
this Act.
The committee supports the Air Force’s continued modernization
of the bomber force to ensure credible long-range strike capabilities
against peer adversaries. This includes transitioning from legacy
platforms to the B–21, modernizing the B–52 to remain operational
through the 2050s, and responsibly divesting the aging B–1 fleet.
The committee is also interested in the Department of the Air
Force’s efforts to more fully integrate the reserve components into
next-generation bomber operations to enhance readiness, increase
operational flexibility, and improve cost-effectiveness.
The committee wants this roadmap to ensure that the Air Force
implements a coherent, phased transition that will maintain global
strike capacity and align with long-term force design and deter-
rence objectives. This roadmap should: (1) Establish the full
timeline for bomber modernization; (2) Identify key decision points
on that timeline; (3) Explain the strategic rationale for platform di-
vestments, capability fielding, and modernization investments
across the bomber fleet; and (4) Specify the planned role of the Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve in the future bomber force.
The committee expects this roadmap to serve as a tool for over-
sight, risk mitigation, and long-term resourcing. The committee
also reiterates its support for the Air Force to acquire and field no
fewer than 100 B–21 aircraft.
Sec. 133—Requirement for an intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance roadmap for the Air Force
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Air Force to submit a comprehensive intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) roadmap to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than 180 days after the date

of enactment of this Act. This roadmap should outline the Air
Force’s strategic vision for ISR across air, space, and cyberspace do-
mains and must include: (1) An assessment of current and pro-
jected ISR requirements, including ISR support to joint and coali-
tion operations; (2) An inventory of existing ISR systems and plat-
forms, including associated capabilities, readiness levels, and ex-
pected service lives; (3) Plans for modernization or divestment of
legacy ISR systems and the rationale for each such decision; (4)
Planned investments in emerging ISR technologies, including arti-
ficial intelligence, autonomy, and space-based capabilities; (5) A
strategy for integrating ISR data into command and control sys-
tems, ensuring interoperability with other services and allied
forces; (6) An assessment of potential capability gaps, risks, and
proposed mitigation strategies; and (7) Implementation timelines
and key milestones over the next 10 fiscal years.
The committee is concerned with the lack of a comprehensive
and unified roadmap for the future of capabilities across the U.S.
Air Force. As global threats evolve and near-peer competitors con-
tinue to invest in advanced ISR technologies, the committee be-
lieves that a clearly articulated strategy is necessary to guide the
Air Force’s ISR investment, divestment, and integration decisions
over the next decade.
The committee expects this report to be submitted in unclassified
form, but the Secretary may include a classified annex as appro-
priate.
Sec. 134—Annual report on Department of Defense unified
datalink strategy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1527 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to require annual reports through 2032
on the Department of Defense’s datalink strategy. These reports
are to include updated implementation timelines for each element
of the strategy outlined in subsection (a)(2) of section 1527, as well
as detailed accounts of both funding and execution efforts planned
or undertaken during the current fiscal year.
The committee continues to emphasize the critical importance of
resilient, interoperable, and secure datalink capabilities as a foun-
dation for Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and
future warfighting concepts. Building on the requirement estab-
lished by section 1527, the committee believes sustained oversight
is essential to ensure the Department achieves measurable
progress toward an integrated and future-ready datalink enter-
prise.
The committee expects these annual reports to provide clear visi-
bility into datalink modernization across platforms, services, and
domains, including efforts to address legacy system integration,
electromagnetic spectrum resilience, software-defined datalinks,
and coalition interoperability.
Sec. 135—Plan for open mission systems of F–35 aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive plan to establish
a government-controlled open mission systems computing environ-

ment for all variants and blocks of the F–35 aircraft operated by
the Department of Defense and to deliver a report describing this
plan to the congressional defense committees, not later than July
1, 2026.
The committee recognizes the strategic imperative of enabling
rapid, secure, and cost-effective modernization of the Department
of Defense’s fifth-generation aircraft, including the F–35. An open
mission systems computing environment that is government-con-
trolled would reduce reliance on proprietary architectures, enhance
joint interoperability, and allow for the rapid integration of ad-
vanced capabilities across platforms.
Sec. 136—Modification of prohibition on retirement of F–15E
aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 9062(l)(1) of title 10, United States Code, by striking ‘‘Sep-
tember 30, 2029’’ and inserting ‘‘September 30, 2027’’ and by strik-
ing ‘‘68 F–15E aircraft’’ and inserting ‘‘34 F–15E aircraft.’’ The pro-
vision would also repeal certain portions of section 150 of the Serv-
icemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
Sec. 137—Prohibition on retirement of A–10 aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Air Force from divesting A–10 aircraft below the inventory level of
103 in fiscal year 2026.
Sec. 138—Extension of limitations and minimum inventory
requirement relating to RQ–4 aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 9062(m)(1) of title 10, United States Code, by extending the
limitation through September 30, 2030 for the requirement that
the Air Force maintain a minimum inventory of RQ–4 aircraft.
Sec. 139—Expansion of air refueler fleet
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the Air
Force to reassign KC–135 tanker aircraft that are replaced by KC–
46 tanker aircraft to existing air refueling wings with the ability
to absorb a larger fleet.
Sec. 140—Requirements relating to C–130 aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would extend the
minimum inventory requirement for C–130 aircraft, extend prohibi-
tions on reduction of the C–130 aircraft assigned to the Air Na-
tional Guard, and direct the Secretary of the Air Force to submit
an annual report to the congressional defense committees providing
information on the Air Force’s C–130 inventory.
Sec. 141—Information on future large and oversized air
cargo transportation services

Items of Special Interest
Acceleration of Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile Program
The committee supports the Department of the Air Force’s con-
tinued development of hypersonic strike capabilities, including the
Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program. As peer adver-
saries invest heavily in advanced long-range systems, the United
States must ensure timely fielding of survivable, precision-strike
options capable of penetrating integrated air defense systems. The
committee is interested in the Air Force’s plans to accelerate this
timeline where feasible, including steps to ensure industrial base
readiness and early production.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, on the plan to transition the HACM to
production. The briefing must include: (1) Identification of key pro-
gram milestones and funding requirements, by the fiscal year, nec-
essary to deliver tactically relevant quantities of HACM by October
1, 2029; (2) Assessment of opportunities for producibility improve-
ments or capability enhancements that could accelerate the
timeline to initial operational capability; and (3) A description of
industrial facilitization and supply chain investments needed to
support production, including any associated schedule risks or con-
straints.
Acoustic system for passive surveillance
The committee notes that the Army has been testing a multi-
array, non-line-of-sight, passive surveillance system with sensors
that can detect and track acoustic emissions from threat platforms
while rejecting signals from commercial aircraft and other ambient
noise sources. Such a system has broad applications for developing
situational awareness in congested airspaces to identify incursions
of recreational drones or other threats in an operational environ-
ment, such as at joint-use airports.
Therefore, the committee encourages the National Guard Bu-
reau, in consultation with Reserve and Active-Duty partners, to ex-
amine the utility of these systems specifically at joint-use airports
and Combat Readiness Training Centers during military exercises
focused on contingency response operations.
Advanced Combat Engine
The committee is encouraged by the Department of the Army’s
development of a more fuel-efficient, lower-emission, and cost-effi-
cient engine to support Next Generation Combat Vehicles. Based
on the successful demonstrations at Camp Grayling and Yuma
Proving Grounds, the committee expects the Department of the
Army to continue development and then transition to the fielding
of this critical powertrain solution.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:16 Jul 19, 2025 Jkt 061121 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 E:\HR\OC\SR039.XXX SR039

resentatives on funding requirements and fielding plans to inte-
grate the Advanced Combat Engine into current and next-genera-
tion combat vehicles.
Aeromedical evacuation platform inventory requirements
The committee recognizes the importance of aeromedical evacu-
ation capabilities but is concerned that the Department of the
Army may have insufficient capacity to meet requirements for the
range of missions the Army may be called to support. It is critical
that the Army maintain the right mix of capabilities to meet con-
tingency training, humanitarian assistance, and operations require-
ments.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
detailing the Army’s inventory of aeromedical evacuation platforms
as of the date on which the report is submitted, as well as the pro-
jected inventory of such platforms in 2030. The report shall also in-
clude: (1) The number of HH–60M aircraft in the Army inventory
configured for aeromedical evacuation; (2) The number of UH–60L
or other utility helicopters equipped with an aeromedical evacu-
ation interior; (3) The number of LUH–72 aircraft configured or
used for aeromedical evacuation missions; and (4) The minimum
number of aircraft, by type, required to support: (a) geographic and
functional combatant commanders; (b) contingency operations and
operational plans; (c) defense support to civil authorities and chem-
ical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response force missions;
(d) humanitarian assistance and disaster response missions; and
(e) installation support for garrison emergency medical response
operations.
The report required shall be submitted in unclassified form but
may include a classified annex.
Airborne fire control radars
The committee is aware that the U.S. Air Force and the U.S.
Navy primarily rely on two suppliers to equip fighter aircraft with
fire control radars. These radars allow aircraft to detect, target,
identify, and engage or avoid airborne and ground threats at
tactically significant ranges. United States air dominance is predi-
cated on fielding premier fighters with innovative weapons and
sensors, and this in turn depends on a healthy industrial base.
The committee strongly encourages the Department of Defense to
be cognizant of the radar industrial base implications of pending
tactical air acquisition decisions, including the risk to the engineer-
ing workforce from further program delays, and expects that the
Department would seek to mitigate the implications of any such
delay with appropriate industrial base investment. Further, the
committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial
Base Policy to review the risks to and resilience of the fire control
radar industrial base and provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 31, 2026, with recommendations to mitigate
any identified industrial base risks.

Army aviation transformation
The committee is aware of the Army’s plan to significantly re-
duce the force structure of Army Combat Aviation Brigades, to in-
clude divesting of Air Cavalry Squadrons. While the committee
supports the cost savings of pure fleeting to AH–64E Apache air-
craft, the committee is concerned about the lack of details regard-
ing the proposed realignment, particularly how the Army will
maintain sufficient capability and capacity through its trans-
formation. The committee is interested in Apache Future Develop-
ment funding and its alignment with Army Transformation Initia-
tive goals, including efforts on manned-unmanned teaming,
launched effects, and modular open system approach implementa-
tion.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than February 15, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on the combat aviation transformation efforts that includes:
(1) The rationale supporting the Army aviation force structure deci-
sion; (2) The investment plan to sustain and modernize the endur-
ing AH–64E Apache fleet across the Future Years Defense Program
(FYDP); (3) A detailed description of current technologies capable
of assuming the reconnaissance role of the Air Cavalry Squadrons,
to ensure there are no capability gaps; (4) A detailed plan describ-
ing the quantities of AH–64E required, by component, across the
FYDP; and (5) Any other matters the Secretary determines rel-
evant.
Army command and control systems software
The committee supports the objectives of the Army’s new net-
work modernization strategy, which aims to field simpler, more in-
tuitive, flexible, and lower signature command and control capabili-
ties across its formations. The committee also notes the significant
investments the Army has previously made in developing and field-
ing its Integrated Tactical Network. Given rapid advances in com-
mercial software and overall budgetary challenges, the committee
would like to better understand how the Army is taking advantage
of its prior investment in commercially developed command and
control software as it pivots its Next Generation Command and
Control (NGC2) strategy.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
on command and control software as it relates to the Army’s NGC2
strategy. The report shall include the following: (1) An identifica-
tion of the capabilities and requirements the Army is seeking in a
new suite of command and control software; (2) The schedule, ac-
quisition strategy, costs, and affordability assessment associated
with the development of new command and control software for
theater, corps, division, and below headquarters; (3) An assessment
of the Army’s prior investment in commercial, off-the-shelf software
for its network strategy and its plans to maintain commercially de-
veloped software to meet its future command and control needs; (4)
Details on the Army’s plans to mandate interoperability with
NATO and Indo-Pacific allies as a requirement in its new command

Secretary considers relevant.
Army Digital Engineering Center of Excellence
The committee remains supportive of previous efforts to establish
a Digital Engineering Center of Excellence led by the Army Ground
Vehicle System Center. This effort will apply the U.S. Army’s dig-
ital transformation effort to all parts of the vehicle lifecycle, includ-
ing development, manufacturing, fleet maintenance (including pro-
ducing an inventory of obsolete parts, which are no longer manu-
factured, for deployed weapon systems), and the ability to virtually
and physically prototype next generation ground systems. The com-
mittee believes that a Digital Engineering Center of Excellence
would provide the government and its academic partners with an
avenue whereby the warfighter can meet the growing threats by
rapidly fielding capabilities that are both current and emerging.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 20, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives detailing the status of the establishment of a Digital
Engineering Center of Excellence. The briefing shall include, at a
minimum, information about the Army’s planning for and imple-
mentation of digital engineering practices across the lifecycle of its
vehicles. It should also include Army efforts to capitalize on the ca-
pabilities of domestic academic partners in this endeavor.
Army Ground Combat Vehicles
The committee supports the Army’s decision to accelerate its
M1E3 tank modernization program and to continue investment in
its next-generation combat vehicle program, XM–30. The committee
is concerned with the shift in the autonomous ground combat vehi-
cle efforts and would like to better understand how the Army in-
tends to incorporate remote ground combat vehicle investments to
date into its future formations. Additionally, with years of lagging
investment in Armored Brigade Combat Team modernization and
near-term focus on Infantry Brigade Combat Team organization
and structure, the committee is concerned about the Army’s plan-
ning and investment strategy for modernizing its heavier forma-
tions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than October 10, 2025, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, on the Army’s concept for delivering modernized ground com-
bat vehicles to its Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Teams.
The briefing shall include: (1) A description of brigade combat team
structure, by vehicle type, as planned; (2) A projected timeline for
modernizing these formations across the active and reserve compo-
nents; (3) Procurement quantities and funding through the future
years defense program; and (4) Any other matters the Secretary be-
lieves relevant.
Army load-carrying technology advancements

tive outcomes associated with the Maneuverable Lightweight Elec-
tric Weight Reducer (MLEWR) efforts, including incorporating Si-
lent Tactical Energy Enhanced Dismount and associated Modular
Mission Payloads (MMP) into U.S. Army Transformation-in-Con-
tact events, highlight the potential for significant enhancements in
troop mobility, lethality, and survivability. Further, the committee
understands that the U.S. Army developed an Abbreviated Capa-
bility Development Document for the Dismount Unit Soldier Trans-
port (DUST) based on the MLEWR effort. We applaud U.S. Army
efforts to rapidly experiment, procure, and deploy these capabili-
ties.
The committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a
briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on:
(1) The procurement plan for DUST capabilities; (2) An analysis of
the utility of the MMPs developed at the direct request of units; (3)
How MMPs fit into the procurement plan; and (4) A summary of
current activities on the platforms within the DUST and MLEWR
efforts.
Army Prepositioned Stocks
The committee understands that the Army is developing concepts
to optimize its Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS) program. As stra-
tegically positioned sets of equipment with rolling stock and weap-
on systems, APS are designed to reduce deployment response
times. Recent actions, including Army efforts to move away from
afloat stocks and issuance of stop-work notices for other APS sets
due to lack of funding, raise serious concerns about the Army’s
commitment to this critical capability.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, on Army efforts to optimize its APS programs to en-
sure it has the right equipment in the right location with the right
readiness level. The briefing shall include: (1) Planned posture, lo-
cation, and structure of stocks; (2) Intended readiness model; (3)
Plan to maintain visibility of equipment sets; (4) Future facility re-
quirements, including modernization requirements of current facili-
ties; (5) Planned governance structure that mitigates noted defi-
ciencies in current management model; and (6) Planned funding for
the APS program through the future years defense program.
Assessment of hypersonic materials manufacturing and in-
dustrial base
The committee supports the Department of Defense’s ongoing ef-
forts to expand and strengthen the U.S. hypersonic weapons indus-
trial base, which is critical to the development and fielding of cur-
rent and future hypersonic and reentry systems in alignment with
the National Defense Strategy. To ensure continued progress in
this area and mitigate supply chain risks, the committee empha-
sizes the need for a comprehensive assessment of the resilience and
scalability of the industrial base supporting these technologies.
The committee notes that hypersonic systems and reentry vehi-
cles used in strategic systems operate under extreme thermal and

structural stress, relying on advanced high-temperature materials,
including Thermal Protection System (TPS) components. The com-
mittee understands that one such material, Carbon/Carbon (C/C)
composite, is essential due to its ability to withstand extreme heat.
However, the manufacturing of these materials, especially through
processes such as densification, which makes the material stronger
and more heat-resistant, remains slow and presents a key produc-
tion bottleneck. These constraints, along with limitations in ma-
chining, assembly, and specialized workforce availability, present
challenges to scaling production to meet national security needs.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026,
on the state of the U.S. hypersonic materials manufacturing and
industrial base. The briefing shall include: (1) An evaluation of cur-
rent Carbon/Carbon composite densification capabilities, including
capacity limitations and throughput challenges; (2) An analysis of
emerging or alternative densification processes being developed or
utilized by industry that could significantly accelerate production
and reduce cost; (3) A review of key bottlenecks across the indus-
trial base, including in the areas of materials fabrication, precision
machining, and system assembly, along with recommendations to
address these constraints and improve scalability; (4) An assess-
ment of material performance and durability under extreme ther-
mal and mechanical conditions relevant to hypersonic and reentry
applications; (5) Recommendations for targeted investments in in-
frastructure, workforce development, and manufacturing capabili-
ties needed to strengthen domestic production capacity; and (6) A
strategy to optimize production throughput, control costs, and re-
duce dependency on foreign sources of critical materials or compo-
nents.
The committee expects this briefing to inform future oversight
and investment decisions aimed at ensuring the U.S. hypersonic in-
dustrial base is resilient, responsive, and capable of meeting na-
tional defense requirements.
Briefing on Conventional Prompt Strike advanced capa-
bility development
The committee notes the role that the Navy Conventional Prompt
Strike (CPS) weapon will play in potential Indo-Pacific contin-
gencies. The committee is concerned, however, that adversaries’
abilities to counter various U.S. munitions are improving at a rapid
pace.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of Navy Strategic
Systems Programs, in coordination with the Director of the Army’s
Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, to brief the
congressional defense committees on the CPS program’s Advanced
Capability Program for addressing navigation and interceptor
threats that could reduce the capability of the CPS system. The Di-
rector should provide that briefing not later than October 1, 2025.
The briefing should address: (1) The current threat assessment for
the baseline CPS program and the level of expected capability deg-
radation from those threats that the baseline CPS is expected to
experience; (2) Future technology insertion points to enhance per-

the Advanced Capability Program through fiscal year 2031; (4) The
technologies and capabilities being developed with that funding;
and (5) Whether the funding plan is sufficient to adequately ad-
dress wartime survivability and lethality requirements.
C–130 propeller study
The committee supports the Navy and Air Force in their respec-
tive propeller retrofit programs across multiple platforms. Having
the safest, most reliable, and highest-performing propellers across
aircraft enhances operational readiness and contributes to the over-
all airlift mission. The committee understands the Navy and Air
Force will finish retrofitting the entire C–130H fleet this year with
an 8-bladed propeller system, while the C–130J currently operates
with a legacy 6-bladed propeller system.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the Navy and
Air Force to conduct a comparative study, independent of the air
vehicle manufacturer, on the two propeller systems on each plat-
form that would, at a minimum, provide a comparative analysis
that includes the following for the preceding fiscal year: (1) Quan-
tify propeller removals due to propeller-specific issues for both sys-
tems; (2) Identify the mean time between failure and mean time
between removal of each system; (3) Identify maintenance costs,
both dollars and man-hours, to maintain each propeller system; (4)
Quantify mission aborts due to propeller system issues for both
systems; and (5) Include any other relevant data or analysis rel-
evant for comparing the two systems.
The Secretaries should provide this report to the congressional
defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026.
C–130H divestment plan
The committee is aware of the Air Force’s plans to divest por-
tions of the C–130H fleet as part of ongoing modernization and
force structure adjustments. The committee emphasizes the impor-
tance of maintaining mission capability and readiness at installa-
tions affected by such changes, particularly within the Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve.
To ensure transparency and informed oversight, the committee
directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a briefing to the
congressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026.
The briefing should address: (1) Installations impacted by C–130H
divestment; (2) Potential new or replacement flying missions under
consideration for affected bases; (3) Anticipated personnel and in-
frastructure implications; and (4) The status of coordination with
state and local stakeholders.
The committee expects the Air Force to remain engaged with af-
fected communities and to keep the Congress informed throughout
the decision-making process.
CMV–22 enhancement

off and landing capabilities. The program has improved the V–22’s
endurance, but not all V–22s have yet received the improvements.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Secretary of the Navy
to integrate nacelle improvement modifications into the CMV–22B
aircraft fleet to improve readiness and reliability and to help sus-
tain the tiltrotor industrial base.
Collaborative Combat Aircraft program
The committee remains concerned about the rapid military
growth of U.S. adversaries and the speed at which mass-produced,
modern capabilities are proliferating, threatening the air superi-
ority that has underpinned U.S. military dominance for decades. To
counter these threats, the committee encourages the Air Force to
continue pursuing initiatives that enable the affordable and rapid
fielding of capable airpower at scale.
The committee remains strongly supportive of the Collaborative
Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, particularly Increment 1. In just
a few years, the CCA program has progressed from conceptual de-
velopment to the verge of production and fielding of an operation-
ally relevant capability while leveraging technologically advanced
contributions from an expanding industrial base. While CCAs are
envisioned to operate alongside fighter aircraft, the committee is
also supportive of the potential for autonomous aircraft and the ex-
pansion of these capabilities to other missions traditionally con-
ducted by manned platforms. However, the committee is concerned
that the Air Force has not articulated a clear and detailed plan to
integrate the F–35A into the CCA concept of operations, despite
the F–35’s central role in the future fighter force.
The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide
a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than December 15, 2025, on
the service’s plans to transition CCA Increment 1 prototypes to
full-scale production. The Secretary’s briefing should include: (1)
The associated resource requirements; (2) Plans for incorporating
the reserve components into the CCA operational structure; (3) A
detailed description of the Air Force’s approach to integrating
CCAs with fifth-generation platforms, including the F–35A; (4)
Technical integration and mission pairing concepts; (5) Data link
and software interoperability; and (6) Operational test planning.
The committee further requests that the Air Force provide regular
updates on the progress of fielding CCA capability, including the
integration of these systems into operational squadrons.
Comptroller General review of tiltrotor technology
The committee remains concerned about the safety record of the
V–22 program and believes that an independent group should as-
sess the safety, operational viability, and cost-effectiveness of the
V–22 program.
The committee directs the Comptroller General of the United
States to conduct a comprehensive review of the V–22 program.
The Comptroller General should submit a report based on the re-
view, not later than December 31, 2026, and include the following:
(1) An assessment of the safety, cost, reliability, and performance
of the V–22 Osprey aircraft across the Department of Defense

involving V–22 Osprey aircraft; and (b) the cost growth, mainte-
nance and supply issues, availability rates, and overall contribu-
tions to military readiness of the V–22 Osprey program; (3) An ex-
amination of the mechanical and design characteristics of the V–
22 Osprey aircraft and an assessment of the role such characteris-
tics have played in accidents and other V–22 Osprey program
issues; (4) An assessment of the Department’s efforts and levels of
success in addressing accidents and other issues with the V–22 Os-
prey program, including the Department’s approach to mitigating
risk and improving aircraft reliability; (5) Identification of options
available to the Department to address any ongoing issues with the
V–22 Osprey program and strengthen safety, reliability, and cost-
effectiveness across the V–22 Osprey aircraft fleet; (6) An assess-
ment of any data available from testing of the Future Long-Range
Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program related to safety, operating and
support costs, reliability, and any other performance measures; (7)
An estimate of the extent to which actual data from the V–22 pro-
gram would be useful in projecting: (a) attrition rates; (b) operating
and support costs; and (c) operational readiness rates; and (8) An
assessment of DOD efforts to incorporate lessons learned from the
development and deployment of the V–22 for the FLRAA program.
Concerns about accelerated divestment of A–10 aircraft
The committee is gravely concerned by the Department of the Air
Force’s decision to accelerate full divestment of the A–10 fleet in
fiscal year 2026, 3 years ahead of the previously stated glidepath.
This decision, disclosed only through fiscal year 2026 budget docu-
ments and not through direct communication with Congress, rep-
resents a fundamental breach of transparency and undermines
prior commitments to responsibly manage force structure changes.
The Department’s decision to proceed with full divestment, with-
out providing mission transition plans for affected units or ensur-
ing sufficient combat capacity replacement, raises serious concerns
about readiness, force distribution, and the Department’s commit-
ment to responsible stewardship.
Of particular concern is the lack of communication with or con-
sideration for A–10 units that are currently deployed in support of
combatant commands. These units are actively supporting ongoing
operational requirements, and to propose their divestment imme-
diately upon return from deployment—without replacement mis-
sions or personnel transition plans—damages the credibility of the
Department and risks future recruitment and retention of pilots
and maintainers across the total force.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide, not later than January 15, 2026, a briefing for the con-
gressional defense committees that includes:
(1) A list of all A–10 units scheduled for divestment in fiscal
year 2026, fiscal year 2027, and fiscal year 2028, including lo-
cation, component (Active, Guard, Reserve), number of aircraft,
and whether the unit is currently deployed or scheduled for de-
ployment during that period;

(a) a timeline for drawdown and divestment;
(b) replacement mission plans and associated aircraft,

(c) personnel transition plans and impacts (e.g., re-
assignments, retention, recruiting shortfalls); and
(3) An assessment of the operational risk incurred by remov-
ing the A–10 fleet from the inventory on an accelerated
timeline.
Consideration of additional F–16 aircraft procurement
The committee recognizes the continued relevance of the F–16
Fighting Falcon in meeting U.S. and allied tactical air require-
ments, particularly in support of homeland defense, partner capac-
ity-building, and theater security cooperation. As the Department
of the Air Force continues to modernize its fighter fleet, the com-
mittee believes that procuring additional new-build F–16 aircraft
could provide a cost-effective means to augment force structure and
mitigate near-term capacity gaps caused by legacy aircraft retire-
ments.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than December
1, 2025, on the feasibility, cost, and strategic benefit of procuring
additional Block 70/72 F–16 aircraft. The briefing should include:
(1) An evaluation of potential roles and missions for additional F–
16 aircraft in the context of Air National Guard and active-duty
force utilization; (2) An analysis of production capacity and
timelines from the F–16 production line, including options to accel-
erate delivery; and (3) An estimate of procurement costs, including
unit cost comparisons with alternative platforms.
The committee encourages the Air Force to seriously consider the
benefits of additional F–16 procurement as part of a balanced and
affordable tactical airpower strategy.
Considerations for Agile Combat Employment
The committee supports the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employ-
ment (ACE) concept and emphasizes the need to rapidly reconsti-
tute airfield operations and defend forward locations in contested
environments. Three critical capability areas require continued de-
velopment: (1) Clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO); (2)
Deployable precision landing surveillance systems in GPS-denied
conditions; and (3) Mobile air base defense systems.
The committee notes the Recovery of Air Bases Denied by Ord-
nance (RADBO) vehicle provides vital UXO clearance capabilities
but relies on the legacy Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle
platform. The committee is encouraged by efforts to transition
RADBO capabilities to the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The com-
mittee is also concerned with the Air Force’s ability to deploy preci-
sion landing systems to austere airfields in GPS-denied environ-
ments and notes the need for lightweight, rapidly deployable solu-
tions. Additionally, the committee notes the potential use of the
Army’s Land-Based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) for contrib-
uting to air base defense but recognizes modifications are required
for C–130 transportability.

Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, on plans to support ACE through: (1)
Transition and future requirements for RADBO, including platform
modernization; (2) Current and planned capabilities for deployable
surveillance and precision landing in GPS-denied environments;
and (3) Assessment of LPWS suitability for air base defense, in-
cluding potential redesign for expeditionary use.
The committee expects this briefing to include cost, schedule,
operational concepts, and requirements to ensure the Air Force can
project and sustain combat power from dispersed, austere locations.
Counter unmanned aerial system policy
The committee notes that the war in Ukraine has led to an ex-
plosion of innovation in technology and tactics when it comes to
technology and tactics for both Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)
and counter-UAS (cUAS). This was most dramatically dem-
onstrated in Ukraine’s early June Operation Spiderweb, in which
Ukraine launched over 100 first person view (FPV) drones from
deep within Russian territory, dealing a significant blow to the
Russian air force.
The committee recognizes that this not only demonstrated the in-
genuity and capability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, it high-
lighted our own vulnerabilities to FPV drones—a dramatic cul-
mination of concerns that have been growing in the committee for
years.
PM 17–00X, Supplemental Guidance for Countering Unmanned
Aircraft, provides critical guidance to the Department of Defense
(DOD) and military services—including the definition of ‘‘threat’’
under section 130i of title 10, United States Code, and delineating
when and how the Department can track and engage UAS threats.
However, this guidance dates back to 2017, long before the war in
Ukraine rapidly accelerated UAS technology and tactics.
Accordingly, the committee recommends that the Secretary of
Defense update PM 17–00X and provide a briefing to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives at a mutually agreed upon time, not later than February 15,
2026, on the following: (1) Plans to update PM 17–00X to account
for changes in technology, tactics, and threats to DOD installations
since 2017; (2) A reassessment of the PM 17–00X definition of
‘‘threat’’ under section 130i of title 10, United States Code, to ac-
count for the ongoing physical and surveillance threat a fast-mov-
ing UAS poses to a covered asset or facility even as it departs a
military installation; (3) An assessment of whether overflight and
surveillance activities should be considered a physical threat to
DOD personnel, systems, and facilities given the ease with which
small FPV drones can be configured with offensive capabilities and
the lack of reaction time their speed affords servicemembers on
base; (4) An assessment of when kinetic cUAS options should be
employed, especially in light of advances in artificial intelligence
and non-radio frequency means of UAS guidance; (5) An assess-
ment of any legislative changes required to provide cUAS protec-
tion to private shipyards actively building U.S. Navy vessels and
whether that varies depending on the type of ship under construc-

tion; (6) Any barriers in statute that prevent a comprehensive pol-
icy update by the Department.
Counter unmanned aerial systems delegation of authority
The committee is concerned that current Department of Defense
policy may not adequately support the timely use of force against
unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that pose a threat to U.S. military
installations. In particular, the committee notes that delegation of
use-of-force authority from the Secretary of Defense to service-re-
tained units is operationally challenging in the absence of standing
identification procedures and clearly defined rules of engagement
tailored to UAS threats. Without such frameworks, installation
commanders and their subordinates may be constrained in their
ability to respond immediately and effectively to hostile or sus-
picious UAS activity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026.
The report shall outline a plan for ensuring installation com-
manders have delegated authority to immediately use force—ki-
netic or non-kinetic—against UAS posing a threat to personnel, in-
frastructure, or operations.
The plan shall include: (1) A framework for delegation of use-of-
force authority below the Secretary of Defense level; (2) Criteria
and procedures for immediate engagement of UAS under various
threat conditions; (3) An assessment of the required coordination
with civil authorities, including the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion and the Department of Homeland Security; (4) Requirements
for installation-level response plans, training, and reporting; and
(5) An assessment of legal compliance with title 10 and title 18,
United States Code. The committee expects the Department to en-
sure that commanders are fully empowered through appropriate
delegation, standing rules, and coordination procedures to defend
installations promptly and lawfully against emerging UAS threats.
Counter unmanned aircraft system pilot program
The committee is aware that incidents of unmanned aerial sys-
tems (UAS) intruding in Department of Defense (DOD)-managed
airspace have been growing at an alarming rate. UAS events
around Hampton, Virginia, and in the New Jersey and New York
areas point out the urgent need for rapid responses and innovation
in counter-UAS (cUAS) systems and processes.
To ensure rapid responses and smooth operations in a crisis,
DOD facilities must have the equipment before anything happens
and must have worked out and exercised agreements with other
Federal, state, and local organizations beforehand.
The committee believes that it would behoove the DOD to estab-
lish one or more pilot programs that would demonstrate and exer-
cise the processes for responding to incursions. Such a demonstra-
tion should address: (1) Sharing situational awareness data from
civilian sensor networks to military installation defense systems;
(2) Sharing DOD situational awareness data with appropriate state
and local officials; (3) Ensuring that other Federal agencies have
the same merged operation picture; (4) Developing capabilities for

cUAS systems; and (5) Assessing what authorities and capability
shortfalls should be further addressed to enhance cooperation be-
tween the DOD, civilian partners, and other U.S. Government enti-
ties.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a re-
port to the congressional defense committees, not later than March
1, 2026, on the recommendations for establishing one or more pilot
programs for implementing and testing standard operating proce-
dures among the interested parties and assessing capability short-
falls.
Deployable expandable shelters
The committee recognizes that the Army’s Standard Family of
Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF RWS) program standardizes shelter sys-
tems to deliver mature, cost-effective technologies to soldiers. This
standardization reduces expenses, simplifies logistics, and en-
hances field support. The committee believes the program provides
critical capabilities that align with key strategic priorities, includ-
ing the Army Campaign Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy,
and the Army Arctic Strategy.
The committee supports prioritizing investment in medical and
Temporary Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (TSCIF)
variants of the Expandable, Panelized, and Collapsible Shelters
(EPACS) within the ASF RWS program. These variants are essen-
tial for maintaining strategic advantage and ensuring operational
readiness across military units.
In addition, the committee recognizes the growing importance of
Expeditionary Shelter Protection Systems (ESPS) in enhancing
contested logistics operations, such as fuel distribution and food
provision. ESPS systems have been deployed at the Army’s Combat
Training Centers (CTCs) to simulate battlefield effects and provide
direct exposure to end-users.
The committee encourages the Army to expand procurement and
fielding of ESPS across CTCs and other operational environments
to further demonstrate their utility and transition the program into
the base budget.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives that addresses the ASF RWS program’s current status
and future requirements, including the following elements: (1) An
assessment of the existing Army shelter program, including EPACS
and ESPS variants; (2) Any challenges identified in developing
EPACS TSCIF, medical, and infrastructure protection variants; (3)
The operational advantages of deploying EPACS TSCIF, ESPS, and
alternative shelter configurations to Army units; (4) The funding
levels and legal authorities required to fully resource all shelter
programs, including recommendations for integrating ESPS into
annual budget submissions; and (5) A recommended approach for
rapidly fielding these capabilities at the lowest cost to the Govern-
ment.

Diversification of Army counter unmanned aerial systems
The committee recognizes the complex threat environment the
Joint Force faces from advanced adversarial Unmanned Aerial Sys-
tems (UAS) capabilities and supports the military services’ recent
efforts to utilize the Unfunded Priority List process, supplemental
funding, and novel contracting approaches, such as U.S. Special
Operations Command’s System Integrations Partnership (SIP), to
procure Group 3 defeat interceptors and integrate innovative sys-
tems into existing Army programs.
The committee notes that production and use of advanced Group
3 systems by our adversaries has begun to outpace the acquisition
of counter-UAS effectors in Army Programs of Record. The com-
mittee remains concerned that the Army does not have a long-term
acquisition plan, nor accompanying budget resources across the Fu-
ture Years Defense Plan, to procure these capabilities at scale or
sustain them across the Army. This situation risks increasing
weapons inventory shortages and sustainment budget shortfalls for
existing systems and fails to address the growing threat in priority
theaters including U.S. Central Command.
The committee encourages the Army to leverage funding avail-
able and utilize the budget process to diversify and expand avail-
able counter-UAS systems. Therefore, the committee directs the
Secretary of the Army to submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the service’s plan to utilize exist-
ing authorities to procure combat-validated counter-UAS intercep-
tors from additional vendors over the next 5 years.
Expeditionary air base defense in support of Agile Combat
Employment
The committee recognizes the centrality of Agile Combat Employ-
ment (ACE) to the Air Force’s future operating concepts, particu-
larly in the Indo-Pacific and other contested theaters. The success
of ACE depends not only on the ability to disperse and maneuver
air assets but also on the survivability and security of expedi-
tionary air bases under persistent threat from unmanned aerial
systems (UAS), cruise missiles, and other precision strike capabili-
ties.
The committee is concerned that the Air Force currently lacks
dedicated, organic capabilities to defend forward-deployed air bases
and that expeditionary base defense remains underdeveloped as a
core service competency. While the Army is expected to provide
ground-based air defense in joint operations, the evolving character
of the threat and the operational demands of ACE require that the
Air Force assume greater responsibility for the defense of its own
forward installations.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 31, 2026, on the Department of the Air Force’s
plan to develop and institutionalize organic air base defense capa-
bilities for expeditionary operations. The briefing should include:
(1) A description of the Air Force’s efforts to establish formal re-
sponsibility for expeditionary air base defense within its organiza-
tional structure, including consideration of a dedicated office, pro-

gram executive group, or cross-functional team charged with devel-
oping and integrating relevant capabilities; (2) An overview of ef-
forts to field layered air base defense solutions such as point-de-
fense missile systems, counter-UAS platforms, electronic warfare
tools, directed energy weapons, sensors, and command and control
architectures tailored to the ACE mission set; (3) A summary of
current or planned pilot units tasked with air base defense at ACE
hubs in forward theaters, including the Indo-Pacific; (4) An over-
view of system prototypes in use, initial operational concepts, and
how these initiatives are informing future doctrine, training, and
force structure decisions; (5) An explanation of how expeditionary
air base defense is being incorporated into Air Force wargames,
campaign modeling, and force design exercises, with attention to
contested logistics, defensive mobility, and ACE-specific operational
constraints; and (6) A review of current and planned budget lines
supporting expeditionary base defense capabilities and how the Air
Force intends to prioritize and sustain these efforts across the fu-
ture years defense program.
The committee encourages the Air Force to treat expeditionary
base defense as a core enabler of ACE and to pursue innovative,
scalable, and threat-adaptive solutions. The committee expects the
Air Force to institutionalize this mission area and provide sus-
tained leadership, oversight, and resourcing to ensure the protec-
tion of forward airpower projection capabilities in contested envi-
ronments.
Experimental Operations Unit
The committee applauds the Department of the Air Force’s ef-
forts to develop doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leader-
ship, personnel, facilities, and policy concepts related to the Col-
laborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). While these efforts are crucial to
delivering the next generation of air superiority, the committee is
concerned that the Experimental Operations Unit (EOU) is dupli-
cative to work already conducted by other test organizations and
diverts critical funding, personnel, and aircraft from focused, delib-
erative, and expeditious test, evaluation, and fielding of CCA.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a report to the congressional defense committees, by not
later than February 15, 2026, on the EOU. The report should in-
clude: (1) The complete funding profile for the EOU, including the
current fiscal year and across the future years defense program, as
well as requirements for military personnel and military construc-
tion for the organization; (2) The current and projected require-
ments for manning the organization over the next 5 years, includ-
ing a breakdown of job classifications; (3) The specific aspects of
CCA operations the Air Force intends to evaluate in the EOU, in-
cluding the specific data that will be collected, how the data will
be collected, who will process the data, and when such evaluations
shall begin and conclude; (4) An explanation as to why the duties
of EOU-assigned personnel could not be performed in the course of
developmental or operational test by pre-existing developmental or
operational test organizations; (5) An explanation of how the tasks
performed by the EOU are different from testing for remotely pi-
loted aircraft and how such evaluations were accomplished for re-

motely piloted aircraft; (6) A list of impacts to developmental test,
operational test, and contractor operations by the establishment of
a third test location for the EOU; (7) A projected timeline of how
long the Air Force expects to operate the EOU; (8) A description
of the difference between experimentation versus traditional devel-
opmental and operational test as well as any difference in risk ac-
ceptance between the two processes; and (9) A recommendation as
to whether the Air Force should use the EOU for the CCA program
and, if so, an assessment of whether the Air Force should use the
EOU for other acquisitions programs.
F–15E propulsion modernization assessment
The committee remains concerned about fighter capacity and has
consistently raised issues regarding the future of U.S. air superi-
ority and the sustainability of the fighter aircraft industrial base.
While the committee continues to support procurement of addi-
tional F–15EX aircraft, it remains uncertain whether the tactical
fighter force will meet future operational needs even with pur-
chases of F–15EX and other fighter aircraft in the plan. The com-
mittee also notes that the Air Force has not yet submitted the F–
15E retirement report required by the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) and recognizes
there may be viable options to extend the F–15E’s service life.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide, by December 31, 2025, a briefing to the congressional
defense committees on the financial and operational costs and ben-
efits of modernizing the F–15E fleet, specifically the subset of the
fleet with older engines. The assessment should address the poten-
tial impact on mission capability, including propulsion system up-
grades.
F–16 electronic warfare modernization
The committee recognizes the continued importance of the F–16
to the Air Force’s tactical aviation portfolio. As adversary electronic
warfare (EW) and air defense capabilities grow more sophisticated,
legacy platforms like the F–16 must be equipped with modern sur-
vivability enhancements to remain operationally relevant in con-
tested environments.
The Air Force has been developing the Integrated Viper Elec-
tronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS), a digital, open-architecture system
intended to significantly improve the F–16’s survivability against
advanced threats. The committee supports the continued advance-
ment of IVEWS and encourages the Air Force to evaluate addi-
tional EW upgrade options to ensure the most cost-effective, capa-
ble, and sustainable solution is available to the total force.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, on the Air Force’s plan to field these
F–16 EW capabilities. The briefing should include: (1) The current
status, schedule, and performance of IVEWS development and inte-
gration; (2) A description of any other potential F–16 EW mod-
ernization efforts under consideration or in development; (3) The
strategy and criteria for fielding EW upgrades across the active
duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve F–16 fleets; (4)

Funding profiles and procurement plans across the Future Years
Defense Program; and (5) Any assessments of operational effective-
ness, cost, and risk associated with competing or complementary
EW solutions.
The committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring parity in
survivability and mission capability across the total force F–16
fleet and encourages the Department of Defense to pursue a com-
mon, interoperable solution set where feasible.
Flightline Equipment Connectivity
The committee recognizes the critical need to enhance
connectivity for flightline support equipment to enable the Air
Force’s Agile Combat Employment (ACE) strategy. The committee
is concerned that most flightline support equipment, such as gen-
erators, light carts, and support vehicles, remains unconnected,
limiting the Air Force’s ability to optimize asset tracking, health
monitoring, and power management in contested or austere envi-
ronments. This creates gaps, particularly in pre-deployed locations,
where unmonitored equipment often becomes nonmission-capable,
requiring repair or replacement, degrading readiness and under-
mining forward-operating capabilities.
While the committee supports continued investment in 5G tech-
nologies, the committee encourages the Air Force to pursue com-
plementary connectivity solutions tailored to the specific needs of
flightline support equipment—particularly for assets in austere en-
vironments, contested environments, and in long-term storage.
These solutions may include military-grade long-range communica-
tions systems, which offer key advantages, including extended
range and portability; security and independence; low power con-
sumption; and cost and deployment efficiency due to minimal infra-
structure requirements.
The committee encourages the Secretary of the Air Force to
prioritize the evaluation and integration of connectivity solutions
specifically designed for flightline support equipment and directs
the Secretary to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 31, 2026. At a minimum, this briefing shall include: (1)
A detailed assessment of current and planned initiatives to im-
prove connectivity for flightline support equipment; (2) The chal-
lenges and limitations of using existing and future support systems
in ACE scenarios, including impacts on operational security, spec-
trum management, and deployability; (3) An analysis of the feasi-
bility, scalability, and benefits of incorporating military-grade radio
systems into flightline support systems, and how these technologies
complement existing connectivity efforts; and (4) Recommendations
for integrating diverse connectivity solutions to enhance the oper-
ational readiness and resilience of flightline support equipment in
austere environments.
Future X-band radar
The committee notes that the future X-band radar (FXR) is a
planned Navy development program that is designed to replace leg-
acy mast-mounted radars on surface combatants for horizon and
surface search and track. These radars stare out to the horizon to

identify threats. The committee notes that this program is uniquely
funded through Spectrum Relocation Fund dollars, associated with
deconflicting the 3.45–3.55 Mhz S-band spectrum. With this fund-
ing available, the committee believes the Navy should move expedi-
tiously to begin fielding FXR to the fleet to counter advanced
threats. Navy inaction puts more than $11.0 billion in available
funding at risk. With a planned initial operating capability in 2035,
the Navy acquisition plan risks failing to complete procurement of
130 planned ship-sets before the Spectrum Relocation Fund expires
in 2041.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
develop a plan to accelerate the acquisition of FXR. That plan
should achieve low-rate initial production not later than January
1, 2030, and the delivery of at least 5 percent of total planned pro-
duction quantities not later than December 31, 2035. The Secretary
of the Navy is directed to report on the contents of that plan to the
congressional defense committees, not later than March 1, 2026.
Heavy Vehicle Simulator
The committee recognizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ in-
volvement in performing critical infrastructure research on roads,
bridges, airfields, and railroads. The committee notes that a critical
enabler of this mission is the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS),
which is designed to simulate a large number of vehicle passes, at
full scale, on asphalt or concrete pavement in order to safely and
quickly evaluate the effects of highway traffic on a particular pave-
ment being tested.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the U.S. Army and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue its efforts to upgrade,
test, and qualify the HVS Mark IV Program.
Industrial base capacity to support dual sixth-generation
fighter programs
The committee recognizes that both the Air Force and the Navy
are pursuing sixth-generation tactical aircraft platforms—the Air
Force through the F–47 program and the Navy through the F/A–
XX effort. While some have questioned whether the defense indus-
trial base can sustain two sixth-generation fighter programs simul-
taneously, the committee believes that recent reforms to the acqui-
sition system and targeted investments in the defense aerospace
sector have materially strengthened domestic capacity to meet this
challenge, if properly managed.
The committee urges the Department of the Navy to continue its
pursuit of the F/A–XX program as a core component of its future
carrier air wing. In doing so, the Navy should coordinate with the
Department of the Air Force while responding to the unique oper-
ational requirements of the maritime domain. The committee fur-
ther encourages the Department of Defense to ensure that acquisi-
tion strategies for both platforms prioritize programmatic stability,
realistic production planning, and retention of a robust supply
chain.

Litter basket stabilization
The committee understands that the Army is beginning to adopt
autonomous litter stabilization technology that provides precision,
reliability, and predictability for medical evacuation crews oper-
ating in complex environments. The committee believes efforts to
eliminate the need for a tagline in lift operations, and especially
medical evacuation operations, are worth the investment as oper-
ations are improved and risk is reduced to personnel and aircraft.
The committee notes the interest from the Army National Guard
for these capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on Army efforts to procure and employ this capability that en-
ables hoist operations without the need of a tagline.
Marine Corps Arctic capabilities
The committee recognizes the growing importance of Arctic capa-
bilities for our military, especially as commerce and competition in-
crease in the region. This is underscored by China’s ambitions to
be a ‘‘near-Arctic nation’’ and Russia’s continued attempts to ex-
ploit the region for its own strategic gain. The committee further
believes that the U.S. military is currently ill-equipped and under-
trained for Arctic conditions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy, in
consultation with the Commandant of the Marine Corps, to provide
a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than February 26, 2026, de-
tailing a proposed glidepath to train and fully equip a regimental-
sized element within 3 years of the report’s submission. The glide-
path shall include at a minimum: (1) Resourcing requirements to
provide the unit with military equipment and clothing that enables
fighting in Arctic environments as part of the unit’s permanently
assigned equipment set; (2) Resourcing requirements to support an-
nual training in seasonal cold weather environments for all or part
of the unit that prioritizes training opportunities in support of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command.
MH–139 Grey Wolf procurement
The committee recognizes that the Air Force has been procuring
the MH–139 Grey Wolf helicopter to modernize its aging fleet of
UH–1 helicopters. However, the committee believes that the deci-
sion to truncate the MH–139 program before acquiring enough air-
craft to fully replace the UH–1 fleet raises significant concerns.
The committee believes that restoring procurement to the origi-
nal plan of 84 aircraft is necessary to meet mission requirements
for security, missile field transport, and very important person op-
erations. The committee does not believe that continuing to operate
some portion of the UH–1 fleet makes economic sense or is advis-
able from the standpoint of safety.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Air Force to notify the
congressional defense committees within 30 days of identifying any
anticipated delays in the delivery of MH–139 aircraft. This notifica-

tion should include a written explanation detailing the reasons for
the delay.
Military aircraft engine industrial base
The committee recognizes that maintaining a skilled engineering
and design workforce within the military aircraft engine industrial
base is essential to national security. To that end, the U.S. Govern-
ment has made significant investments in next-generation military
engine technologies over the past decade. However, the absence of
a comprehensive strategy for transitioning these innovations into
developmental and in-production aircraft platforms remains a crit-
ical gap. These advancements, while promising, are not being field-
ed at the pace necessary to maintain U.S. superiority, particularly
as foreign adversaries continue to make measurable gains in en-
gine performance and reliability.
Additionally, the committee notes that ongoing aircraft develop-
ment programs across military departments are progressing largely
in isolation, without unified guidance or coordination. This frag-
mented approach undermines efforts to build a resilient, competi-
tive, and effective engine industrial base that supports both current
and future manned and unmanned aircraft programs. As the De-
partment of Defense increases its focus on strengthening the U.S.
industrial and manufacturing base, it is imperative to provide the
domestic military aircraft engine sector with a clearer, more coher-
ent path from innovation to integration. This includes aligning
technology maturation, production readiness, and platform adop-
tion timelines.
The committee believes that the Air Force’s Next Generation
Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program represents a notable effort to
develop and reduce risk for adaptive engine prototypes to support
the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) family of systems, in-
cluding F–47 and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), as well as
joint requirements like F/A–XX. While NGAP is designed to oper-
ate independently of NGAD’s broader development timeline, it re-
mains critical that this initiative be viewed within the larger con-
text of a strategic engine industrial base framework.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, that would outline the current state
and future trajectory of the U.S. military aircraft engine industrial
base, with a particular focus on: (1) Workforce sustainability and
advanced manufacturing readiness; (2) Integration of next-genera-
tion engine technologies into current and future platforms; (3)
Inter-service coordination and strategic guidance for engine devel-
opment; (4) Industrial base capacity and competitiveness; (5) Align-
ment of the NGAP program within broader Department objectives;
and (6) A roadmap for fielding sixth-generation propulsion tech-
nologies.
This briefing will inform congressional oversight and support the
continued technological superiority and industrial resilience of the
U.S. military aircraft engine sector.

Modular munitions for small unmanned aerial systems
The Secretary of Defense has stated that the Department of De-
fense will prioritize the adoption and integration of drone tech-
nology in the military. The role that drones and small, unmanned
aerial systems (sUAS) will play in future warfare is evident in
these systems’ use in Ukraine. As part of the broader adoption of
drones, the committee believes it is important that payloads on
these sUAS vehicles be able to integrate with various types of
sUAS for a variety of missions, from clearing minefields to strategic
target prosecution.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, on any plans to pro-
cure modular munitions that can be adopted for the different types
of autonomous systems that the Department plans to widely field
in the coming years. The briefing shall include: (1) Potential cost
savings for the Department that modular munitions can provide;
(2) The Department’s plan for payloads on autonomous systems; (3)
How such procurement relates to the Department’s strategies for
distributed operations; and (4) The contribution that the Depart-
ment expects of autonomous systems in carrying out distributed op-
erations.
MQ–9 Replacement
The committee is concerned that current attrition rates for the
MQ–9 platform will leave the Air Force unable to meet warfighter
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) requirements
that cannot be fulfilled by space-based capabilities. The committee
believes that planning for a capable airborne successor to the MQ–
9 must be a key element of the Air Force’s broader ISR strategy,
required elsewhere in this Act.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to prepare an analysis of the feasibility of developing and deploying
an airborne alternative to the MQ–9 and provide a briefing on this
analysis to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than December 31, 2025.
This analysis should consider options for a dedicated MQ–9 re-
placement or a next-generation medium-altitude unmanned aerial
system capable of performing, at a minimum, the missions cur-
rently conducted by the MQ–9 and deployable at a comparable
scale.
Munitions Handling Unit lift modernization
The committee is aware that capital investment in new pieces of
ground support equipment (GSE) has been limited, leading to a sit-
uation where, after over 50 years of operation, sustainment and
readiness are now critical capability shortfall risks across the GSE
fleet. The committee notes that the Munitions Handling Unit–83
(MHU–83) is an essential munitions trailer, used primarily for
loading ordnance in the 3000–7000lb range. The MHU–83 is used
for loading both nuclear and conventional weapons on U.S. Air
Force Strategic Bombers and heavy ordnance for strike aircraft and
U.S. Navy P–8s. The committee understands that modernization ef-
forts to the MHU–83 have been requested by operators for years,
as the legacy MHU–83 has faced readiness and operational issues

and has caused airmen to be hospitalized due to exhaust inhalation
during extended loading operations.
Therefore, given the importance of the MHU–83, the committee
directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a one-time briefing
to the congressional defense committees, not later than March 31,
2026, on efforts to modernize the MHU–83 for conventional and
strategic munitions.
Navy actions on Government Accountability Office rec-
ommendations
The committee notes that the Comptroller General of the United
States has produced several reports over the last 10 years that
have included 90 specific recommendations to help the Navy im-
prove its management of the shipbuilding portfolio. The committee
understands that the Navy has only implemented, to a greater or
lesser extent, some 30 of these recommendations. As part of a larg-
er effort to improve the quality and timeliness of the Navy’s ship-
building enterprise, the committee needs to understand why the
Navy has chosen not to implement the other Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) recommendations.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than May 1, 2026, on the 90 recommendations the GAO has made
since 2015 to improve Navy shipbuilding. The report should: (1)
Identify actions the Navy has taken in response to recommenda-
tions that have been implemented, including an assessment of
whether the recommendations had a positive impact on Navy ship-
building; (2) Identify actions the Navy has taken in response to rec-
ommendations that have been partially implemented, explain why
those recommendations were only partially implemented, and iden-
tify what gaps in authorities or resources have prevented full im-
plementation; and (3) Identify GAO recommendations on which the
Navy has taken no action, including an explanation for why given
recommendations have not been followed and whether gaps in au-
thorities or resources have prevented adoption of the GAO rec-
ommendation.
Next generation mobility requirements
The committee recognizes the critical importance of modernizing
the Air Force’s mobility enterprise to ensure the Joint Force retains
the ability to project and sustain combat power in contested and
degraded operational environments. In particular, the committee
supports ongoing efforts to develop next-generation strategic and
intra-theater airlift, aerial refueling, and distinguished visitor air-
lift capabilities that are survivable, agile, and aligned with future
operational concepts such as Agile Combat Employment and inte-
grated with the Air Force’s force design.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31,
2026, on the status of: (1) A next-generation strategic airlift pro-
gram, including efforts to define requirements, operational con-
cepts, and acquisition strategies to replace or augment existing
strategic airlift aircraft; (2) A next-generation tactical airlift pro-

gram, including defining platform characteristics, projected mission
sets, and describing how the capability will support distributed op-
erations in contested environments; (3) The Next Generation Aerial
Support System program for satisfying aerial refueling require-
ments, including survivability requirements, integration with fu-
ture airframes, and concepts for operations in denied or degraded
threat environments; (4) A program for distinguished visitor airlift
recapitalization, including modernization needs, mission require-
ments, and alignment with broader mobility force structure plan-
ning; (5) Cross-service coordination and integration with allied and
partner capabilities; (6) Alignment with the Department of De-
fense’s force design and posture planning; and (7) Any anticipated
challenges or decision points in the coming fiscal years.
The committee also encourages the Air Force to explore the po-
tential applicability of emerging commercial technologies, including
supersonic platforms, alternative propulsion systems, and innova-
tive airframe designs, that may offer improvements in speed, effi-
ciency, and survivability for future mobility missions.
Next generation night vision devices
The committee recognizes the importance of the goal of the Inte-
grated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) program to enhance
warfighter situational awareness, lethality, and operational effec-
tiveness. However, the committee is concerned about the delays in
the Army’s ability to acquire an optimized system that meets sol-
dier requirements. With the increased competitiveness in the ad-
vanced night vision capabilities environment, the committee en-
courages the U.S. Army to expeditiously pursue its next generation
night vision devices. Further, the committee encourages the Army
to prioritize the selection of a night vision solution that is cost-effi-
cient; that is designed with durability, modularity, and lightweight
construction; and that has the ability to rapidly iterate to address
soldier-identified improvements or expansions of capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on its ‘‘Own the Night Strategy’’ and its efforts to opti-
mize investment in advanced night vision capabilities.
Next Generation Squad Weapon magazine development test-
ing
The committee recognizes the importance of rapidly developing
and acquiring commercial components that reduce soldier load and
improve reliability. Magazine selection is critical as it directly im-
pacts weapon performance and soldier safety, with historical test-
ing showing significant performance variations between designs.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
review the Next Generation Squad Weapon magazine qualification
testing and reliability process to ensure that there were trans-
parent and timely opportunities for commercial, off-the-shelf sup-
plied components, specifically magazines, to compete fairly. Addi-
tionally, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to review
whether proper contracting practices were instituted. Finally, the
committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a briefing,

not later than February 20, 2026, to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, detailing
the findings from these reviews.
Organic Industrial Base artillery ammunition moderniza-
tion
The committee is concerned that the Army needs to increase its
investment in organic ammunition plant manufacturing safety and
readiness projects to meet current and future requirements. The
committee understands that adding a new production line, based
upon designs for the Universal Artillery Production Line, to the or-
ganic industrial base would provide the Army additional resilience
and surge capacity to meet demand across a range of artillery pro-
duction, particularly for metal components.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on the progress of modernization funding across am-
munition plants.
Precision artillery munition modernization
The committee understands that capabilities currently exist that
would enable the Army to integrate Global Positioning System
(GPS)-resilient hardware and software into the Excalibur incre-
ment 1b and other precision artillery munitions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on the Army’s assessment of technical options available to en-
hance the performance of the munition in a GPS-denied environ-
ment, including the technical feasibility and operational utility of
incorporating Global Positioning System (GPS)-resilient hardware
and software into current munitions to improve and expand capa-
bility.
Preservation of World War II-era Aircraft in Air Force His-
toric Collection
The committee recognizes the profound contributions of Amer-
ican airmen during World War II and the lasting importance of
preserving the aircraft they flew. As the number of surviving vet-
erans of that conflict continues to decline, the aircraft that remain
in the Department of the Air Force’s historic collection serve as
tangible, irreplaceable links to a defining era in American and
world history.
The committee emphasizes that these aircraft are national assets
and must be treated with the respect appropriate to their historical
value. These aircraft are not only critical to honoring those who
served but also to inspiring future generations with the legacy of
service and sacrifice.
The committee is concerned that many of these historically sig-
nificant aircraft, particularly those produced prior to December 31,
1945, are currently housed on external display and are at increas-
ing risk of irreversible degradation due to environmental exposure.
Without urgent action to relocate these aircraft into indoor, cli-

mate-controlled environments, their long-term preservation may no
longer be viable.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing, not later than December 31, 2025, to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on the Department of the Air Force’s plan to relo-
cate, preserve, and sustain its World War II-era aircraft currently
on external display. The briefing should address the following: (1)
A plan to initiate the phased relocation of historic aircraft produced
prior to December 31, 1945, from external to indoor display facili-
ties, with prioritization given to B–17s, B–18s, B–24s, B–25s, B–
29s, A–26s, P–38s, P–47s, P–51s, C–46s, and C–47s; (2) A proposed
prioritization framework for relocation, favoring institutions such
as the National Museum of the United States Air Force
(NMUSAF), the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum,
NMUSAF-affiliated partner museums, other Department of De-
fense service museums, and national air museums of allied and
partner nations; (3) A plan for modifying or superseding existing
loan agreements that only permit external display, in order to favor
applicants with: (a) indoor, climate-controlled display capabilities;
(b) demonstrated ability to conduct historical restoration and pres-
ervation; and (c) public access commitments; (4) An assessment of
opportunities for artifact trades to enhance the NMUSAF collection
or broader Department of the Air Force heritage efforts; (5) A long-
term framework for the de-accessioning of at-risk aircraft that can-
not be preserved under these conditions within 5 years, including
authority to: (a) offer such aircraft for sale with proceeds directed
to NMUSAF activities; (b) transfer aircraft on an as-is, where-is
basis, with no cost or guarantee of condition to the Department of
the Air Force; and (c) remove end-use restrictions from de-
accessioned assets; (6) A reaffirmation that no aircraft produced
prior to December 31, 1945, may be destroyed, scrapped, or other-
wise damaged by the Department of the Air Force; and (7) A proc-
ess for granting waivers for continued external display where envi-
ronmental conditions, such as those in arid regions, significantly
reduce the risk of corrosion and physical decay.
The committee intends to closely monitor the Department of the
Air Force’s stewardship of these artifacts to ensure their preserva-
tion for future generations.
Propellant industrial base expansion
The committee understands the defense industrial base currently
lacks sufficient surge capacity for energetic material production, in-
cluding propellants that are required across a broad spectrum of
critical munitions programs. The committee is aware that the cur-
rent energetic industrial base consists of multiple single points of
failure that would limit the Department of Defense’s ability to
surge propellant production in moments of crisis, specifically dur-
ing large-scale combat operations against a peer competitor. Fur-
ther, the committee notes that section 114 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) required a report on
the procurement of energetic materials from sources outside the
United States and expressed the need to strengthen and expand

domestic production capacity of energetic materials, including pro-
pellants.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a one-time report to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 1, 2026, on the advisability and feasibility of
expanding domestic propellant production capacity to increase re-
siliency within the defense industrial base. The report should be
unclassified and may include a classified annex if necessary. At a
minimum, the report should include: (1) An analysis of current de-
fense organic industrial base (OIB) propellant production capacity,
including the capability to surge production; (2) A review of current
and expected propellant requirements across the military services;
(3) An analysis of the Department’s OIB, specifically the U.S.
Army’s OIB, which identifies installations that could support addi-
tional propellant manufacturing activities; and (4) An assessment
of estimated financial costs associated with expanding propellant
production at the aforementioned U.S. Army OIB installations, in-
cluding the potential of public-private partnerships.
Rapid fielding of commercial command and control oper-
ating systems
The committee recognizes that the deployment of integrated com-
mand and control operating systems that leverage proven commer-
cial technologies has demonstrated significant operational success
in enhancing command and control capabilities, situational aware-
ness, targeting, and decision-making effectiveness for the
warfighter.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than February 16,
2026, on: (1) Efforts to field commercial command and control oper-
ating systems to the military departments, the Office of the Sec-
retary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the Missile Defense Agency;
(2) Plans for the integration or retirement of existing data plat-
forms and command and control systems; (3) Metrics for evaluating
mission impact, data interoperability, and operational readiness;
and (4) Any other matters the Secretary considers appropriate.
Report on critical suppliers registry
The committee notes that section 844 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law
115–232) requires the Secretary of Defense to administer a process
to analyze and assess potential items for consideration to be re-
quired to be procured from a manufacturer that is part of the na-
tional technology and industrial base (NTIB). Despite multiple re-
quests, the committee has not received information regarding
progress toward the establishment of the required process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than December 1, 2025, providing an update on the implementa-
tion of this requirement. The report shall include, at a minimum,
a description of: (1) How the Department of Defense has imple-
mented the program; (2) The Department’s designated official re-
sponsible for administration; (3) The process for an organization to

to be procured from a manufacturer that is part of the NTIB; (4)
The number of components or organizations that have applied; (5)
The number and list of components that have been approved; and
(6) Recommendations for facilitating accessibility for applications
from suppliers.
Requirements related to Navy amphibious warfare ships
The committee notes that in the last several years, the Marine
Corps has not been able to sustain the 3.0 Marine Expeditionary
Unit (MEU) presence because only 13 or 14 of the Navy’s fleet of
31 amphibious ships are available at any one time due to mainte-
nance challenges. The committee believes the Department of De-
fense should define the requirement for MEU presence and pro-
gram the resources to achieve that requirement by providing suffi-
cient ships, repair and maintenance of those ships, and manning
of those ships.
Therefore, the committee directs the Vice Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to conduct an analysis to determine the requirement
for MEU presence and to report the results of that analysis to the
congressional defense committees, not later than May 1, 2026.
The committee believes that the Navy, as it executes the ship-
building program to achieve those requirements, should purchase
amphibious ships using multi-ship procurement authorities.
The committee also directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide
a report, not later than May 1, 2026, that formally responds to the
recommendations in the Government Accountability Office report
published on December 4, 2024, titled ‘‘Amphibious Warfare Fleet:
Navy Needs to Complete Key Efforts to Better Ensure Ships Are
Available for Marines’’’ (GAO–25–106728), which concluded that
the Navy needs to complete key efforts to better ensure ships are
available for marines to conduct Marine Corps missions, such as
amphibious assault and humanitarian response.
Secondary sources in the munitions supply chain
The committee recognizes the critical importance of our arsenals,
depots, and ammunition plants for our national defense. The provi-
sion included in section 334 of the Servicemember Quality of Life
Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) required a plan for secondary
sources in the munitions supply chain.
The committee remains focused on this issue and urges the De-
partment of Defense to expedite the briefing and subsequent plan,
which is already past its original due date of June 23, 2025, as it
will help inform the committee on potential future legislative ac-
tions.
Squad Designated Marksman Rifle
The committee is aware that U.S. Special Operations Command
(SOCOM) has procured and fielded the Mid-Range Gas Gun Sniper
(MRGG–S) platform that has proven to be highly accurate and reli-
able. The committee is also aware that the M110 Squad Designated
Marksman Rifle (SDMR) that is used extensively throughout the
Army is coming to the end of its service life. The M110 SDMR is

chambered in the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge, and the Army is in
the process of transitioning to a new 6.8x51mm cartridge. The com-
mittee is aware that MRGG–S upper receivers have been developed
and chambered in 6.8x51mm and that those upper receiver groups
are compatible with the lower receiver of the M110 SDMR.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 20, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on the advisability and feasibility of a service life ex-
tension program for the M110 SDMR that incorporates the

Section 4:
6.8x51mm upper receiver group.
Status of B–52 TF33 engine generators
The committee notes that the B–52H Stratofortress is under-
going a program to replace its original TF33 engines, which are
now in diminishing supply and are a critical asset to airplane
availability. The committee further notes that the TF33 engines
are paired with one generator for every two engines to provide 125
kilovolt-amperes (kVA) each. Until such time as the replacement
engine and generator set under the Commercial Engine Replace-
ment Program become available, the B52–H will rely on the exist-
ing TF33 engine and generator. The committee recognizes that ef-
forts are underway to extend the life of TF33 engine. However, it
is unaware of any effort to maintain a supply of 125-kVA genera-
tors to power the engine.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to brief the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, but not later than March 31, 2026, on the current sup-
ply of TF33 engines and generators and any effects the limited gen-
erator supply may be having on the availability of the existing fleet
of B–52H planes. Further, the briefing shall include what effort
will be made to ensure that sufficient generators are available until
the Commercial Engine Replacement Program can provide both
new engines and generators as required for the B–52H mission.
Supporting new entrants and modern approaches to ad-
dress missile inventory
The committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense’s projected inventory of precision-guided munitions is insuffi-
cient to deter or prevail in a conflict with a near-peer adversary.
The committee notes that the current industrial base lacks the ca-
pacity to surge production of affordable weapons systems to fulfill
the quantity demanded within the timeframe required to deter or
win a conflict.
The committee is encouraged by the establishment of the Enter-
prise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, a recent collaboration between
the Air Force Armament Directorate and the Defense Innovation
Unit. The ETV program is prioritizing partnerships with manufac-
turers new to the defense industrial base, using innovative proc-
esses and commercial, off-the-shelf components to enable high-
speed production at scale to meet surges in demand.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than January 31, 2026,

on plans to enter into production contracts with new market en-
trants that employ innovative and cost-effective processes, includ-
ing digital engineering, additive manufacturing, and minimization
of parts counts and supply chain dependencies. This briefing should
also include an assessment of how these manufacturing techniques
can be utilized by other programs of record in the production of ad-
vanced, multi-mission air vehicles.
Tactical ground radars
The committee supports the Air Force’s efforts to field new tac-
tical ground radars capable of detecting a broad range of threats,
from small unmanned aerial systems to hypersonic and missile sys-
tems, as part of a mid-range layered defense. The committee also
recognizes the TPS–75 radar has faced sustainment and mod-
ernization issues. While the Air Force plans to replace it with the
Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar TPY–4 radar,
currently under development, the early retirement of TPS–75 sys-
tems still raises concerns. Delays in TPY–4 fielding, or failure to
meet operational requirements, could create a significant capability
gap, especially as evolving threats demand greater mobility, auton-
omy, networking, and resilience.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026. This briefing shall include: (1) Status
of TPY–4 development; (2) Funds expended to date and required to
complete development of the TPY–4; (3) TPY–4 fielding timeline
and quantity; (4) TPS–75 inventory and mission capability rates
(full and partial); (5) Number of TPS–75 systems needed to prevent
capability gaps; and (6) Efforts to sustain and upgrade the TPS–
75 until full TPY–4 deployment.
UH–60M Black Hawk modernization
The committee notes that in February 2024, the Army an-
nounced its Aviation Rebalance Initiative to reallocate its aviation
modernization investments across new and enduring platforms to
meet emerging capability requirements in a resource constrained
environment. As part of that announcement, the Army committed
to pursuing a new Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) contract starting
in fiscal year 2027 for new UH–60M Black Hawk aircraft when the
current MYP is completed at the end of fiscal year 2026. This new
MYP is needed to ensure adequate inventories of UH–60M heli-
copters for the active Army and the Army National Guard (ARNG),
given the Army’s decision to cancel the UH–60V modification pro-
gram. Even as the Army develops the Future Long Range Assault
Aircraft, the Army has stated that the UH–60M will remain a large
part of the Army’s active and ARNG aviation fleet for decades to
come.
The committee endorses the Army’s efforts to continue to procure
and modernize the UH–60M Black Hawk as part of the future
aviation force. The committee supports Army efforts to prepare for
a fiscal year 2027 MYP, including any long lead or advance pro-
curement actions that can be taken to streamline schedules, main-
tain the supplier base, and secure key components to ensure timely
deliveries.

Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than September 30, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, on measures the Army is taking to support a new
MYP for the UH–60M Black Hawk, including the number of air-
craft to be included in the new MYP, delivery schedules, and con-
tracting in advance for key components and subsystems. The brief-
ing should also include an assessment of the total UH–60M re-
quirement for the active and ARNG aviation fleet in light of the
cancellation of the UH–60V modification program.
Ultra-Lightweight Camouflage Net System
The committee continues to be concerned by the Army’s inability
to centrally fund basic camouflage and concealment for the
warfighter. This has resulted in rotational forces deploying with
30-year-old camouflage technology that is unable to defeat modern
sensor threats. The committee notes that soldiers believe they are
protected and concealed by their camouflage when, in fact, they are
more vulnerable than ever to threat sensors and lethal loitering
munitions. The committee believes that camouflage is inherent to
Army doctrine and, as such, should be procured with strategic in-
tent, and not ad hoc, as unit funding allows.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 20, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on the Army’s evaluation of the Ultra-Lightweight
Camouflage Net System for classification as a minimum mission
essential wartime requirement.
Urgent deployment of commercial counter unmanned aerial
systems capabilities for installation protection
The committee is concerned that the military services are not
acting with sufficient urgency to address the growing threat posed
by small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) to Department of De-
fense installations and critical infrastructure. While comprehen-
sive, integrated counter-UAS (cUAS) architectures may be nec-
essary in the long term, the committee is frustrated by the contin-
ued reliance on plodding, service-driven research and requirements
development processes at the expense of near-term protection.
The recent Ukrainian Operation Spiderweb—a coordinated, long-
range drone campaign that struck five Russian airbases deep in-
side sovereign territory—highlights the increasing sophistication,
range, and tactical impact of low-cost, commercially available drone
platforms. The operation demonstrates how peer adversaries or
non-state actors could exploit similar capabilities to threaten U.S.
military installations.
The committee urges the military departments to move aggres-
sively to leverage the growing ecosystem of commercially available
cUAS systems—some of which are already deployed by special op-
erations forces, other federal agencies, and critical infrastructure
operators—to immediately improve protection of high-value mili-
tary facilities. The threat is real, present, and escalating.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than February 1, 2026, to provide a briefing to the Commit-

TITLE II—RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST,
AND EVALUATION
Subtitle A—Authorization of Appropriations
Sec. 201—Authorization of appropriations
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize ap-
propriations for research, development, test, and evaluation activi-
ties at the levels identified in section 4201 of division D of this Act.
Subtitle B—Program Requirements, Restrictions, and
Limitations
Sec. 211—Modifications to defense research capacity build-
ing program
The committee recommends a provision that would require sepa-
rate funding solicitations each focused toward Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Tribal Colleges and Universities
(TCUs), and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI).
The committee notes that currently the Department of Defense’s
program for funding research at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs lumps
funding opportunities together, with no ability to tailor the solicita-
tion to the preferred institution type. Because of the disparities in
size and comprehensiveness of the institutions’ research programs,
the committee believes that having some ability to target and scale
programs based on the outcome desired by the government would
be a useful tool for the Department. The committee believes that
differentiating funding opportunities will allow the Department to
continue to foster and grow the nascent research capabilities of
HBCUs and TCUs while not forcing them to compete directly with
the more established research capabilities of MSIs. The committee
encourages the Department to use this authority strategically in
order both to meet its strategic research goals and to expand and
grow the Department’s overall research capacity to support U.S.
national and economic security goals.
Sec. 212—Program for the enhancement of the research, de-
velopment, test, and evaluation centers of the Depart-
ment of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 305 of title 10, United States Code, by adding a new section,
4145, and codify the authority from section 233 of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328),
which allows eligible centers in the Department of Defense re-
search, development, test and evaluation enterprise to waive cer-
tain policies or regulations if the waiver is demonstrated to in-
crease the efficiency and effectiveness of such organizations and is

the Department of Defense.
Sec. 213—Extension of authority for assignment to Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency of private sector
personnel with critical research and development exper-
tise
1The committee recommends a provision that would ex-
tend the pilot authority of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency to temporarily assign employees from the
private sector with skills, background, or expertise in crit-
ical technology areas to work for the Agency until Sep-
tember 30, 2030.
Sec. 214—Limitation on use of funds for certain Navy soft-
ware
The committee recommends a provision that would limit funding
for the Navy’s Autonomy Baseline Manager and Common Control
System software until the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of
Naval Operations submit program schedule and cost information to
the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 215—Limitation on availability of funds for Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Research and Engineering
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 travel funds for the Office
of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering
until the date on which the Under Secretary of Defense for Re-
search and Engineering submits to the congressional defense com-
mittees the report required by section 245(d) of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
Sec. 216—Prohibition on contracts between certain foreign
entities and institutions of higher education conducting
Department of Defense-funded research
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit, be-
ginning on January 1, 2027, any institution of higher education
that conducts research funded by the Department of Defense from
entering into a contract with a covered nation as defined by section
4872(d) of title 10, United States Code, or a foreign entity of con-
cern as recorded on one of the defined lists in the underlying provi-
sion.

to PE 66005F, Digital Transformation Office, of $15.0 million for
the development of an adaptive threat modeling lab to support
operational experimentation of surveillance and counter-surveil-
lance systems in threat representative environments.
The committee is aware that military operations are increasingly
at risk from ubiquitous technical surveillance, which leverages per-
vasive collection of digital data from internet of things (IoT) and
other sensing devices coupled with powerful artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML) tools that allow for greater anal-
ysis and correlation of this extensive digital footprint in ways that
can uncover and compromise military operations. The committee
believes that the military should leverage evolving commercial off-
the-shelf technologies with underpinning AI and ML analytics to
analyze realistic scenarios by establishing a flexible, simulated lab
environment for demonstration, analysis, and operational training.

identify and evaluate systems or tools produced by foreign allied
nations that could be rigorously tested to determine if they could
meet specific military requirements. The committee believes this is
a cost-effective tool to quickly identify capabilities that can be
adopted by the military without lengthy developmental processes.
In addition, FCT helps strengthen the web of defense relationships
with partners by providing opportunities for them to get appro-
priate capabilities into the U.S. acquisition systems. The committee
encourages the Department of Defense to use the additional fund-
ing authorized by this Act to examine foreign-developed artificial
intelligence and machine learning capabilities, including hardware
and network processing capabilities, to assess the benefits of inte-
grating such systems into the overall networking architecture of
the Department.

gram, which helps build and expand the national innovation base
for research and education by funding research activities in science
and engineering areas responsive to the needs of national defense.
Participation in this program is limited to states that meet eligi-
bility criteria as outlined in the authorizing language from previous
National Defense Authorization Acts. The program is intended to
increase the number of university researchers and improve the ca-
pabilities of institutions of higher education in eligible jurisdictions
to perform competitive research relevant to the Department of De-
fense (DOD). The committee also views DEPSCoR as a component
in any effort by the DOD to identify, shape, and foster innovation
ecosystems that support DOD research and technology needs.
Along with other funding programs and authorities available to the
Department, DEPSCoR should be considered as a means to expand
and diversify the innovation ecosystem for the DOD.

Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-wide, there is an in-
crease to PE 61228D8Z, Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities/Minority Institutions, of $10.0 million for additional research
in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm development using novel lin-
guistics frameworks.
The committee is aware of opportunities to develop a research
program to investigate the cognitive structural complexity and the
unique linguistics frameworks embedded within indigenous lan-
guages to support development of new and novel AI large language
models. Additionally, the committee notes that these linguistic sys-
tems could be used for developing diverse AI linguistic models that
enable more resilient, more computationally efficient, and more se-
cure AI algorithmic architectures.
Items of Special Interest

demonstrate ground launch of the AGM–158 LRASM, the FAMM
missile, and other nascent weapons.
Advanced Group 1 small unmanned aerial systems
The committee recognizes the role that ultra-lightweight Group
1 small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) can play in supporting
special operations forces (SOF) activities around the world. The
committee believes that SOF units could benefit from ultra-light
Group 1 sUAS that provide secure, modular, and rapidly
deployable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabili-
ties to support intelligence gathering, targeting, and force protec-
tion in contested and denied environments, including through the
employment of light detection and ranging, electro-optical/infrared,
and multi-spectral imaging capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the U.S. Special Oper-
ations Command to seek opportunities to procure and conduct oper-
ational testing of ultra-light Group 1 sUAS capabilities that pro-
vide such aforementioned capabilities, as appropriate.
Biometric collection and analysis
The committee is aware of efforts by U.S. Special Operations
Command (SOCOM) to develop scalable biometric collection and
analysis systems and the use of Partnership Intermediary Agree-
ments to identify relevant and commercially viable, small business-
developed technologies. The committee recognizes the utility of
next-generation biometric collection capabilities that utilize
contactless collection and artificial intelligence-powered analytics
for accelerating the identification of threats, including those posed
by international violent extremists, transnational criminal organi-
zations, and malign foreign actors.
Furthermore, the committee notes that advances in mobile soft-
ware and sensors can enable end-users to adopt, integrate, and
scale new technologies much more cost-effectively. The committee
also recognizes the potential value across a broad range of national
security applications beyond special operations where the avail-
ability of near real-time biometric information on mobile devices
and the ability to utilize software can enable more timely decision-
making. Therefore, the committee encourages continued develop-
ment and enhancement of mobile biometrics software by SOCOM
as appropriate.

made strides in injury prevention and performance optimization,
critical gaps remain in understanding the biomechanical, physio-
logical, and psychological factors that influence warfighter
lethality, survivability, and longevity in service. Addressing these
gaps is essential for ensuring force readiness and sustaining oper-
ational effectiveness across all domains of warfare.
In its efforts to sustain warfighter readiness and progress toward
total force optimization, the U.S. Armed Forces must leverage ad-
vancements in science and technology to maximize warfighter oper-
ational effectiveness and reduce injury risks. Therefore, the com-
mittee urges the Department of Defense to support additional re-
search and development focused on optimizing warfighter perform-
ance, including biomechanical, physiological, and psychological re-
search to mitigate injury risks, improve physical resilience, and
maximize readiness, survivability, and lethality in combat oper-
ations.

nected students; and encourage the program to leverage, where fea-
sible, the capacities of not-for-profits and educational institutions
as they support JROTC and other programs serving military-con-
nected students.
The committee urges the Department of Defense to submit the
report as soon as possible.
Low-cost hypersonic testing
The committee remains concerned with the lack of progress by
the Department of Defense in developing capabilities for hypersonic
weapons, as well as the technology and systems needed to counter
or defeat such weapons. The committee notes the work of the
Comptroller General of the United States in the report published
on July 29, 2024, titled ‘‘DOD Could Reduce Cost and Schedule
Risks by Following Leading Practices’’ (GAO–24–106792). The com-
mittee notes that the Comptroller General recommended the De-
partment utilize ‘‘Digital Twinning’’ to reduce cost and schedule
risks.
The committee is aware that such digital twin technology re-
quires verified computational simulations for hypersonics, which in
turn have reduced maturity and accuracy when detailed flight test
data is absent. The committee applauds the Department for initi-
ating the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed
program as a means to increase the pace and scale of hypersonic
testing, producing more of the necessary flight test data needed to
increase the fidelity overall for modeling and simulation tech-
nologies, including for digital twins. Therefore, the committee en-
courages the Department to continue to seek out low-cost
hypersonic testing opportunities to validate these models.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Research and Engineering to develop a plan to utilize dig-
ital twin technology in hypersonic design and to evaluate and as-
sess the defense industrial base’s capability and capacity to support

digital twinning for hypersonics capability development and oper-
ational simulation. The committee directs the Under Secretary to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than January 31, 2026, on the following: (1) The Depart-
ment’s plan to incorporate digital twins for advancing hypersonic
design and fielding; (2) Current digital twin models utilized by the
Department; (3) The Department’s investments in obtaining accu-
rate hypersonic flight test data; (4) An assessment of the defense
industrial base’s ability to build accurate digital twins for
hypersonic system design; and (5) The Department’s plan to utilize
the three components of hypersonic design: analytical and computa-
tional models, flight testing, and ground testing.
Navy Modular Missile Solid Rocket Motors
The committee believes that the Navy Modular Missile (NMM)
program is a critical opportunity for the Navy to establish a strong
foundation for developing and maturing future weapons systems.
The committee encourages the Navy to develop and produce the
NMM in a manner consistent with the Secretary of Defense’s com-
mitment to Congress to ‘‘leverage market forces to prioritize com-
petition and maximize innovation and efficient production.’’ Be-
cause the NMM program contemplates a common weapon system
with different solid rocket motors (SRM) for different missions, the
Navy has an opportunity to leverage an expanding SRM industrial
base effectively to support large-scale production of the NMM.
The committee recognizes that programs with multiple qualified
sub-tier suppliers are adaptable and resilient. Programs with mul-
tiple qualified SRM providers can take advantage of competition,
minimize the impacts of supply chain disruptions, scale production
efficiently, and respond to dynamic warfighting needs.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy, in
consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Sustainment, to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than December 1, 2025, on a plan to invest in qualifying
at least two domestic SRM manufacturers for each configuration of
the NMM. The briefing should address how this investment will be
incorporated in the NMM acquisition strategy to accomplish these
policy objectives. The briefing should be unclassified without dis-
semination restrictions but may contain a classified or restricted
annex.
Next-generation printed circuit boards
The committee is aware that the Department of Defense (DOD)
lacks reliable, domestic sources of supply for printed circuit boards
(PCBs), which are critical components underpinning the electronics
that power all of our weapons systems. Numerous studies by the
DOD and other agencies have documented the critical need to
strengthen domestic PCB and printed circuit board assembly man-
ufacturing to ensure a secure and reliable supply chain of these
critical technology components. The Department has also recog-
nized the importance of domestic sources of these vital parts, with
individual awards under the Defense Production Act of 1950 (Pub-
lic Law 81–774) to try to stimulate investment in the manufacture

of these technologies. Further, the committee notes that the Execu-
tive Agent for Printed Circuit Board and Interconnect Technology
was established in section 256 of the Duncan Hunter National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110–417)
to ensure both a secure supply of PCBs, as well as to maintain
deep technical understanding of the technology to help inform the
Department.
The committee is also aware that the Department has leveraged
the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) to support some capacity ex-
pansion for manufacturing of next generation PCBs. Next genera-
tion PCBs are needed not only to increase the supply chain security
of such technology, but also to take advantage of advances in need-
ed technology to modernize the substrates and manufacturing proc-
essing for PCBs to incorporate changes like the incorporation of
new materials, optical interconnects, and 3D heterogenous integra-
tion. The committee believes an opportunity exists to leverage the
innovative financing opportunities of organizations like OSC, the
Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and the Defense Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency (DARPA) to leap ahead in the space of
PCBs.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy, act-
ing through the Executive Agent for Printed Circuit Board and
Interconnect Technology and in coordination with the Directors of
the OSC, DIU, and DARPA; the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Industrial Base Policy; and the Principal Director for Microelec-
tronics in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research
and Engineering, to develop a roadmap and investment strategy for
next-generation PCBs and to provide a briefing to the congressional
defense committees, not later than June 1, 2026. Such briefing
shall include: (1) Identification of technological advances that
might require new technical approaches for PCB design and manu-
facture, including from foreign partners or allies; (2) Emerging re-
search in new PCB design, including internationally; (3) Survey of
private capital investment opportunities in current and next-gen-
eration PCBs; (4) Assessment of technical integration challenges
and opportunities for next-generation PCBs; and (5) Other such
considerations as the Executive Agent for Printed Circuit Board
and Interconnect Technology considers appropriate.
Project Pele
The committee is encouraged by the continued progress made by
the Department of Defense Strategic Capabilities Office on Project
Pele, an effort to design, build, and demonstrate a prototype mobile
micro nuclear fission reactor. In particular, the committee notes
the advancements made by Project Pele to meet the requirement
of demonstrating the ability of mobile nuclear power generation
technologies to comply fully with all relevant regulations and statu-
tory requirements, satisfy stakeholder needs, and operate safely in
real-world conditions.
Accordingly, given the continued investments in the mobile micro
nuclear reactor program, the committee encourages the Depart-
ment of Defense to consider using Project Pele as the technical
baseline for future micro nuclear fission reactors.

Finally, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not later
than May 1, 2026, to brief the congressional defense committees on
Department efforts to expedite and expand efforts to prototype and
evaluate advanced deployable nuclear energy systems capable of
supporting forward-deployed military forces, expeditionary mis-
sions, and resilient base operations. Such briefing shall address, at
a minimum:
(1) A Department-wide strategy to identify and develop
deployable nuclear energy solutions;
(2) A timeline for prototyping and initial testing of one or
more reactor designs;
(3) The means by which the Department will coordinate ef-
forts with other state and Federal agencies, as necessary; and
(4) The military requirements and key performance param-
eters for each separate design to be pursued.
Quantum algorithm development
The committee recognizes the importance of the Defense Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum
Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) program in making progress to de-
termine whether fault-tolerant utility-scale quantum computers
could plausibly be realized ahead of conventional predictions. The
committee also notes that while progress is being made on the
hardware underpinning quantum computing, the Department of
Defense also needs to be prepared with useful and functional algo-
rithms to operate on those machines once they do become available.
The committee believes the Department should be making such in-
vestments in parallel in order to maximize the benefits of quantum
computing should the investment manifest in a utility-scale ma-
chine. The committee supports DARPA’s efforts with QBI and en-
courages the program to identify industry performers to explore al-
gorithm development for quantum computing applications to en-
sure the maturation of that part of the industrial base.
Accordingly, the committee believes that advances in quantum
algorithms have the potential to enhance the ability to
computationally design and discover new advanced materials for a
broad set of national security applications across the Department
and the military services, among other applications.
Quantum benchmarking initiative
The committee notes that quantum computing has been identi-
fied as a critical technology where the United States must main-
tain its leadership. The committee strongly supports the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum
Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) as well as the consideration of all
relevant quantum computing technologies, including both gate-
model and annealing approaches, that have the potential to reach
utility-scale. The committee expects the DARPA Director to ensure
QBI evaluates all quantum computing modalities, within budgetary
and resource constraints, to determine the maturity and long-term
potential of quantum computing concepts, development plans, and
prototypes, components, and subsystems needed to develop a util-
ity-scale quantum computing capability.

Removing barriers to directed energy weapon system test-
ing, training, and exercising
The committee supports the continued development and fielding
of directed energy weapon systems as a critical component of future
U.S. military capabilities. These systems offer scalable, non-kinetic
options to address a range of operational challenges.
The committee, however, is concerned that current policies and
overly restrictive interpretations of legal authorities may unneces-
sarily limit the Department of Defense’s ability to conduct realistic
testing, training, and exercises with directed energy systems, even
in low-risk environments with only consenting participants. To ad-
dress these concerns, the committee supports efforts to thoughtfully
delegate appropriate approval authorities and remove barriers to
such activities when they do not pose risks to foreign relations,
arms control compliance, or nonconsenting parties. The committee
believes that continued, focused oversight will support faster inte-
gration of directed energy capabilities into the force.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026.
This briefing should include: (1) A summary of current testing,
training, and exercise activities involving directed energy weapon
systems across the Department of Defense; (2) Identification of pol-
icy, legal, or procedural barriers limiting such activities; (3) A re-
view of current approval authorities and their delegation; and (4)
Recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes needed to
facilitate broader operational use of directed energy weapons.
Researcher post-employment restrictions
The committee is concerned that the current level of oversight
and coordination between the Department of Defense and other rel-
evant federal agencies may not be robust enough when it comes to
assessing the potential impact of post-employment activities of re-
searchers who have participated on sensitive unclassified projects
funded by the Department but may be approached by foreign enti-
ties of concern for prospective employment. The committee notes
the potential benefits which a foreign government could receive if
such researchers accept employment with foreign entities of con-
cern after the conclusion of their research.
The committee further notes that there are existing processes for
research security that could support visibility into the breadth and
scope of this issue and help mitigate risks to broader national secu-
rity, though some of those processes are managed by interagency
partners. Therefore, the committee encourages the Department to
strengthen policies for research security to maintain visibility of
post-employment activities of Department-funded or Department-
employed researchers on unclassified topics and to mitigate any
negative impacts through increased synchronization with inter-
agency partners with authorities in this space.
University research
The committee understands that the economic and national secu-
rity of the United States, as well as our military effectiveness, de-
pends on sustained technological superiority. The committee also

understands that technological superiority is directly supported by
federally funded research conducted at our nation’s universities
that fuel the future science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics workforce.
The committee believes universities, university affiliated re-
search centers (UARCs), and their partners serve as trusted, long-
term partners to the Department of Defense (DOD), maintaining
specialized capabilities essential to mission success that are not
readily available in the commercial sector. The committee agrees
with the assessment of the Government Accountability Office in its
report from December 2018 titled ‘‘Defense Laboratory Authorities:
DOD Uses Authorities to Support Science and Technology, but
Could Strengthen Its Approach (GAO–19–64)’’ that UARCs enable
DOD to ‘‘maintain essential capabilities’’ and gain access to re-
search ‘‘where the private sector may not have sufficient incentive
to invest.’’
Therefore, the committee strongly recommends sustained invest-
ment by the Department in university research, including UARCs
and their partners, to ensure the United States maintains its edge
over near-peer competitors in emerging technologies and critical de-
fense capabilities. The committee further believes these invest-
ments have achieved positive outcomes in day-to-day operations of
the Department, including repairs to ships, submarines, ground ve-
hicles, aircraft, and weapons systems; air, land, and sea warfare;
arctic operations, healthcare, additive manufacturing, advanced
materials, hypersonics, directed energy, artificial intelligence, and
data analysis, accelerating readiness and increasing effectiveness
for the entire force.

Department of Defense to use any Federal or state-approved meth-
odology to destroy or dispose of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
substances.
Sec. 316—Modification to restriction on procurement or pur-
chasing of personal protective equipment for fire-
fighters containing perfluoroalkyl substances or
polyfluoroalkyl substances
The committee recommends a provision that would amend Sec-
tion 345 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) by updating the De-
partment of Defense firefighting personal protective equipment pro-
curement requirements to ensure that firefighting equipment

tions relating to the detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS)
substances on Department of Defense installations, and determine
interim actions to be taken to reduce immediate public exposure to
the release of PFAS. The provision would also require a report re-
garding various elements related to the preliminary assessment or
site investigation of facilities, their associated timelines, and any
relevant explanations of actions taken.
Subtitle C—Logistics and Sustainment
Sec. 321—Surface ship sustainment and readiness
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to enhance surface ship maintenance at pri-
vate shipyards through processes led by the Type Commanders
(TYCOMs) that emphasize workforce stability, ship-specific assign-
ments, collaborative planning, and small business involvement. The
provision would authorize the TYCOMs to oversee maintenance
and delegate decision-making authority to project managers, port
engineers, and ship commanding officers. The requirements under
this section would terminate on January 1, 2031.
The committee supports the Navy’s goal of achieving 80 percent
surge combat readiness for both conventional and nuclear ships, as
well as the Navy’s commitment to improving maintenance, repair,
and overhaul processes. The committee is concerned, however, that
the Navy’s contracting strategy with the private shipyards has led
to inefficiencies in planning and executing sustainment activities.
Moreover, it has led to workload instability that disincentivizes
capital and workforce investments. The committee is also con-
cerned with the diffusion of authority, responsibility, and account-
ability that has prevented timely decision making and integrated
management under an organization charged with the man, train,
and equip functions for the fleet. The committee believes that im-
plementing this provision would help alleviate these concerns.
Sec. 322—Technology enhancement for surface ship mainte-
nance
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to expedite the investigation, qualification,
and integration of specified advanced technologies and processes
into Navy surface ship maintenance to improve readiness, reduce
costs, and address delays. The provision would also: (1) Mandate
an open process for evaluating additional technologies within 90
days of their submission; (2) Require updated policies and modified
contracts; and (3) Require information on implementation timelines
and third-party reviews for non-selected technologies. The provision
would require the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
Congress, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act, detailing timelines to qualify and approve each ad-
vanced technology or process specified in the provision.

The committee recommends a provision that would designate
U.S. Transportation Command as the global manager for contested
logistics. The provision would also require an interim briefing on
progress and a report within 1 year on implementation of this des-
ignation.
The committee has been discouraged by the lack of a cohesive,
unified strategy by the Department of Defense. The committee be-
lieves that this course of action, similar to the designation of a sin-
gle manager for bulk fuel, would streamline the Department’s ef-
forts and create a renewed pathway to achieving a capability to
provide logistics support for U.S. Armed Forces in a contested envi-
ronment.
Sec. 324—Requirements for Department of Defense aircraft
operations near commercial airports
The committee recommends a provision that would require all
aircraft of the Department of Defense that operate near commercial
airports to be equipped with position broadcast technology. The
provision would require the development of standard operating pro-
cedures that maximize the use of such technology. Finally, the pro-
vision would require annual reports describing near miss incidents
involving military and commercial aircraft.

porting requirements on the operational status of the amphibious
warship fleet from 2026 to 2028 and by including an additional re-
quirement to report on a plan for maintenance and service life ex-
tensions that would retain active amphibious warships until re-
placement warships enter service in order to meet the requirement
for operationally available amphibious warships set forth in section
8062 of title 10, United States Code.
Sec. 326—Prohibition on closure of Army organic industrial
base sites

Secretary of Defense from closing any facility or sites that are part
of the Army’s organic industrial base. Not later than 120 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for
5 years, the Secretary of the Army shall submit to the congres-
sional defense committees a report on the status of all facilities in
the organic industrial base of the Army.

Secretary of Defense to establish a pilot program, for a period of
5 years, on arsenal workload sustainment within the Department
of Defense.
Subtitle D—Reports
Sec. 331—Modification of report on improved oversight for
implementation of Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization
Program of the Navy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 355(c)(2)(A) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) to include information on digital
infrastructure in the annual reporting requirement on the Depart-
ment of the Navy’s Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program.
Sec. 332—Modification of readiness report to include sum-
mary count of certain mishaps
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 482(b)(8) of title 10, United States Code, to reduce overburden-
some reporting requirements in the Semiannual Readiness Report
to Congress (SRRC). Previously, the SRRC included case-by-case
descriptions of each Class C mishap. The committee’s intent is to
streamline the SRRC and eliminate the case-by-case descriptions
for Class C mishaps but still retain a summary count of all Class
C mishaps.

ments necessary for reaching initial and full operational capability.
Sec. 343—Requirements for contracts relating to permanent
change of station moving process
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to include additional oversight mechanisms
for any renegotiation of the contract under the Global Household
Goods Contract in place as of the date of the enactment of this Act,
or negotiation of a new contract under the Global Household Goods
Contract or any successor program or contract.
The committee is concerned that the original Global Household
Goods Contract lacked proper oversight mechanisms leading to an
inability of the Department of Defense to safeguard the best inter-
est of servicemembers and their families.
Sec. 344—Limitation on transformation by the Army of pri-
mary helicopter training program at Fort Rucker, Ala-
bama
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of the Army from implementing any transformation of
the Initial Entry Rotary Wing training program until certain re-
porting requirements are met.

Sec. 345—Conveyance of certain aircraft from Air Force to
Arizona Aviation Historical Group, Phoenix, Arizona
The committee recommends a provision that would grant the Air
Force permissive authority to convey five surplus T–37B aircraft to
the Arizona Aviation Historical Group at no cost to the Govern-
ment.
Sec. 346—Limitation on use of funds by the Army until sub-
mittal of plan to integrate Joint Munitions Command
and Army Sustainment Command
The committee directs the Secretary of Army to provide a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, prior to the expenditure of the funds authorized
to be appropriated to restructure commands, on its proposed plan
to integrate the Joint Munitions Command and the Army
Sustainment Command.
Sec. 347—Limitation on use of certain funds of the Air Force
until acquisition strategy submitted to maintain Air-
borne Command Post capability
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 travel funds for the Sec-
retary of the Air Force until the Secretary of the Air Force submits
a report on the acquisition strategy of the Air Force to maintain
the Airborne Command Post capability.
Sec. 348—Pilot program for contracted amphibious air re-
sources for the area of responsibility of the United
States Indo-Pacific Command
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to establish and maintain a 3-year pilot pro-
gram for the contracted operation of a fleet of commercial amphib-
ious aviation resources for tasking within the area of responsibility
of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.
Sec. 349—Naming of certain assets of the Department of De-
fense in the Commonwealth of Virginia
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to implement the naming recommendations
for assets of the Department of Defense located in the Common-
wealth of Virginia that were adopted by the base naming commis-
sion.
Budget Items
Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Pro-
gram
The committee notes that in the section 4301 table for Operation
and Maintenance, Defense-Wide, there is an increase to SAG
4GTN, Office of the Secretary of Defense of $20.0 million for Readi-
ness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI).
The committee notes that REPI funding, combined with funding
from state and local government and other non-government organi-
zation partners, helps the Department of Defense (DOD) prevent

encroachment and reduces threats to military installation resil-
ience. The committee anticipates that the military services will
identify validated requirements for fiscal year 2026 in excess of the
$158.3 million requested. Additionally, the committee encourages
the military services to establish and resource additional staff to
increase capacity to more effectively implement available REPI
funds and to take full advantage of the benefits of the REPI pro-
gram to improve military readiness and military installation resil-
ience.
Items of Special Interest
Advanced software for Navy and Marine Corps readiness
data
The committee applauds the Army and the Air Force for deploy-
ing advanced software platforms with capabilities that allow com-
manders and servicemembers to track, monitor, and better inform
unit readiness reporting for personnel, equipment, status of that
equipment, and training. The Army and the Air Force’s ability to
derive insights from this data better informs and enhances unit
readiness reporting.
The committee encourages the Navy and the Marine Corps to de-
ploy similar technologies that will enable unit commanders to le-
verage similar benefits to better inform their readiness reporting.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
brief to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on plans
to deploy advanced software that enables the tracking, monitoring,
and improvement of key metrics to align with the overall readiness
objectives for the Department of Defense.
Aerial firefighting enhancement
The committee recognizes that fire season is year-round and that
additional resources are required to suppress catastrophic
wildfires. The lack of availability for spare parts hampers some
state, local, and private sector entities in conducting aerial wildfire
suppression missions. Additionally, the sale of parts could help the
United States maintain its existing aerial firefighting aircraft fleet.
The committee notes that Congress originally adopted such a provi-
sion in 1996 but that the authority expired in 2005. Congress again
authorized such authority in 2012, but that authority lapsed in

Section 6:
2017.
The committee notes that in 2025, the President signed a bill,
the Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act of 2025 (Public Law 119–
8), that authorized a new 10-year period for the Secretary of De-
fense to sell excess Department of Defense aircraft and aircraft
parts to persons or entities that contract with the Government for
the delivery of fire retardant or water by air to suppress wildfires.
This law requires that such aircraft or spare parts be used only for
wildfire suppression.
The committee recognizes the importance of this new authority
and encourages the Department to use this law to actively respond
to the growing wildfire crisis. The committee believes this law will
strengthen national readiness for wildfire response and suppres-

sion during the year-round fire season. The committee will con-
tinue to monitor the implementation of this legislation and work
with the Department to determine if additional legislation is need-
ed.
Army field-level maintenance in a contested environment
The committee notes that the Army is moving toward a division-
based force to better position ground forces for large-scale combat
operations. Theater armies, corps, and divisions need to take the
lead in coordinating large-scale campaigns against well-armed na-
tion-states, with brigade-level forces fully focused on winning the
direct force-on-force engagements. The committee believes that the
Army’s ability to sustain operations while under fire means that
forces at all levels will need to be able to repair battle-damaged
tanks, personnel carriers, trucks, and other ground vehicles—espe-
cially when the ability to reach back to the United States for depot
maintenance, personnel support, and supplies is contested.
At the same time, the committee understands that the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s preliminary work on an ongoing report
has shown that field-level maintenance is growing more complex
and challenging because the Army is fielding multiple ground vehi-
cle variants. Given these and other challenges, the committee is in-
terested in further examining the Army’s plans for ensuring its
combat units are effectively organized, trained, and equipped to
perform field-level maintenance when operating in a contested en-
vironment.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller General of
the United States to assess the following: (1) How the Army is ad-
justing its field maintenance forces to sustain large-scale combat
operations in a contested environment; (2) The extent to which the
Army has identified and addressed field-level maintenance chal-
lenges at the brigade, division, corps, and theater levels through
combat training center rotations and warfighter exercises for fight-
ing in a contested environment; (3) The extent to which the Army
has provided its field maintenance forces with the tools, technology,
training, and equipment they need to perform field maintenance
when operating in a contested environment; and (4) Any other re-
lated matters the Comptroller General considers appropriate.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than April 1, 2026, on the Comptroller General’s preliminary find-
ings and to present final results in a format and timeframe agreed
to at the time of the briefing.
Army strategy and requirements for wildfire suppression
mission
The committee notes that over the last 10 years, wildfires in the
United States have grown in frequency, size, destructive capacity,
and cost. Given the threat of more frequent and larger wildfires,
communities increasingly rely on U.S. Army personnel in signifi-
cant numbers to augment dwindling U.S. Forest Service fire-
fighting capabilities. In 2024 alone, more than 2,000 Army Active,
Guard, and Reserve personnel were deployed to carry out wildfire
suppression duties, including direct firefighting and suppression,

air and ground logistics support, and evacuations and security. In
January 2025, 1,200 personnel from the Washington Army Na-
tional Guard were activated to address the wildfires that destroyed
more than 18,000 homes and other structures in southern Cali-
fornia. Unfortunately, this mission emerged so quickly that the
U.S. Army did not have time to develop requirements for wildfire
response. Consequently, U.S. Army units received inconsistent
training and dangerously outdated equipment to meet the fire-
fighting mission.
As the frequency, scope, and destructive power of wildfires con-
tinues to grow, U.S. Army personnel continue to be called upon to
protect American communities. The committee understands that
deploying home-stationed U.S. Army units for this mission is in-
creasingly essential for successful wildfire suppression missions in
support of communities around the country facing wildfire threats.
However, the committee is concerned that the Department of De-
fense has not methodically assessed this emergent mission and
lacks a strategy and requirements for meeting it. In particular, the
committee is concerned that, absent a formal wildfire firefighting
requirement, the U.S. Army will continue to rely on equipment,
provided by other agencies, that does not meet U.S. Army stand-
ards designed to protect readiness and ensure effective operations
of units deployed to meet this mission.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 1, 2026, on the U.S. Army’s strategy and
requirements for meeting the emergent wildfire suppression mis-
sion. The briefing should include: (1) The current process for pro-
curing mission-specific equipment, such as load carriage, for Active,
Guard, and Reserve units; (2) A strategy and timeline for assessing
the quality and suitability of equipment currently issued to ensure
mission readiness and mitigate fatigue and injury; and (3) An as-
sessment of the needs and benefits of establishing a formal U.S.
Army requirement for wildfire response, including the opportunity
to procure appropriate equipment.
Blast exposure and weapons sensors for Special Operations
Forces
The committee notes that U.S. Special Operations Command
(SOCOM) is working to identify blast overpressure exposure result-
ing from heavy weapons systems use, breaching, and small arms
in dynamic combat and training environments. However, the com-
mittee understands SOCOM’s knowledge of the effect of blast expo-
sure may be limited by lack of objective blast exposure monitoring
data. The committee also notes that the cumulative effects of small
arms and crew-served weapons use may contribute to brain inju-
ries.
The committee believes the development of new sensors, includ-
ing sensors enabled by artificial intelligence, may enable greater
understanding of blast overpressure events and the cumulative ef-
fect of other weapons on the long-term health of special operations
forces.
Therefore, the committee encourages the Commander, SOCOM,
to continue testing and fielding, as appropriate, blast exposure and

other weapons sensors to support the safety and welfare of special
operations forces.
Additionally, the committee directs the Commander, SOCOM, to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than December 31,
2025, regarding blast exposure and weapons sensor development
efforts, including testing and potential plans for fielding of such
sensors.
Briefing on activation of power projection wings by U.S. Air
Force Special Operations Command
The committee notes that the U.S. Air Force Special Operations
Command is in the process of establishing power projection wings
with the objective of more effectively supporting the requirements
of the geographic combatant commanders.
Accordingly, not later than March 1, 2026, the committee directs
the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command, and the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Inten-
sity Conflict, to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the sta-
tus of the activation of power projection wings. At a minimum, the
briefing should identify: (1) Roles, responsibilities, and anticipated
missions of the power projection wings; (2) The personnel, aircraft,
and equipment that will be transferred from other installations to
support the activation of power projection wings; (3) Any additional
resourcing or authorities that may be needed to complete the acti-
vation of power projection wings; and (4) Any other matters
deemed relevant by the Commander and Assistant Secretary.
Briefing on advanced manufacturing
The committee notes that innovations in advanced manufac-
turing have the potential to make producing parts for weapons and
weapons systems faster, cheaper, more customizable, and more mo-
bile than existing, traditional manufacturing techniques. The com-
mittee understands that metal and polymer-based advanced manu-
facturing processes have the potential to change the way the Joint
Force plans combat and sustainment operations. Integrating ad-
vanced manufacturing capabilities as an inherent foundational
sustainment capability and proliferating access to advanced manu-
factured products to every operational unit will shorten logistics
tails and timelines, decrease maintenance costs and delays, and
empower each warfighter with the tools and equipment they need
to execute their missions more efficiently and effectively.
The committee believes that the establishment of the Joint Addi-
tive Manufacturing Working Group in 2017 and the release of the
first Department of Defense (DOD) Additive Manufacturing Strat-
egy in 2021 were important steps toward capitalizing on innova-
tions in advanced manufacturing. Since the release of the strategy,
however, the DOD has made modest investments in advanced man-
ufacturing technologies and methods relative to the potential out-
sized impacts that advanced manufacturing can have on military
operations, maintenance, sustainment, and logistics, should the ca-
pability be proliferated widely. The committee believes the Depart-
ment should accelerate efforts to develop common technology,

standards, and processes for advanced manufacturing that will en-
able the military services to share data and increase readiness with
the goal of proliferating advanced manufacturing capabilities
across units at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Secre-
taries of the military departments and the Director of the Defense
Logistics Agency, to provide a briefing, not later than February 1,
2026, on: (1) How the military services currently determine how
advanced manufacturing capabilities are deployed; and (2) Chal-
lenges to equipping operational units with advanced manufacturing
capabilities for maintenance and repair in the field.
Briefing on Defense Language and National Security Edu-
cation Office and future planning for foreign language
programs
The committee recognizes that, in partnership with universities
and senior military colleges across the country, the Defense Lan-
guage and National Security Education Office provides important
training for servicemembers for the purposes of accelerating the de-
velopment of foundational expertise in critical and strategic lan-
guages and regional area studies. The committee notes that these
programs support critical language acquisition and training for the
U.S. active duty military, National Guard and Reservists, other De-
partment of Defense personnel, Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
(ROTC) cadets and midshipmen, and U.S. graduate and under-
graduate students who are committed to federal service.
The committee notes with concern that, due to budget con-
straints, fewer programs were funded in fiscal year 2024. In the
case of Language Training Centers, no programs are expected to be
funded in fiscal year 2025, reducing capacity at higher education
partners and significantly limiting access to critical and strategic
languages including Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and Korean. Fur-
ther, the committee believes these constraints present challenges
for retention and recruitment of existing program infrastructure ca-
pabilities and qualified academic instructors with the language flu-
ency and expertise in the areas of the world critical to current and
long-term U.S. national security interests. The committee believes
the inroads made by higher education partners such as the Univer-
sity of Mississippi, the University of Rhode Island, the University
of Arizona, and James Madison University, as well as many others,
are crucial to sustaining and growing these vital programs, but
adequate resources are required. The committee is concerned that
despite section 575 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) amending the statute au-
thorizing the Language Training Center to require the Secretary of
Defense to carry out the program, the Department failed to budget
any funding in fiscal year 2025, effectively halting the program.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the congressional defense committees, not later than January
1, 2026, on maintaining critical and strategic language proficiency
for servicemembers and ROTC students. This briefing shall in-
clude: (1) Optimal requirements for training in languages and cul-
tures critical to national security, to include the necessary funding

levels to meet and sustain such requirements; (2) An evaluation of
the Department’s readiness posture as it relates to language capa-
bilities; (3) The capacity to increase strategic languages in response
to emerging language requirements; and (4) The Department’s
funding plan across the future years defense program for the Lan-
guage Flagship Program, Project Global Officer, Language Training
Centers, and Boren Awards.
Further, the committee encourages the Department to continue
placing a high priority on the Language Flagship Program, Project
Global Officer, Language Training Centers, and Boren Awards,
with an emphasis on quality of instruction and a preference for
programs that provide college credit and have strategic value to
U.S. national security interests.
Briefing on software development and acquisition capabili-
ties for U.S. Special Operations Command
The committee notes the critical role that software plays in ena-
bling military capabilities, including those of U.S. Special Oper-
ations Forces. However, the committee is concerned that U.S. Spe-
cial Operations Command (SOCOM) may require more robust soft-
ware development and acquisition capabilities to fulfill special op-
erations-peculiar requirements.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Commander, SOCOM, in
coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Sustainment, to provide a briefing, not later than December
31, 2025, to the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the
feasibility and advisability of establishing more robust software de-
velopment and acquisition capabilities, sometimes referred to as a
software factory, to enable the fielding of special operations-pecu-
liar software solutions, enhance cyber security, and support the
classified defense technology projects of SOCOM. At a minimum,
the briefing should address: (1) The extent to which the establish-
ment of such software development and acquisition capabilities
would improve the development and acquisition of software to ful-
fill special operations-peculiar requirements; (2) The resources, fa-
cilities, personnel, and authorities that would be required to estab-
lish such software development and acquisition capabilities; (3)
How SOCOM software development and acquisition capabilities
would augment, coordinate with, and add value to existing Depart-
ment of Defense software development activities; (4) Whether the
establishment of such SOCOM software development and acquisi-
tion capabilities would facilitate the recruitment and transition of
qualified personnel into full-time employment with SOCOM and
other elements of the Department of Defense, including through in-
ternship opportunities; and (5) Any other matters deemed relevant
by the Commander, SOCOM.
Comptroller General review of capabilities and planning for
sensitive crisis response operations
The committee notes that the joint posture statement for 2025

mander, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) states, ‘‘In
the past three years, the requirements for SOCOM to fulfill its cri-

sis response remit increased more than 170% over the previous
decade’s annual average . . . Presidentially directed crisis response
operations are inherently unpredictable and vary year-to-year in
timing, duration, and total cost. Operational and logistics costs for
crisis response increased more than 250% from FY20 to FY23. With
increases in the frequency of crises and compounded costs, SOCOM
has paid for previous crises response deployments, drawing away
from SOCOM’s total modernization efforts that aim to meet future
challenges.’’
The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense
(DOD) has not planned or budgeted for the increased use of and
reliance on crisis response forces, including responding forces and
critical enabling support. Specifically, it is unclear if the DOD has
budgeted appropriately and sustainably for these operations or if it
has taken needed steps to ensure crisis response forces maintain
appropriate levels of readiness and availability. Therefore, the com-
mittee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to re-
view the DOD’s planning and budgeting for sensitive crisis re-
sponse operations by assessing: (1) Effects of changes in the stra-
tegic environment on guidance, preparation, and planning for sen-
sitive crisis response operations; (2) Trends in the number and na-
ture of sensitive crisis response operations and corresponding read-
iness impacts to responding units and enabling support; (3) As-
sumptions the DOD and other agencies make for enabling support
for sensitive crisis response operations; (4) Processes and proce-
dures that the DOD and other federal agencies follow when plan-
ning and budgeting for sensitive crisis response operations to en-
sure resources, personnel, and exquisite capabilities are available;
(5) Plans that the DOD may have for responding to multiple simul-
taneous crises that require intelligence and sensitive activity capa-
bilities and the extent to which the DOD has coordinated these
plans with other relevant agencies; and (6) Other matters that the
Comptroller General deems to be relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives not later than April 1, 2026. A
determination of a final product will be made at the time of those
briefings.
Expanding Arctic training
The committee notes that much of the Department of Defense’s
(DOD) Arctic expertise resides in the reserve components, including
the National Guard. The committee further notes, however, that
the DOD will need to rely on the capabilities and expertise pro-
vided by the total force to achieve success in the Arctic. To operate
in the changing Arctic environment, the committee believes that
the Joint Force must have the requisite skills, training, and experi-
ence.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
submit a report to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than January 15, 2026, on locations in which the Army could estab-
lish or expand Arctic training and exercises in order to test soldiers
and equipment to meet requirements for operating in Arctic and
cold weather conditions. The report should include additional sites

to conduct the Army’s Cold Weather Orientation Course, Cold
Weather Leader Course, and Isolation Survival in Cold Regions
Course. Additionally, the report should examine tactical, technical,
and logistical challenges unique to operating in extreme cold
weather conditions and how additional cold weather training loca-
tions would impact readiness.
Feasibility of floating drydock
The committee recognizes the critical strategic and logistical role
public shipyards play in the security of the Nation. The committee
strongly supports efforts to modernize and improve facilities at the
Navy’s four public shipyards, including the multi-mission dry dock,
and to address the complex maintenance needs of the Navy’s cur-
rent and future active fleet. The current modernization plans for
Navy shipyards include converting dry docks to focus on depot-level
maintenance for nuclear submarines.
To better understand the Navy’s options for a floating dry dock
to address any infrastructure shortfalls, the committee directs the
Secretary of the Navy to provide a briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than March 1, 2026, detailing:
(1) Potential locations for mooring a floating dry dock;
(2) A list of the individual major military construction
projects needed to support a floating dry dock;
(3) The earliest a floating dry dock could be brought into
service and a description of constraints; and
(4) How a floating dry dock would be used to ensure extra
capacity for potential crisis in the event of a military conflict.
FireGuard
The committee continues to support the FireGuard program as
an essential tool for federal, state, and local firefighters to aggre-
gate, analyze, and assess multi-source remote sensing information
for interagency partnerships in the detection and monitoring of
wildfires, given their increasing frequency and scope of damage
across the United States.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 1, 2026, identifying where in the Department of
Defense FireGuard should reside as a program of record. The brief-
ing should also include: (1) A plan for funding and manning to the
levels required; (2) The number and names of states, territories,
counties, municipalities, and tribal governments to whom
FireGuard has provided fire intelligence services; (3) A comparative
analysis of polygons provided by FireGuard for wildfires and end-
state perimeters of the same wildfires; (4) An analysis of the time
between detection via raw satellite data and the alerts being sent
to local responders; and (5) A review of efforts undertaken to inte-
grate emerging satellite and aerial surveillance technologies from
qualified private, nonprofit, and public sector sources.
Guam invasive species mitigation

that is currently deployed to Guam and that the tyranny of dis-
tance can lead to long lead times for replacement parts.
The committee understands that Guam is currently combatting
the Vespa Tropica, or the greater banded hornet, which is an
invasive species that was first discovered on the island in 2016.
The committee further understands that this species is extremely
aggressive and can wreak havoc on mission critical systems, such
as aircraft engines and generators, which would lead to degraded
readiness for potentially long periods of time. As a major inter- and
intra-theater logistical point for the Indo-Pacific region, Guam also
has the potential to serve as a source of spread for such invasive
species to other areas, if mitigation or eradication measures are not
taken seriously.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
coordination with relevant local authorities, to provide a one-time
briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than
November 3, 2025, on an action plan to combat the greater banded
hornet, and any other similar invasive species, to help mitigate po-
tential readiness concerns. Such a briefing should include the fol-
lowing: (1) A plan for a baseline survey for mapping nest occur-
rences to identify infestation areas, as well as the parties with re-
sponsibility over those areas; (2) A plan for conducting a baseline
scientific survey on greater banded hornet territory area to deter-
mine colony size, life cycle, and seasonality in order to estimate the
eradication planning needs for required personnel, technology,
eradication strategy, and other safety concerns; (3) An estimate of
personnel hours, technology, and resources needed for each phase,
including for post-eradication verification and potential long-term
management issues; and (4) A plan for consultation with local au-
thorities from other areas facing similar infestations to apply les-
sons learned and propose efficiencies leveraging prior and current

Head and hearing protection for aircraft maintenance per-
sonnel
The committee understands that head and hearing protection
systems are widespread across the Department of Defense. How-
ever, occupational safety extends beyond traditional combat arms
roles and should also include protective measures for personnel in
career fields such as aircraft maintenance. The committee recog-
nizes that the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps require head im-
pact and hearing protection for maintenance personnel working on
or near military aircraft. This requirement has proven to be an ef-
fective tool in mitigating the risk of injuries in dynamic and haz-
ardous work environments. However, the committee understands
that U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force maintenance personnel are not
currently required to wear similar protective gear while working on
military aircraft. While fall-prevention systems are often in use,
they do not fully address the risk of impact injuries to the head
and neck, prevent long-term hearing loss, or provide necessary eye
protection. With widely available solutions already in existence,
such as those already fielded by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine

Corps, the committee believes that U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force
maintainers should be provided with similar protective capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretaries of the Army
and Air Force to coordinate a joint brief to the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1) Each service’s
current policies on head and hearing protection for maintenance
personnel working on or near military aircraft; (2) An assessment
of injury rates and risk factors related to head trauma and hearing
loss in aviation maintenance career fields; and (3) A plan for evalu-
ating and potentially fielding commercial head protection solutions
to address these risks.
Inclusion of personal protective equipment and organiza-
tional clothing and individual equipment items in Army
Transformation in Contact
The committee supports U.S. Army efforts to accelerate oper-
ational testing and integration of emerging, commercially available
capabilities into its Transformation in Contact (TIC) initiative and
to identify opportunities to provide funding more efficiently across
capability sets. The committee also applauds the U.S. Army’s ef-
forts to incorporate a range of environments and climate conditions
in its experimentation.
The committee notes its longstanding support of the Soldier En-
hancement Program (SEP) as a rapid innovation pipeline for sol-
dier gear and equipment. As designed, the SEP has served as an
effective process designed to help the U.S. Army move at ‘‘the
speed of industry’’ by evaluating existing prototypes or commer-
cially available items that could enhance soldiers’ ability to execute
their combat mission. The SEP continues to serve a unique and
critical function in enabling the accelerated evaluation and pro-
curement of off-the-shelf items that have the potential to substan-
tially improve weapons and support equipment that are focused on
critical war-fighting functional areas of fires, mission command,
movement and maneuver, sustainability, and protection. In par-
ticular, the committee believes that personal protective equipment
(PPE) and organizational clothing and individual equipment
(OCIE) should be included in U.S. Army TIC efforts given the ro-
bust availability of commercial, off-the-shelf PPE and OCIE alter-
natives.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, on how the U.S. Army is including PPE and OCIE into its
TIC efforts and how the U.S. Army is leveraging existing programs
such as the SEP to facilitate and expand rapid operational testing
of those items.
Interagency integration on Arctic planning, testing, and op-
erations
The committee recognizes that the Arctic region presents geo-
political challenges and opportunities affecting national security in-
terests and is supportive of efforts to better understand the emerg-
ing needs for enhanced operations in the Arctic region. The com-
mittee encourages the Secretary of Defense to seek opportunities to

partner with interagency organizations, the Center for Arctic Secu-
rity and Resiliency, and the Joint All Domain Weather Operations
Center, to coordinate Federal agency planning for Arctic operations
as well as testing of systems to support Arctic operations.
Intermittent fault detection and isolation technology
One of the major cost drivers for the Department of Defense
(DOD) is the maintenance of electronics and electrical systems that
control and operate a wide range inventory of weapons and weapon
systems. The Department spends billions per year maintaining
electronics and electronic systems. One of the highest contributing
causes for these costs is operationally induced intermittent elec-
tronic faults that result in no fault found, cannot duplicate, or no
trouble found test results—essentially false readings to the effect
that there is no problem. Per a Department report to Congress
dated October 5, 2021, ‘‘Assessment of Electronics Maintenance as
a Leading Driver of Weapon Systems Non-Availability’’, there is an
available test technology that could detect and reverse the inter-
mittent fault problem across the spectrum of DOD weapon systems
with the initial targets being various aircraft, including the F–35,
F–16, and F/A–18. Additionally, a January 14, 2020, Government
Accountability Office report titled ‘‘Senior Leaders Should Empha-
size Key Practices to Improve Weapon System Reliability’’ (GAO–
20–151) highlighted the major improvements in flight hours, repair
times, and cost savings that resulted from the use of the tech-
nology.
Accordingly, the committee recommends that the Department
sustain funding for this critical intermittent fault detection and iso-
lation technology.
Military working equid report
The committee understands that the U.S. Army intends to elimi-
nate all military working equid detachments other than the Cais-
son units at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Joint Base San An-
tonio, and the mules at the United States Military Academy. These
detachments did not fall under formal authorization documents
and were, therefore, perpetually under-resourced and lacked suffi-
cient oversight. While, in response to committee urging, the U.S.
Army initiated more rigorous, centralized oversight by U.S. Army
veterinarians, the U.S. Army has continued to manage and re-
source these detachments in an ad hoc manner. As a result, there
remains high risk to the safety and welfare of the equids and insuf-
ficient resources. The committee is concerned that the U.S. Army
did not conduct rigorous analysis or consider the historic signifi-
cance of these detachments in its decision to disestablish. Addition-
ally, previous U.S. Army efforts to retire military working equids
have been marred by mismanagement and lack of concern for equid
welfare after the end of their service to the U.S. Army.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than January 15, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives that includes the following:
(1) A description, to include home station, of all military
working equid (MWE) detachments eliminated;

(2) The detailed analysis that led to the U.S. Army’s decision
to disestablish MWE detachments, including:
(a) A detailed review of the health of the herd in each
location, to include information on the health of each
horse, nutrition and fitness, as well as an assessment of
turnout and space requirements and whether host installa-
tion possessed necessary space;
(b) A detailed assessment of borrowed military man-
power and necessary manpower required at each detach-
ment, to include cost and how manpower needs were deter-
mined;
(c) A detailed cost assessment for the facility and oper-
ational requirements for each program, broken out by in-
vestments made in prior years, estimates for necessary fu-
ture improvements to facilities, and standard operating
costs required to maintain each detachment as appropriate
to their mission;
(d) A description of consultations between U.S. Army
leadership and host unit, installation, community, and as-
sociated historic military unit association conducted as
part of the U.S. Army’s decision; and
(e) Any other matters the Secretary determines relevant;
and
(3) A description of the U.S. Army plan, to include timelines,
processes for assessing suitability, and conditions to be met be-
fore a determination is made, to transition a MWE associated
with disestablished detachments out of care by the U.S. Army.
Northern Strike Exercises
The committee notes that the annual Northern Strike Exercise
is a large, all-domain reserve forces exercise. The committee be-
lieves it provides a realistic, decisive action training environment
as well as robust training experiences for units and leaders to
strengthen joint all-domain warfighting capabilities. Further, it
fills a critical gap in resourced readiness building multi-domain ex-
ercises for National Guard combat formations. Resident within the
State of Michigan, Northern Strike is conducted twice a year (win-
ter and summer) within the four-season National All-Domain
Warfighting Center’s contested multi-domain operating environ-
ment. Using a combination of integrated live, virtual, and construc-
tive models and simulations, participants increase Mission Essen-
tial Task proficiencies and build readiness through repetitive task
iterations at echelon by training for combat operations as part of
the joint team. The committee believes that Northern Strike is at
the forefront of unmanned aerial systems and counter unmanned
aerial systems training that provide individual servicemembers
critical exposure to current, real-world threats.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Department of De-
fense to establish recurring funding for this critical exercise series.
Operational energy
The committee notes that longer operating distances, remote and
austere geography, and anti-access/area denial threats have chal-
lenged the Department of Defense’s (DOD) ability to deliver fuel.
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:16 Jul 19, 2025 Jkt 061121 PO 00000 Frm 00109 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6602 E:\HR\OC\SR039.XXX SR039

Without fuel, the DOD cannot deploy and sustain forces around the
globe. Reducing these burdens, even if just in the margins, enables
warfighters to be more lethal. As such, the committee supports re-
ducing the footprint of the Joint Force in expeditionary operations,
which increases the survivability of warfighters while reducing
strain on sustainment requirements.
For example, the Air Force saved at least $124.0 million in fiscal
year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2019 using operational energy
advances. Microvanes on C–17 aircraft reduce drag by about 1 per-
cent, pay for themselves in just 7 months, and save at least $12.7
million each year in fuel costs. Unfortunately, the committee un-
derstands that microvanes are currently on only 10 C–17 aircraft.
Aft body drag reduction devices on C–130 aircraft yield about $18.0
million in fuel savings each year. KC–135 finlets reduce drag by
about 2 percent yet save $13.2 million each year. Mission planning
software programs like Jigsaw and Pythagoras lead to about 10
percent improvements in flight efficiency across the fleet.
The committee notes that the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft
is a promising design that can operate more efficiently in contested
environments by offering at least 30 percent more aerodynamic ef-
ficiency versus a 767. The committee understands that the BWB of-
fers 90 percent more range, a 94 percent increase in fuel offload ca-
pability at a 2,500 nautical mile radius resulting in increased fight-
er sortie generation, upwards of 50 percent more fuel efficiency,
takes up 40 percent less space on airfields, flies 2,000 feet higher,
and requires less landing and takeoff distance. Beyond these tac-
tical benefits, the BWB design would save the Air Force at least
$900.0 million per year on fuel.
The committee notes that on the ground, hybrid vehicle capabili-
ties offer longer operational duration and lower fuel consumption.
For example, the Army successfully demonstrated a hybrid tactical
vehicle in Europe last winter that operated a brigade command
post for 10 days on just 10 gallons of fuel.
Accordingly, the committee continues to support energy demand
reduction efforts and programs that extend the operational reach
for warfighters and enable our military’s lethality and readiness.
Organic industrial base expansion
The committee remains convinced of the imperative to accelerate
the modernization and expansion of the Army’s organic industrial
base. To ensure that the Army is moving forward with this effort,
the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on the Army’s
plans and way forward on establishing production lines for: (1) A
secondary domestic source of military-grade nitrocellulose; or (2)
Any of 13 precursor chemicals used widely across the Joint Pro-
gram Executive Office Armaments & Ammunition portfolio that are
currently sourced solely from China; or (3) Producing any of the
300 chemicals identified as single point failures by the Joint Pro-
gram Executive Office Armaments & Ammunition; or (4) A load
and pack facility capable of servicing multiple calibers of ammuni-
tion; or (5) A combination of the above options.

This report should include the Army’s plans to either modernize,
expand, or use military construction funds to build new facilities.
Quantum sensing technologies for addressing perfluoroalkyl
and polyfluoroalkyl contamination
Over 700 U.S. military sites are known to have, or known to
have likely, discharged per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals.
The committee notes that current available methods to detect
PFAS include gas or liquid chromatography, which is expensive,
time consuming, and unsuitable for on-site testing or identification.
In November 2024, the Strategic Environmental Research and De-
velopment Program (SERDP) released a Statement of Need to de-
velop a real-time sensor for detecting and quantifying PFAS chemi-
cals, which would allow for more time- and cost-efficient site inves-
tigations and remediation. To date, no field-based rapid screening
technologies are commercially available for PFAS detection. While
the Department of Defense (DOD) has significantly invested in
PFAS remediation, current detection methods are limited by cost,
speed, and sensitivity.
The committee is encouraged by the potential promise of quan-
tum technology to fill this gap. Quantum sensors can leverage the
principles of quantum mechanics to achieve levels of extreme preci-
sion that were previously considered unattainable. In this context,
quantum science could be used to help detection platforms achieve
unprecedented sensitivity and allow for ultra-sensitive, real-time
detection and mapping of PFAS in soil and groundwater.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, in coordination
with the SERDP and the Environmental Security Technology Cer-
tification Program, to brief the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March
15, 2026, on:
(1) The technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and perform-
ance potential of quantum sensing technologies for the detec-
tion and monitoring of PFAS at DOD sites;
(2) A comparison of quantum sensing capabilities with exist-
ing and emerging technologies for the detection of PFAS;
(3) A framework for integrating quantum sensing with strat-
egies for remediating PFAS, including sensor-informed deg-
radation approaches; and
(4) Recommendations, as appropriate, for next steps to accel-
erate the development, deployment, and transition of quantum
sensing tools for environmental monitoring and cleanup of
PFAS.
Report on hexavalent chromium

rooms, to meet current safety codes and regulations; (2) An assess-
ment of the Department of Defense’s interim control measures in
place at installations where the infrastructure is not up to code, in-
cluding any additional safeguards to protect servicemembers and
civilian personnel; and (3) Recommendations for improving existing
infrastructure, practices, and policies to ensure a safer working en-
vironment, ultimately protecting the health and well-being of mili-
tary personnel and civilian employees exposed to hazardous mate-
rials during these operations.
Special Operations Digital Force Protection
The committee notes that adversaries increasingly exploit the
commercial digital surveillance economy as a low-cost, low-risk
method of targeting U.S. forces. By reducing U.S. forces’ digital sig-
nature exposure and adversary tracking, digital force protection
strengthens overall force protection, operational security, and stra-
tegic deception efforts across all domains of warfare. The committee
believes digital force protection is a critical enabler of multi-domain
operations, ensuring that U.S. forces can operate seamlessly across
land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace without adversarial digital ex-
ploitation undermining mission success. Effective digital force pro-
tection also imposes costs on adversaries by complicating their abil-
ity to detect, track, or exploit U.S. personnel and assets through
commercial data aggregation, as well as related open-source intel-
ligence, signals intelligence, and adversarial artificial intelligence-
powered analytics.
The committee believes that U.S. Special Operations Forces
(SOF) are especially vulnerable to adversarial exploitation of the
commercial digital surveillance economy and ubiquitous technical
surveillance (UTS) capabilities given the sensitive, multi-domain
operations they carry out globally.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the
Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees a briefing, not later than
October 1, 2025, which includes: (1) An assessment of the threat
posed by UTS to the force protection and mission effectiveness of
SOF; (2) A description of ongoing or planned efforts by SOCOM to
address the threat posed by UTS; (3) An assessment of available
technical solutions to address the threat posed by UTS, including
government-owned and commercially available technologies; (4) A
description of any challenges to address the threat posed by UTS,
including Department of Defense policies, authorities, and
resourcing; and (5) Any other matters deemed relevant by the As-
sistant Secretary and the Commander.
Survival, evasion, resistance, and escape complex
The committee notes the importance of Survival, Evasion, Resist-
ance, and Escape (SERE) training for U.S. Army aviators during
the course of their training at Fort Novosel. The committee is con-
cerned that continued delays in completing this essential training
facility could adversely impact the readiness of deployed U.S. Army
aviators.

Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 1, 2026, on the progress and timeline
for completion of the SERE training facility at Fort Rucker.
United States-made Army training aircraft
The committee understands that the Army is considering
transitioning the Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) pilot training
to a contractor owned and operated training model, as part of its
Flight School Next initiative. The committee is aware that such a
change may result in the use of a new primary training helicopter.
The committee appreciates the use of domestically manufactured
helicopters in IERW pilot training and, therefore, urges the Army
to ensure that any new contract for IERW pilot training is per-
formed on a domestically produced helicopter.
Wing additive manufacturing
The committee notes that wing-level additive manufacturing
(AM) capability provides a significant increase in mission readiness
and meets the demands of aircraft maintainers with cost and time
savings compared to legacy repair methods and supply system al-
ternatives. The committee believes that expanding this organic ca-
pability is necessary for our Nation’s premier conventional and nu-
clear long-range strike force to maintain peak mission readiness
and to support strategic deterrence.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the U.S. Air Force to es-
tablish AM facilities at additional installations to better support
conventional and nuclear long-range strike platforms and mission
support systems. The committee believes this will improve aircraft
readiness and decrease reliance on lagging supply chains, better
enabling aircraft maintainers to conduct timely and precision re-
pairs.

TITLE V—MILITARY PERSONNEL POLICY
Subtitle A—Officer Personnel Policy
Sec. 501—Statutory adjustment to reflect transfer of certain
general officer billets from the Air Force to the Space
Force
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 526(a) of title 10, United States Code, to increase the author-
ized maximum number of Space Force brigadier generals by three
and reduce the authorized maximum number of Air Force brigadier
generals by three, in response to the transfer of responsibilities
from the Air Force to the Space Force.
Sec. 502—Notice of removal of Judge Advocates General
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 7037, 8088, and 9037 of title 10, United States Code, to re-
quire the Secretary of Defense to submit a minimum of 5 days no-
tice to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives that a Judge Advocate General is being
removed and a statement of the reason for the removal.
Sec. 503—Qualifications for judge advocates
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 806 of title 10, United States Code (Article 6 of the Uniform
Code of Military Justice), to require judge advocates to be admitted
to the practice of law before the highest court of a State, Territory,
Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia and to maintain an ac-
tive license to practice before such court, subject to the jurisdic-
tion’s disciplinary requirements and in compliance with such other
requirements as the cognizant authority has set to remain eligible
to practice law. The provision would also authorize the Judge Advo-
cates General of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, as
well as the Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine
Corps, to suspend the authority of judge advocates in their respec-
tive services to perform legal duties if such officers become non-
compliant with such requirements. The provision would also pro-
hibit any judge advocate or legal officer who is suspended or dis-
barred from the practice of law within a jurisdiction from per-
forming legal duties.
The committee notes the importance of judge advocates main-
taining baseline qualifications and competence in order to execute
their duties as legal professionals.

Sec. 504—Modification of waiver authority related to joint
qualified officer requirement prior to promotion to gen-
eral or flag grade
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 619a(b)(3) of title 10, United States Code, to remove the ex-
plicit authority of the Secretary of Defense to waive the require-
ment that an officer be joint qualified prior to promotion to general
or flag officer for officers in medical-related specialties. The com-
mittee notes that the Secretary will continue to have authority to
waive this requirement for the good of the service.
Sec. 505—Notification of removal of officers from selection
board reports and promotion lists
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 618, 629, and 14111 of title 10, United States Code, to require
notification to the Congress when officers are removed from selec-
tion board reports and lists for reasons other than misconduct.
Sec. 506—Space Force general officer management
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 525 and 526 of title 10, United States Code, to address the
composition of the Space Force without component as authorized by
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Pub-
lic Law 118–31).
Specifically, this provision would amend section 525 of title 10,
United States Code, to clarify that distribution limits apply only to
Space Force general officers serving on sustained duty orders and
to authorize up to two general officers to serve for more than 1
year but not more than 3 years in non-sustained duty roles without
counting against statutory limits.
Additionally, this provision would amend section 526 of title 10,
United States Code, to allow the Secretary of the Air Force to au-
thorize up to two general officers in active status to serve for a pe-
riod between 180 and 365 days in non-sustained duty roles and to
account for transitional periods for officers departing sustained
duty assignments so they are not counted against statutory limits.
Finally, this provision would add a new section 20110 to title 10,
United States Code, to authorize up to five Space Force general of-
ficers to serve in an active status but not on sustained duty.
Sec. 507—Temporary increase in fiscal year percentage limi-
tation for reduction or waiver of service-in-grade re-
quirement for general and flag officers to be retired in
pay grades O–7 and O–8
The committee recommends a provision that would temporarily
increase authorizations for general and flag officer time-in-grade
waivers for retirement.

Subtitle B—Reserve Component Management
Sec. 511—Expansion of authority to waive limitations on re-
lease of reserves from active duty within two years of
retirement eligibility
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 12686(b) of title 10, United States Code, to authorize a mem-
ber of a reserve component to waive the limitation on release from
active duty within 2 years of retirement eligibility when ordered to
active duty (other than for training) for up to 365 days, providing
greater flexibility for the services to effectively manage operational
needs without using active-duty funds for short-term requirements.
Sec. 512—Disestablishment of Navy Reserve Center system
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Navy or their designee to disestablish the Navy
Reserve Center system and return administrative readiness func-
tions to Navy reserve unit commanding officers or Navy reserve
community managers, as appropriate. Additionally, the provision
would direct the Secretary of the Navy or his or her designee to
reassign servicemembers assigned to the Navy Reserve Centers to
other duty assignments within the Navy or to transfer them to the
Individual Ready Reserve, as appropriate. This provision addresses
the changes in leadership roles within the Navy reserve system
and does not otherwise imply any limitations on the use for other
purposes of physical buildings currently being used for Navy re-
serve centers.
The committee is concerned that the Navy Reserve Center sys-
tem duplicates workforce requirements traditionally overseen by
Navy reserve unit commanders and thereby artificially inflates the
annual Navy reserve end-strength requirement. The committee
notes that this has resulted in a confusing, duplicative, and bifur-
cated chain of command that is contrary to Navy custom and tradi-
tion and to sound organizational management practices.
Moreover, the committee is aware of multiple instances where
Navy Reserve Centers have failed to perform basic readiness func-
tions for Navy reserve units, including by losing paperwork; assign-
ing additional administrative requirements to personnel that are
inconsistent with statute and regulation; refusing to perform unit
urinalysis; failing to respond to emails or complete administrative
processes related to essential personnel, pay, and mobilization ac-
tions; and being unaccountable to Navy reserve unit commanding
officers who have raised these issues with Navy Reserve Center
commanding officers.
Therefore, the committee is concerned that the Navy Reserve
Center system has resulted in inefficiency, increased costs, and an
overall decrease in mobilization readiness.
Sec. 513—National Guard personnel authorities
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary concerned to promulgate regulations to authorize an offi-
cer or warrant officer in the National Guard who fills a vacancy in
a federally recognized unit to be transferred from the active Na-
tional Guard to the inactive National Guard. The provision would

also allow such officers to transfer from the inactive National
Guard back into a federally recognized unit of the National Guard.
Sec. 514—National Guard personnel disaster response duty
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 3 of title 32, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of
Defense to authorize Governors to direct National Guard personnel
performing Active Guard and Reserve duty to conduct disaster re-
sponse duties under certain conditions for up to 14 days, while en-
suring that such duties do not interfere with primary responsibil-
ities.
Subtitle C—General Service Authorities and Military
Records
Sec. 521—Chief of Naval Personnel
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 8081 of title 10, United States Code, to require the Chief of
Naval Personnel to be responsible for the overall management,
oversight, and administration of Navy military and civilian employ-
ees.
Sec. 522—Enhanced efficiency and service discretion for
Disability Evaluation System reviews
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 524 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2022 (Public Law 117–81) to authorize the Secretaries of the mili-
tary departments to require a statement of contention as part of a
servicemember’s appeal of a physical evaluation board’s fitness for
duty determination. The provision would also allow the Secretaries
of the military departments to decide whether a formal appeal will
be reviewed through a records examination or an impartial appel-
late hearing. Additionally, the proposal would amend section 1214
of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Secretaries of the
military departments to require a statement of contention when a
servicemember requests a full and fair hearing before being retired
or separated due to physical disability.
Sec. 523—Technical correction related to convalescent leave
for academy cadets and midshipmen
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 702 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the provision
of convalescent leave to military service academy cadets and mid-
shipmen.
Sec. 524—Recognition of remotely piloted aircraft crew
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretaries of the military departments, in consultation with the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to establish a status identifier or
equivalent recognition to denote the combat participation of re-
motely piloted aircraft crew members who conduct operations in di-
rect support of combat missions.

Sec. 531—Notification of military sex offenders at military
installations
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish and implement a policy to ensure
that military-connected registered sex offenders are identified to
the military community where they work or live, including through
the use of agreements with State and local authorities. The policy
would be required not later than 1 year after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act.
The provision would also require the Secretary to assess the fea-
sibility and desirability of legislation designating the Department
of Defense as a jurisdiction under the Sex Offender Registration
and Notification Act (title 1 of Public Law 109–248).
Sec. 532—Quarterly reports on sexual assault prevention
and response efforts
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit a quarterly report on the activities,
progress, and performance metrics of the Sexual Assault Preven-
tion and Response Office.
Subtitle E—Member Education, Training, and Transition
Sec. 541—Military service academy nominations
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 7442(a), 8454, and 9442(a) of title 10, United States Code, to
clarify that Members of Congress may rank-order all persons that
a Member is permitted to nominate for appointment to a military
service academy.
Sec. 542—Asynchronous instruction in distance education
option for professional military education
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2154 of title 10, United States Code, to require that virtual
learning pathways in distance education programs under such sec-
tion must be offered asynchronously.
The committee notes that the mission of professional military
education programs within the Department of Defense is to train
military officers to operate as effective thinkers, strategists, plan-
ners, problem solvers, and operators in a joint warfighting environ-
ment. To the extent that the service war colleges offer a remote ad-
vanced degree program to fulfill this joint training requirement, in
order to ensure the effective administration of such a program for
reserve component personnel, the committee directs the services to
make use of modern best practices in remote graduate education by
including an asynchronous option for mandatory lecture course
components.

Secretary of Defense to designate an appropriate office within the
Department of Defense to manage the Secretary of Defense Stra-
tegic Thinkers Program (STP) and to provide annual briefings to
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on the administration of the STP, with the first
briefing to take place not later than January 12, 2026.
Sec. 545—Improvements to information-sharing to support
individuals retiring or separating from the Armed
Forces
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 570F of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2020 (Public Law 116–92) to strengthen information sharing with
State veterans agencies by establishing an opt-out framework.
Sec. 546—Mandatory training on government ethics and na-
tional security law
The committee recommends a provision that would require an-
nual training for members of the Armed Forces on ethics and
standards of conduct, as well as training for servicemembers on the
law of armed conflict, rules of engagement, defense support to civil
authorities, standing rules for the use of force, and the Code of
Conduct, as applicable, including within 90 days of a mobilization
or deployment.
Sec. 547—Prohibition on consideration of race, sex, color,
ethnicity, national origin, or religion in service academy
admissions decisions
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit mili-
tary service academies from considering race, sex, color, ethnicity,
national origin, or religion in admissions decisions.
Sec. 548—Prohibition on participation of males in athletic
programs or activities at the military service academies
that are designated for women or girls

Secretary of Defense to ensure that the military service academies
do not permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an ath-
letic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.

Sec. 551—Certain assistance to local educational agencies
that benefit dependents of military and civilian per-
sonnel
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize
$50.0 million in operation and maintenance, Defense-wide, for con-
tinuation of the Department of Defense (DOD) assistance program
to local educational agencies impacted by the enrollment of depend-
ent children of military members and DOD civilian employees. The
provision would also authorize $10.0 million in operation and main-
tenance, Defense-wide, for impact aid payments for children with
disabilities as enacted by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106–398), using
the formula set forth in section 363 of that Act, for continuation of
DOD assistance to local educational agencies that benefit eligible
dependents with severe disabilities. Furthermore, the provision
would authorize the Secretary of Defense to use an additional $20.0
million for payments to local educational agencies determined by
the Secretary to have higher concentrations of military children
with severe disabilities. Finally, the provision would require the
Secretary to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
September 30, 2026, on the Department’s evaluation of each local
educational agency with higher concentrations of military children
with severe disabilities and DOD’s subsequent determination of the
amounts of impact aid each such agency should receive.

assess the effectiveness of increasing compensation or other bene-
fits for employees of child development programs on military instal-
lations.
Sec. 559—Report on unmet need for childcare in areas with
significant populations of members of the Armed Forces
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, not later than September 30, 2027, to submit
a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives on the unmet need for childcare in
certain areas.
Part II—Other Matters
Sec. 561—Legal assistance for guardianship transfers
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretaries of the military departments to provide members of the
Armed Forces serving on active duty access to legal services pro-
vided by an attorney specializing in guardianship transfers in each
state in which a military installation is located. The provision
would also require the Secretaries of the military departments to

ate and the House of Representatives, not later than September 1,
2026, with: (1) An implementation plan to provide access to the
legal services required by the provision; (2) Any challenges associ-

Secretaries of the military departments consider relevant.
Subtitle G—Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps

more than 8 years of service before a former officer or noncommis-
sioned officer may be approved to serve as a Junior Reserve Offi-

tion 545(a) of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public
Law 118–159) to increase the number of required Junior Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps units to at least 3,600 and no more than
4,200.
Subtitle H—Decorations and Other Awards, Miscellaneous
Reports, and Other Matters
Sec. 581—Honorary promotions on the initiative of the De-
partment of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1563a of title 10, United States Code, to rescind the discretion
of the Secretary of Defense to make honorary promotions and au-
thorize the Secretaries of the military departments to make an
honorary promotion, including a posthumous honorary promotion,
if the honorary grade given to a servicemember is commensurate
with a servicemember’s contributions to the Armed Forces or the
national defense and if the Secretary of a military department re-
ceives a favorable recommendation by a board of at least three
independent officers convened specifically to review the proposed
honorary promotion. This authority shall not be used to award an
honorary promotion solely on the basis that a servicemember was
recommended for such promotion prior to separating from service.
The committee is concerned with potential misuse of the hon-
orary promotion authority. Honorary promotions are intended for
exceptional or unusual circumstances, rather than as preferential
treatment unrelated to service or exceptional circumstances.
Sec. 582—National Week of Military Recruitment
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-

of September as the National Week of Military Recruitment.
Sec. 583—Clarifying the calculation of enlistments for per-
sons whose score on the Armed Forces Qualification

ment events per academic year, across different grading periods.
This provision would also require secondary schools to provide di-
rectory information to military recruiters within 60 days of the
commencement of the academic year and thereafter within 30 days
of a recruiter request.
Sec. 585—Compliance with travel charge card deactivation
requirements

cause long-term impacts on affected individuals and that the De-
partment of Defense has a critical interest in protecting and caring
for the children of members of the Armed Forces.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, a report
assessing the feasibility and advisability of establishing an adverse
childhood experience response team program at the Department of
Defense to address adverse experiences associated with exposure to
trauma among children of members of the Armed Forces, to in-
clude:
(1) Establishing protocols to follow when encountering a
child of a member of the Armed Forces who has been exposed
to trauma to facilitate access to services;
(2) Developing referral partnership agreements with behav-
ioral health providers, substance treatment facilities, and re-
covery services for family members of children of members of
the Armed Forces who have been exposed to trauma;
(3) Integrating law enforcement, mental health, and crisis
services to respond to situations where such children have
been exposed to trauma;
(4) Implementing comprehensive programs and practices to
support such children;
(5) Identifying barriers for such children to access trauma-in-
formed care in their communities;
(6) Providing training in trauma-informed care to emergency
response providers, victim service providers, child protective
service professionals, educational institutions, and other com-
munity partners;
(7) Supporting cross-system planning and collaboration
among officers and employees who work in law enforcement,
court systems, child welfare services, correctional reentry pro-

grams, emergency medical services, health care services, public
health, and substance abuse treatment and recovery support;
(8) Providing technical assistance to communities, organiza-
tions, and public agencies on how to prevent and mitigate the
impact of exposure to trauma and violence;
(9) Integrating an adverse childhood experience response
team program into existing programs of the Department of De-
fense and assessing the impact on existing programs; and
(10) Providing a cost estimate for establishing such a pro-
gram and a timeline for implementation across the Depart-
ment.
Briefing on after-hours childcare options
The committee recognizes the ongoing challenges military fami-
lies face in securing high-quality childcare options, particularly
during non-traditional hours. Despite efforts to overcome the chal-
lenges, current initiatives to expand after-hours childcare are
struggling to meet the needs of servicemembers, especially those
stationed at remote or high-demand locations like Creech Air Force
Base.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Personnel and Readiness, in consultation with the Secre-
taries of the military departments, to brief the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 1, 2026, on Department of Defense efforts to
create and implement incentive programs that would encourage
Family Child Care (FCC) providers—typically military spouses—to
expand their services and provide additional childcare options for
military families. These programs should be designed to alleviate
the burden on servicemembers and their families by increasing the
availability of childcare during after-hours times and non-tradi-
tional times. The briefing should also include: (1) The feasibility
and advisability of increasing compensation or other benefits for
FCC providers to incentivize after-hours care; (2) An assessment of
existing barriers to expanding FCC providers, including resource
requirements; and (3) Recommendations for overcoming those bar-
riers, with special concern for remote installations or off-hours mis-
sion requirements.
Briefing on childcare exceptions to policy
The committee understands that servicemembers and their fami-
lies can experience extenuating circumstances or challenges that
may require a waiver from an installation commander for a de-
pendent to attend a Child Development Center (CDC) outside of
the normal priority system. Ideally, waivers to the priority list are
intended to be used rarely, for severe extenuating circumstances.
However, the lack of clear guidelines creates a risk of these excep-
tions being misused. The committee is not aware of any established
criteria for exceptions to policy, and the process or criteria for at-
taining an exception is not publicized.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 1, 2026, on: (1) The number of authorized exceptions

to the priority system for CDCs for the last two calendar years, de-
lineated by unique mission-related requirements or for standard
operations; (2) Any guidance provided to the components or instal-
lation commanders about when to grant exceptions to policy; (3)
Any guidance provided to servicemembers regarding the ability to
ask for an exception to policy; (4) Any guidance provided to CDC
Directors and Resource and Referral specialists regarding the exe-
cution of exceptions to policy; and (5) Any other matters relating
to exceptions to policy for CDC priority lists that the Secretaries
of the military departments deem necessary.
Briefing on general and flag officer reductions
Pursuant to the memorandum entitled ‘‘General/Flag Officer Re-
ductions,’’ dated May 5, 2025, the Secretary of Defense directed a
force-wide reduction in general and flag officers. In order to con-
duct congressional oversight on this matter, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than February 2, 2026.
This briefing should include, at a minimum: (1) Each military de-
partment’s methodology for identifying general and flag officer re-
ductions; (2) Expected force reduction outcomes by service; (3) De-
tailed implementation plans and timelines for each service; and (4)
An analysis of potential consolidation or grade reduction of the gen-
eral and flag officer positions assigned to joint duty assignments,
as well as all other general and flag officer positions currently ex-
empted from authorized strength by statute.
The Secretaries of the military departments and the Chief of the
National Guard Bureau should support the development of this
briefing and provide the necessary service-specific data and imple-
mentation plans to the Secretary of Defense in a timely manner.
Briefing on military recruits who participated in Junior Re-
serve Officers’ Training Corps
The committee notes that section 512 of the William M. (Mac)
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2021 (Public Law 116–283) expanded the purpose of Junior Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) programs to include ‘‘an introduc-
tion to service opportunities in military, national, and public serv-
ice.’’ This provision was based on a recommendation from the con-
gressionally chartered National Commission on Military, National,
and Public Service.
While not designed to be a military recruiting program, JROTC
has proven to be a valuable way to expose young Americans to the
virtues and benefits of military service. Yet, despite a general
awareness of the link between JROTC participation and military
recruiting, the Department of Defense has been reluctant to sys-
tematically track whether new military recruits have participated
in JROTC. This limits the ability of leaders in the Department and
in the Congress to gain valuable insights that may make JROTC
more effective.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than May 1, 2027, that

includes: (1) The number and percentage of military recruits in fis-
cal year 2026 who participated in the JROTC program; (2) An as-
sessment of the quality of recruits who participated in JROTC com-
pared to those who did not; and (3) An assessment of basic training
attrition rates of recruits who participated in JROTC compared to
those who did not.
Briefing on section 555 of Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2025
The committee notes that section 555 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) amended section
2154 of title 10, United States Code, to require the military serv-
ices to establish a pathway for members of the reserve component
to complete any distance education program offered to satisfy
Phase I or Phase II of joint professional military education (JPME),
as established under such section, in a virtual setting and without
having to attend in-person sessions.
The committee acknowledges and values in-person educational
settings, including for members of the reserve component enrolled
in JPME courses. However, the committee is aware of the many de-
mands placed on members of the reserve component who must bal-
ance their participation in rigorous JPME programs with the obli-
gations of their reserve component military duties, civilian occupa-
tions, and personal lives.
The committee notes that in many cases members of the reserve
component with the greatest civilian responsibilities are also lead-
ers who provide essential capabilities to the U.S. military during
times of armed conflict. Given limited resources and educational
technology that can offer incredible learning experiences in a re-
mote, asynchronous setting, inflexible JPME instructional modali-
ties should not become a barrier to advancement for high-per-
forming and high-potential military officers.
The committee believes that the military services must do more
to ensure that the many demands they place on members of the re-
serve component are prioritized and optimized to best fit the most
critical needs of the services. Section 555 was passed into law in
the spirit of that belief. However, the Army War College’s imple-
mentation of Section 555 has resulted in an inflexible virtual pro-
gram that requires real-time participation during the work day
throughout a two-week session when other students are present in
class, and only if approved by a general officer. This option offers
no real flexibility to members of the reserve component and results
in additional unnecessary bureaucratic barriers.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than January 31, 2026, on the
Army’s plan to fully implement section 555 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159). Such briefing shall
include the Army War College’s communications plan for ensuring
its students are aware of the statutory option to complete JPME
in a virtual setting, any policies or procedures associated with im-

plementing this provision, and any recommendations for policy
changes related to this law.
Careers in mapping and surveying
The committee recognizes the important role that mappers and
surveyors perform in American society. The committee encourages
the military departments to provide to members of the Armed
Forces who are enrolled in the Transition Assistance Program in-
formation and resources about follow-on civilian career opportuni-
ties with occupational specialties related to surveying and map-
ping. Furthermore, for such members seeking opportunities in the
Department of Defense’s SkillBridge program, the committee en-
courages the military departments to facilitate SkillBridge intern-
ship programs in mapping and surveying fields.
Cell phone-free Department of Defense Education Activity
schools
The committee acknowledges that the Joint Explanatory State-
ment to Accompany the Servicemember Quality of Life Improve-
ment and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025
(Public Law 118–159) contained a requirement for the Secretary of
Defense to provide the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives a briefing, not later than
July 1, 2025, on the use of cell phones within the academic envi-
ronment at Department of Defense Education Activity schools, in-
cluding an assessment of such use on student achievement. Civil-
ian school districts are increasingly trending toward prohibiting
cell phone use during school hours to limit student distractions,
with much success. The committee encourages the Secretary to
complete the required briefing by the required due date.
Clarity in communications for Exceptional Family Member
Program legal assistance
The committee understands that certain dependents of
servicemembers enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Pro-
gram experience challenges receiving proper special needs edu-
cational assistance when moving from one school to another. Sec-
tion 582 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) required
the military services to provide special education attorneys or legal
assistance to military families. The committee is aware that, while
the military services have implemented section 582, there is still
confusion at joint military installations about whether a service-
member in one service can receive legal assistance from another
military service.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than April 1, 2026,
on: (1) How each service manages special education legal assistance
at joint installations; (2) The level of support authorized by legal
assistance attorneys for special education matters; (3) Any barriers
to providing special education legal assistance to military depend-
ents at Department of Defense Education Activity schools; and (4)

Any relevant feedback or insight into the efficacy of the special

Comptroller General review of military service academy
curricula and staffing practices
The committee recognizes the importance of the U.S. Military
Academy, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy (here-
after referred to collectively as military service academies) in devel-
oping future military leaders. The military service academies pro-
vide a tuition-free, 4-year undergraduate education designed to
educate and graduate students with the knowledge and character
needed to lead as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces. While enrolled
at the military service academies, students are Active-Duty cadets
or midshipmen who live in military barracks, wear uniforms, and,
in addition to the academic curricula, participate in military train-
ing and professional development. The military service academies
employ a mixture of military and civilian faculty and staff to edu-
cate and train students in the required academic and practical
skills.
The committee is interested in how the military service acad-
emies ensure curricula and staffing practices remain current and
relevant to the dynamic environment into which their graduating
students will be entering.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to review the extent to which the military service
academies adapt their curricula and staffing strategies to meet
their respective missions. The review should provide a description
of current curricula at each military service academy and identify
trends in staffing, including the mix of military and civilians,
tenured faculty, and individuals with specializations or subject
matter expertise to provide needed curricula. The review should
also assess the extent to which the military service academies
have: (1) Implemented plans or processes for reviewing curricula to
ensure alignment with the strategic needs of the military; (2) Im-
plemented plans or processes to identify and address staffing
needs, including the determination of billet type and subject matter
expertise needed to support the administration of the curricula and
other strategic needs; (3) Modified their curricula and staffing to
adapt to changes to the strategic environment or in response to re-
cent related Executive Orders or other relevant guidance, as appro-
priate; and (4) Any additional issues that the Comptroller General
deems relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to brief
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than April 15, 2026, with the results of
the review to follow in a mutually agreed upon format and time-
frame.
Comptroller General review of military service compas-

of the family. In the committee report accompanying S. 4638 (S.
Rep. 118–188), the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2025, the committee directed the service secretaries to provide
a briefing on service reassignment policies under circumstances re-
lating to compassionate, humanitarian, or safety concerns of a serv-
icemember or military family.
The briefings provided by the services raise further questions
about the circumstances under which reassignment would be ap-
proved for personal hardship and under other circumstances of in-
justice or severe iniquity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a review of the military service compas-
sionate reassignment policies as described in the service responses
to S. Rep. 118–188 and to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than December 1, 2025, with a report to follow at an
agreed upon date.
Crew complement of F–15E and F–15EX programs
The committee recognizes the critical role that F–15E Weapon
System Officers (WSOs) have played in recent operations, including
their significant contributions to the successful downing of more
than 80 Iranian attack drones in April 2024. While the operational
environment was relatively permissive, the WSO’s ability to man-
age sensors, coordinate fires, and communicate with external agen-
cies was instrumental to mission success.
As the Air Force proceeds with the phased divestment of certain
F–15E aircraft and the procurement of the F–15EX platform, the
committee notes a lack of detail regarding how the Air Force in-
tends to retain and leverage its investment in the F–15E WSO
workforce. Furthermore, the committee is interested in under-
standing the range of options being considered for the employment
of officers operating in the F–15EX rear cockpit.
The committee is concerned that the Air Force has yet to clearly
define the primary mission profile for the F–15EX, whether it is in-
tended to be primarily an air-to-air or an air-to-ground platform.
This lack of strategic clarity complicates planning for crew require-
ments, training pipelines, and capability development. A firm deci-
sion is particularly critical given the F–15EX’s potential to support
advanced missions such as facilitating long-range kill chains, con-
ducting non-traditional command and control, contributing to elec-
tronic warfare missions, and conducting air-to-surface strike mis-
sions that may be more effectively executed with two crew mem-
bers.
The committee notes that potential tasks for an operator in the
rear cockpit of the F–15EX could include a wide range of mission-
enhancing functions such as operating advanced sensors, con-
ducting electronic warfare tasks, managing multi-domain command
and control responsibilities, and coordinating complex tactical sce-
narios in real time. These functions could increase overall mission
effectiveness of U.S. forces in contested and dynamic operational
environments.
Given the demonstrated value of the WSO in recent operations
and the evolving mission demands for the F–15EX, the committee

directs the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a report to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026. This
report should include: (1) An assessment of how any planned F–
15E divestitures may affect overall WSO career field manning re-
quirements; (2) The Air Force’s strategy for managing WSOs with
remaining service obligations in the context of F–15E divestiture;
(3) A description of current and potential future operational con-
cepts for the F–15EX, including how and when the rear cockpit
may be utilized across various mission profiles, including command
and control functions; (4) The extent to which rear-cockpit occu-
pants are necessary in F–15EX operations; (5) Any plans under
consideration to ensure sufficient personnel are available to sup-
port F–15EX operations that may require or benefit from a two-
crew configuration; and (6) A timeline for making a determination
on the F–15EX’s primary mission role and how that decision will
shape crew requirements and capabilities development.
Enhance Department of Defense science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics education and career-con-
nected pathways
The committee is encouraged by continued Department of De-
fense efforts to support the science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) ecosystem, including efforts under the De-
fense STEM Education Consortium and similar activities. These ac-
tivities support K–12, higher education, and workforce development
programs necessary to build a 21st century workforce with the
skills and talents to meet evolving defense challenges. The com-
mittee encourages the Department to ensure its activities include
career-connected learning, as well as research and evaluation ef-
forts, necessary to scale and adopt practices that can support mili-
tary-connected families.
Enhanced career counseling in Transition Assistance Pro-
gram
The committee acknowledges the critical role of the Transition
Assistance Program (TAP) in preparing servicemembers for transi-
tion to civilian life well in advance of their separation from service.
The committee also recognizes that the timelines prescribed by sec-
tion 1142 of title 10, United States Code, may conflict with the re-
tention efforts of the military services. The committee believes
servicemembers should be fully informed of all their career options,
including remaining in the active component, transitioning to the
reserves, or staying in the reserve component, as well as the com-
prehensive benefits of continued service.
The committee encourages the Department of Defense to inte-
grate retention specialists into the TAP curriculum to ensure
servicemembers are aware of their full range of options, including
continued active duty or reserve service, as well as the long-term
career and financial advantages of staying in uniform, alongside ci-
vilian employment opportunities. By adding retention specialists to
the pre-separation counseling brief and standardized TAP cur-
riculum, servicemembers will be better equipped to make informed
decisions, ultimately supporting both their career goals and overall
force readiness.

Ensuring statutory compliance in accession classification
and reporting
The committee is concerned about the Department of Defense’s
(DOD) current interpretation and implementation of section 520 of
title 10, United States Code, as it relates to the classification and
reporting of accession quality. Specifically, the Army’s practice of
reclassifying trainees who originally scored at or above the tenth
percentile and below the thirty-first percentile on the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT)—based on improved scores achieved dur-
ing the Future Soldier Preparatory Course—was made possible by
exceptions to policy granted by the Under Secretary of Defense for
Personnel and Readiness.
The committee notes that these exceptions contradict section 520
of title 10, United States Code, which requires that the AFQT score
used to determine compliance with statutory limitations must be
the score at the time of original enlistment—not a retest score.
This reinterpretation undermines transparency and congressional
oversight and should be discontinued. The committee understands
the value of the Future Servicemember Preparatory Course and ac-
knowledges that increases in AFQT should be reflected in a mili-
tary recruit’s profile and career options. Likewise, these higher
scores should be reflected in overall reporting and tracking of ac-
cessions data. However, the current practice is not consistent with
the law.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense and
the Secretaries of the military departments to track and report
both the original AFQT scores and the improved AFQT scores for
any recruits who attend the Future Servicemember Preparatory
Course for purposes of academic improvement. As of now, all acces-
sions data and analysis must include the AFQT score at the time
of original enlistment, in accordance with the law.
The committee strongly supports the services’ efforts to improve
recruit quality and expand opportunities for individuals who may
benefit from additional training. Nothing in this requirement pro-
hibits the continued use of preparatory courses or similar pro-
grams. In fact, the committee encourages the services to build on
the early successes of these initiatives. However, reporting and
classification must align with statutory definitions—specifically,
using the AFQT score recorded at the time of original enlistment,
in accordance with section 520 of title 10, United States Code.
Additionally, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Personnel and Readiness to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, not later than October 1, 2025. The briefing must in-
clude: (1) An updated response to the recommendations provided by
the DOD Inspector General’s May 1, 2025, report titled ‘‘Review of
the Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course’’; (2) Accurate acces-
sion quality data for each military service since the inception of the
Future Soldier Preparatory Course and the Future Sailor Pre-
paratory Course, based on AFQT scores at the time of enlistment;
(3) A plan to ensure full compliance with section 520 of title 10,
United States Code; (4) Any legislative or policy proposals that
would improve the Department’s ability to report accessions data
to reflect improvements in pre-basic training candidates who at-

Filling short-term servicemember childcare needs with
Kinderspot
The committee is aware that the Air Force has utilized a mobile
application called Kinderspot to help servicemembers find short-
term childcare needs on an installation. Kinderspot allows parents
to sublet their childcare spaces at Air Force Child Development
Centers (CDCs) when they do not need the spaces, connecting them
with other eligible servicemembers who may need short-term
childcare. Short-term childcare can often be a challenge for
servicemembers and their families. The committee commends the
Air Force for using Kinderspot, a Small Business Innovation Re-
search awardee, to provide military families additional flexible
childcare options. The other military services may benefit from a
similar capability. Therefore the committee directs the Secretaries
of the military departments to provide the Senate Armed Services
Committee a briefing, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1) The ex-
isting capabilities of each military service to allow for short-term
sublets of CDC spots; (2) Any resources necessary to create or uti-
lize a capability to allow short-term sublets of CDC spots; (3) Any
additional short-term childcare options the military services are
providing to servicemembers and their families; and (4) Any other
matters a Secretary determines to be relevant.
Implementation report on self-initiated mental health refer-
rals
The committee acknowledges and commends the Department of
Defense for its efforts to implement a self-initiated referral process
for mental health evaluations, as required by section 1090b(e) of
title 10, United States Code, across the active duty force and recog-
nizes the steps taken to expand access to mental health care. These
efforts reflect a growing commitment to reducing stigma and in-
creasing support for servicemembers in crisis.
However, the committee is concerned by reports of inconsistent
application of, and education and training on, this self-initiated re-
ferral process across active-duty units and applicable Reserve Com-
ponent troops on active-duty orders. The committee notes that, al-
though the military departments and services have made progress
in executing the law, more work is required to fully implement the
law, educate servicemembers on the policy, and ensure trans-
parency and accountability for those responsible for enforcing the
law.
Additionally, the committee is concerned that Phase II of the im-
plementation plan, to implement within the Reserve Component, to
include the Reserves and the National Guard, serving less than 30
consecutive days on active orders, has not yet occurred.
Therefore the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Personnel and Readiness, in coordination with the Secretaries
of the military departments and the Director of the Defense Health
Agency, to submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-

ment issued by the Secretary of Defense since May 5, 2023,

Code;
(2) Any memorandum or guidance issued by:
(a) the Department of the Navy since July 11, 2023 di-
recting the implementation of such process;
(b) the Department of the Air Force since July 28, 2023,
directing the implementation of such process; and
(c) the Department of the Army since August 29, 2023,
directing the implementation of such process;
(3) A description and timeline of any communications made
to members of the Armed Forces with respect to the implemen-
tation of such process;
(4) A description and timeline of efforts by the Secretary of
each military department to implement the annual training re-
quired under subsection (f) of such section; and
(5) A description and timeline of efforts to ensure that such
process reduces stigma in accordance with subsection (b) of
such section.
In addition, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Personnel and Readiness and each military department to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives biannually on implementation progress,
training effectiveness, and report adherence to section 1090b(e) of
title 10, United States Code. This biannual reporting requirement
should terminate on December 31, 2030.
Importance of independent legal advice by military judge
advocates
The committee notes that the ability to provide independent legal
advice is a fundamental principle in the military legal system and
is integral to the core values of military judge advocates. The com-
mittee further notes that judge advocates are military officers who
take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United
States. The committee believes that this oath cannot be upheld by
simply telling superior officers what they want to hear or by offer-
ing advice based on personal beliefs. Finally, the committee notes
that judge advocates are ethically required to provide candid advice
based on their independent legal judgement.
Accordingly, the committee affirms the value of the independent
legal advice of judge advocates.
Integration of military service outcome data with state edu-
cational systems
The committee recognizes the importance of understanding the
postsecondary outcomes of students who pursue military service
and the role this information can play in both enhancing military
readiness and informing educational policy and practice.

Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
consultation with the Secretary of Education and relevant stake-
holders, to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than May
1, 2026, on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a data
sharing system related to individual servicemember outcomes into
state educational agencies’ longitudinal data systems to enhance
military readiness and student success. Data elements to consider
should include, but should not be limited to, enlistment dates, mili-
tary occupational specialties, initial military rank, Armed Forces
Qualification Test scores, separation dates, and completion of ini-
tial training or credentialing programs. Such a briefing should in-
clude an assessment of any data or personal privacy concerns im-
plicated by such a data sharing system, the projected costs and re-
source requirements to establish such a system, and an assessment
of how such a system would enhance military recruiting efforts.
Navy Personnel Command Records Analysis Branch process
briefing
The committee is concerned about the lengthy response times
and challenges receiving accurate information when inquiries to
the Navy Personnel Command’s Records Analysis Branch are sub-
mitted by Members of Congress on behalf of their constituents.
There have been significant challenges to receiving accurate up-
dates on constituent cases and receiving adjudications in a timely
manner. In certain circumstances, it appears that records may be
misplaced during the process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a briefing, not later than July 1, 2026, to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
describing the existing process within Navy Personnel Command’s
Records Analysis Branch designed to expedite congressional inquir-
ies and cases to and from the Board for Correction of Naval
Records. The briefing should also include: (1) Data on the Navy
Personnel Command’s Records Analysis Branch response times
over the previous 5 years; (2) The average time to close cases, in-
cluding those initiated through congressional inquiries, as well as
the average time to issue final determinations on all cases; and (3)
The response times for cases that require records after receipt of
the record from the National Personnel Records Center, specifically
highlighting the length of time to receive records.
Oversight of suicide prevention policy and access to mental
health care
The committee remains concerned about the persistent rates of
suicide among servicemembers and believes suicide prevention
must remain a top priority for the Department of Defense and the
military services. While the Department has made notable invest-
ments in prevention, response, and resiliency efforts, the committee
continues to have concerns regarding consistency and coordination
of policies across the services.
The committee emphasizes the importance of sustaining momen-
tum in suicide prevention by ensuring that servicemembers are
fully aware of, and empowered to utilize, available mental health

resources. The committee is particularly concerned about perceived
or actual barriers to self-referral for mental health care and en-
courages the Department to evaluate policies, procedures, and unit-
level cultures that may discourage servicemembers to seek needed
care.
The committee supports the Department’s continued efforts to
improve the quality, accessibility, and visibility of suicide preven-
tion resources. However, the success of these initiatives depends on
clear leadership, accountability, transparent data sharing, and a
servicemember’s ability to access care without stigma or delay. The
committee expects the Department to maintain robust oversight
and ensure timely implementation of suicide prevention rec-
ommendations, particularly those of the Suicide Prevention and Re-
sponse Independent Review Committee.
Potential school choice options for Department of Defense
Education Activity
The committee notes that the January 29, 2025, Executive Order
Number 14191 ‘‘Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity
for Families,’’ required the Secretary of Defense to review available
mechanisms under which military-connected families may use
funds from the Department of Defense to attend schools of their
choice, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools. The
Executive Order further directed the Secretary to submit a plan to
the President describing such mechanisms and the steps that
would be necessary to implement them beginning in the 2025–2026
school year.
Accordingly, not later than 30 days after the publication of this
report, the committee directs the Secretary to provide to the con-
gressional defense committees a whole and identical copy of the
plan that the Secretary submitted to the President.
Preservation of the Force and Family program
The committee strongly supports U.S. Special Operations Com-
mand’s (SOCOM) Preservation of the Force and Families (POTFF)
program and recognizes its vital role in sustaining the readiness of
special operations forces by building resilience and optimizing per-
formance. The committee notes that SOCOM utilizes its Human
Performance Data Management System to improve its data collec-
tion, governance, and management. In an effort to ensure SOCOM
provides clear guidance on achieving an integrated and holistic
care system for POTFF, the committee encourages SOCOM to con-
tinue these efforts and seek opportunities to enhance its use of
data to optimize support through the POTFF program.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the
Commander, SOCOM, to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than October 1, 2025, detailing ongoing efforts to fully uti-
lize the Human Performance Data Management System.
Recognition of military-friendly schools

among young Americans. Accordingly, the committee directs the
Secretary of Defense to assess the feasibility and advisability of
recognizing high schools with military enlistment rates above their
state average. As part of this assessment, the Secretary should
evaluate potential criteria for recognition, the likely impact of such
a designation on enlistment rates and school culture, and options
for implementation, including, but not limited to, issuing a formal
letter of recognition from the Secretary to each qualifying school.
The committee further directs the Secretary to submit a report to
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than April 1, 2026, outlining proposed
criteria for recognition, the anticipated impact of recognizing mili-
tary-friendly schools, and recommendations for implementation or
expansion.
Report on human performance technologies
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a re-
port to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than July 1, 2026, on opportu-
nities to improve collaboration across the military departments in
the development, integration, and coordination of human perform-
ance technologies that support warfighter readiness.
The report should focus specifically on technological tools and
systems—such as wearable devices, performance tracking software,
cognitive enhancement tools, and other physical or digital tech-
nologies—designed to improve physical, cognitive, nutritional, psy-
chological, and sleep readiness.
The report should include: (1) Opportunities to align require-
ments development, resource sharing, and best practices for human
performance technologies across the military departments; (2)
Mechanisms to improve coordination of service-specific human per-
formance efforts, including data interoperability, shared research
priorities, and program evaluation standards; (3) An assessment of
the utility of existing or potential collaborative structures—such as
cross-service working groups or cross-functional teams—to support
enterprise-level integration of human performance technologies
without establishing a centralized governing authority; and (4) An
assessment on how data collected through such technologies is pro-
tected against misuse, including the sale or unauthorized transfer
of sensitive servicemember information to third-party data brokers,
as highlighted in recent research on risks to military personnel pri-
vacy.
For the purposes of this report, ‘‘human performance tech-
nologies’’ refers to tools and systems that enhance performance in
domains such as physical fitness, cognitive function, mental resil-
ience, sleep health, and nutrition, as described in the Army’s Octo-
ber 1, 2020, Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) Operating Concept.
Report on implementation of notification requirements re-
lating to prohibition on post-service employment with

quires the Secretary of Defense to establish a process under which
each member of the Armed Forces, before the member retires or is
otherwise separated from the Armed Forces, is: (1) Informed in
writing of the prohibition, and the penalties for violations of the
prohibition; and (2) Required to certify that the member under-
stands the prohibition and those penalties.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit a briefing, not later than January 12, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on the efforts of the Department of Defense (DOD) to imple-
ment the requirement to inform members of the Armed Forces with
respect to this prohibition. The briefing should include information
on the following: (1) The manner in which the DOD has imple-
mented a process for providing the required notification to each
member of the Armed Forces; (2) Any assessment the Department
has made on its ability to provide adequate notification in writing
with respect to the prohibition and the penalties for violations of
the prohibition; (3) The progress the Department has made in ob-
taining the certification required from each member of the Armed
Forces before the member retires or otherwise separates from the
Armed Forces; and (4) Any recommended changes to policies, proce-
dures, or resources to improve the ability of the Department to pro-
vide adequate notification with respect to the prohibition.
Report on public service loan forgiveness
In section 559B of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improve-
ment and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025
(Public Law 118–159), the Congress directed the Department of De-
fense and Department of Education to, within 1 year, implement
a data match enabling servicemembers to automatically receive
credit for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to publish on a publicly available
website of the Department of Defense a report on the efforts of the
Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Education to implement

Section 8:
section 559B. The report shall include, but not be limited to, infor-
mation on: (1) How many servicemembers, disaggregated by active-
duty servicemembers and civilians, had received PSLF before im-
plementation of the data match; (2) How many servicemembers to
date have received PSLF through the data match; and (3) Whether
the data match has been completed and, if not, the agencies’ efforts
to complete the data match to date. The report shall be submitted
by March 1, 2026, and shall be submitted quarterly until the data
match has been completed.
Report on training records for post-9/11 servicemembers
The committee remains concerned about the transition of
servicemembers from military service to civilian life. In section 574
of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–
159), the Congress required the Secretaries of the military depart-
ments to provide training and competency records that reflect a
plain-language description of the training, courses, certifications,
and qualifications of separating servicemembers to facilitate such
servicemembers’ prospects of finding well-matched civilian employ-

ment. The committee is aware that many veterans who have al-
ready separated from service would also benefit from such records.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Personnel and Readiness to provide a report to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than May 1, 2026, on the feasibility and advisability of
providing training and competency records to members of the
Armed Forces who served on or after September 11, 2001.
Service casualty assistance office resourcing and capacity
The committee is aware that the military service casualty assist-
ance offices have many significant and sensitive responsibilities,
one of which is to support the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agen-
cy (DPAA) with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Family Reference
Sample (FRS) collection. Through their respective Secretary of a
military department, service casualty assistance offices are respon-
sible for conducting genealogy searches to determine the primary
next of kin of missing servicemembers and appropriate DNA FRS
donors and to collect family artifacts and other material as re-
quired for DNA analysis. Once collected, the DPAA and the Armed
Forces Medical Examiner System’s Armed Forces DNA Identifica-
tion Laboratory compares the FRS against DNA extracted from re-
covered remains to identify missing servicemembers. The com-
mittee understands that some of the military services are under-
resourced for this important purpose, which then limits the work
that the DPAA can do to identify recovered remains in their care.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, on: (1) The existing resources for each military services’ cas-
ualty assistance office for the functions they are required to per-
form, with a specific delineation for the genealogy work and FRS
collection to support the DPAA; (2) An assessment from the mili-
tary services regarding the additional resources required to remove
any limitation on genealogy caseload to expand efforts to support
DPAA; (3) Any additional resources or authorities that would assist
the military service casualty assistance offices with their existing
responsibilities; and (4) Any other matters the Secretaries deter-
mine relevant.
Study on the readiness and transition impacts of the
SkillBridge program
The committee recognizes the need for greater support to our
servicemembers as they transition out of the U.S. military. The
SkillBridge program is a valuable opportunity for servicemembers
to gain civilian work experience through specific industry training,
apprenticeships, or internships during the last days of service to
better prepare them for life outside of service. The committee also
understands that use of this program depends on commanders’ as-
sessment of unit readiness and their acceptance of risk to allow for
participation.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a one-time report to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,

2026, on the effectiveness of the SkillBridge program by providing
empirical data and analysis. This report will include:
(1) The total amount of individuals who apply and enroll in
the SkillBridge program (broken out by rank, specialty, and
length of time);
(2) The application and participation rates across different
military branches and what branch-specific policies or cultural
factors contribute to the differences;
(3) The specialties and ranks that benefit the most and least
from SkillBridge participation;
(4) The total amount of individuals who have been denied
participation based on readiness concerns (both before and
after branch-specific restriction policy enactment);
(5) How mission readiness has been affected by participa-
tion;
(6) How the program has affected transition outcomes meas-
ured by hiring rates from SkillBridge companies and, of those,
how many are employed by their SkillBridge program company
or in similar fields;
(7) A list of the companies and industries that participate;
(8) The number and percentage of participants who gain em-
ployment after completion of the program;
(9) A list of the barriers that are preventing commanders
from making accurate readiness risk assessments for their
units under the current SkillBridge program; and
(10) Steps to be taken to ensure the services properly bal-
ance the best possible transition outcomes for all
servicemembers and readiness.
Summer camp programs for military-connected youth
The committee recognizes the challenges faced by children of
servicemembers, including the disruptions caused by frequent relo-
cations and extended deployments. These factors can impact chil-
dren’s emotional and psychological well-being, affecting family sta-
bility and military readiness. To mitigate these challenges, the
committee encourages the Department of Defense to explore ways
in which it can support summer camp programs designed specifi-
cally for military-connected youth.
These camps provide a structured, supportive environment in
which children can develop resilience, build peer networks, and ac-
quire life and leadership skills. Furthermore, summer camps foster
a sense of identity and connection to military life among children
of servicemembers, which increases their propensity to serve in the
military themselves. A significant portion of future military per-
sonnel come from military families, and these programs play a cru-
cial role in inspiring the next generation to serve. The committee
urges the Department to prioritize programs that integrate mental
health support; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
education; and leadership development for all eligible families.

TITLE VI—COMPENSATION AND OTHER
PERSONNEL BENEFITS
Subtitle A—Pay and Allowances
Sec. 601—Modifications to calculation of basic allowance for
subsistence for enlisted members
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 402 of title 37, United States Code, to simplify the calculation
of basic allowance for subsistence and ensure the allowance shall
not decrease from year to year. Additionally, the provision would
update the calculation and amount payable of basic allowance for
subsistence in the case of a member subject to monthly deductions
from pay for meals provided by essential station messing.
Sec. 602—Inclusion of descriptions of types of pay on pay
statements
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to ensure that pay statements for
servicemembers include clear, plain-language descriptions for each
type of pay, allowance, and deduction. Additionally, the provision
would require that the descriptions must cover the legal authority,
purpose, eligibility criteria, and potential changes to each item.
They must be easily accessible on the pay statement and written
in language that is understandable to those without specialized
knowledge of military finance. This requirement would take effect
180 days after the bill is enacted.
Sec. 603—Increased awareness and improved calculation of
rates for basic allowance for housing
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to publish a clear, accessible document that
explains how basic allowance for housing rates are determined, in-
cluding methodology and types of data sources used. This informa-
tion would also be provided directly to servicemembers upon any
event that may impact their basic allowance for housing and shall
include an explanation of the type of rental housing their basic al-
lowance for housing is intended to support in each locality.
This provision would require the Secretary of Defense to develop
an alternative methodology for calculating basic allowance for
housing, based on the typical cost of housing units by number of
bedrooms rather than solely on pay grade and dependent status,
incorporating both available and verified occupied rental market
data. Once developed, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct a pilot
program using the new methodology, setting notional rates for the
basic allowance for housing for calendar years 2026 and 2027 for
a minimum of 10 military housing areas.

The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2027, that
includes: (1) A comparison of the notional rates with the actual
rates for basic allowance for housing for 2026 and 2027; (2) A com-
parison of the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology
and the use of setting each such rates; (3) A determination of
whether the alternative methodology is more or less likely than the
current methodology to ensure that rates for basic allowance for
housing are set based upon a 95 percent statistical confidence that
the estimated median rent is within 10 percent of the actual me-
dian rent in local military housing areas; (4) A comparison of cost
estimates for 2027 using both methodologies; (5) An identification
of any additional legislative authority required to fully implement
the new methodology; and (6) The recommendation of the Secretary
with respect to whether to implement the use of the new method-
ology and the timing for such implementation.
Sec. 604—Military compensation educational campaign
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to initiate a 12-month educational campaign,
not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,
to improve knowledge and understanding of pay and benefits by
servicemembers and military families. The campaign would cover
key topics, including: (1) Elements of regular military compensa-
tion as defined in section 101(25) of title 37, United States Code;
(2) Special and incentive pays; (3) Retirement pay calculations; (4)
Educational assistance programs and benefits; (5) Healthcare for
Active-Duty members and their families; and (6) Nonmonetary ben-
efits.
Subtitle B—Special and Incentive Pay
Sec. 611—Reviews of designations of imminent danger pay
areas
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a review of each area designated
by section 351(a)(3) of title 37, United States Code, as imminent
danger pay. This review should validate that each area is one in
which a member is subject to imminent danger of physical injury
due to threat conditions. Not later than 60 days after each review,
a report shall be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, including any
changes to designations resulting from the review. The initial re-
view and report shall be conducted not later than March 1, 2026,
and subsequent reviews and reports shall be conducted not less
than every 5 years thereafter. If, at any time between the submis-
sions of required reviews and reports, the Secretary of Defense or
the Secretary of a military department conducts a review of des-
ignated areas and makes a change to any such designation, that
Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the review
and the change not later than 60 days after the change is made.

tion 602(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) to require the Secretary of Defense
to assess aviation incentive pay programs across the services for ef-
fectiveness, consistency, and alignment with retention and readi-
ness needs, and to begin payments based on that assessment.
Sec. 613—Pilot program on improving retention of members
with degrees in their fields of specialty
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a pilot program to assess the fea-
sibility and advisability of paying incentive pay to enlisted mem-
bers of the Armed Forces with degrees in their fields of specialty
to improve the retention of such members.
Subtitle C—Other Matters
Sec. 621—Extension of enhanced authority for selective
early retirement and early discharges
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 638a(a)(2) of title 10, United States Code, to extend the en-
hanced authority for selective retirement and early discharges until
December 31, 2030.
Sec. 622—Extension of temporary early retirement authority

Sec. 628—Prohibition on procurement and commissary sales
of seafood originating or processed in the People’s Re-
public of China
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Department of Defense from procuring seafood originating or proc-
essed in the People’s Republic of China for use in military dining
facilities and from selling such seafood in commissary stores.
Items of Special Interest
Analysis of outsourcing Defense Commissary Agency func-
tions for enhanced efficiency
The committee recognizes the critical role commissaries play in
supporting military families by providing access to affordable gro-
ceries, particularly in high-cost and geographically remote areas.
The committee seeks to explore opportunities to improve effi-
ciencies within the system without compromising this core benefit.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
seek to enter into a contract with a federally funded research and
development center to conduct a simulation and evaluation of out-
sourcing Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) functions for en-
hanced efficiency.
The simulation should evaluate: (1) Whether a commercial gro-
cery retailer can consistently deliver a 25 percent savings benefit
to commissary patrons across 235 global locations without the use
of congressional appropriations; and (2) Whether DeCA could sus-
tain operations in remote and overseas locations under any pro-
posed model, given that these sites often depend on cross-subsidies
from higher-revenue commissaries to remain viable.
Additionally, the simulation should analyze a representative
sample of commissary sites, considering factors such as: (1) Geo-
graphic diversity; (2) Patron demographics; (3) Existing savings
rates; and (4) The availability of alternative grocery options.

Particular attention should be paid to rural and overseas loca-
tions, where the commissary benefit is more essential and where
market conditions may limit the feasibility of commercial replace-
ment.
Further, the simulation should explore various contracting op-
tions to improve efficiency while preserving core benefits, but with-
out a presumption that any model would be better than the current
structure. It must also account for the DeCA’s current business
model, in which revenue generated from larger U.S.-based stores is
used to subsidize operations at rural and overseas commissaries.
To the extent possible, the simulation should incorporate input
from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel
and Readiness, defense resale organizations, and relevant industry
stakeholders. The simulation must require that any future busi-
ness model for operating commissary stores would maintain a min-
imum patron savings rate of no less than 25 percent.
Finally, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide
a report of the simulation to the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than Janu-
ary 1, 2027, addressing the feasibility, metrics, and costs of oper-
ating commissary stores through contracted vendor services. The
report should cover, at a minimum: (1) Methods of selection for lo-
cations to be analyzed for contracted services; (2) Market research
on commercial grocery chains that express interest in participating
in contracted commissary operations; (3) The costs and liabilities
incurred by the Government, including the military services, mili-
tary installations, and the DeCA, that would result from operating
commissary stores through contracted vendors; (4) Potential im-
pacts on military family quality of life, morale, and retention, par-
ticularly in high-cost or geographically isolated locations; (5) An
evaluation of the potential impacts on current DeCA employees; (6)
A risk assessment, as well as proposed contingency measures, to
ensure uninterrupted access to affordable groceries for eligible pa-
trons; and (7) Recommendations for specific administrative or legis-
lative action that the Secretary considers appropriate to modernize
and improve the delivery of the commissary benefit.
Briefing on adequacy of cost of living allowances calcula-
tions
The committee notes that the 14th Quadrennial Review of Mili-
tary Compensation highlighted a concern regarding the current liv-
ing pattern survey, which is used to determine cost of living allow-
ances both in the continental United States and overseas. The re-
port indicates that this survey may lead to discrepancies in allow-
ance rates for areas that are geographically close due to variations
in shopping behaviors. This raises concerns about the survey’s ac-
curacy in reflecting the actual purchasing habits of
servicemembers. Additionally, there may be significant differences
between the commissary usage reported in the survey and actual
sales data from commissaries.
In response to these findings, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to brief the Senate Armed Services Committee,
not later than February 15, 2026. The briefing should assess the
effectiveness of the living pattern survey in determining cost of liv-

ing allowances. This assessment should include an analysis of any
discrepancies between the survey data and annual commissary
usage statistics, as well as recommendations for more accurate
methods of calculating cost of living allowances, particularly
through a better understanding of Department of Defense com-
missary and exchange utilization.
Briefing on separation and retirement policies of certain
members of the Armed Forces
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a brief-
ing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, by not later than February 1, 2026, as-
sessing the Department of Defense’s implementation of the Sec-
retary’s February 7, 2025, memorandum entitled ‘‘Prioritizing Mili-
tary Excellence and Readiness’’ and the May 8, 2025, Secretary of
Defense memorandum entitled ‘‘Implementing Policy on
Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness.’’ The briefing
should include: (1) The processes for determining affected
servicemembers; (2) The number and grades of affected
servicemembers; (3) The number of requests for an exception to
policy with respect to retirement or separation; (4) The number of
requests so granted or denied; and (5) The overall impact of imple-
mentation on the readiness of the Armed Forces.
Commending the United Service Organizations
The committee recognizes the invaluable role the United Service
Organizations (USO) has played in supporting American
servicemembers for over 80 years, particularly in the face of rapidly
evolving global security challenges. In the wake of the Israel-
Hamas conflict in October 2023, the committee understands that
the USO adjusted its operations to meet the increased demands for
support across the Middle East. Due to the threat level in the re-
gion, many deployed servicemembers did not have access to their
normal recreation activities. In response, the USO significantly ex-
panded its own in-person and virtual offerings to ensure that those
serving in the region were supported with the necessary resources
to maintain morale and connection to their families.
The committee understands that the USO has also broadened its
outreach to other critical regions, including the Indo-Pacific, east-
ern Europe, Africa, and aboard Navy ships deployed worldwide.
Notably, the USO measured an 11 percent increase in visits to its
centers in 2024, tracking 11.3 million interactions with
servicemembers and their families, and will open new brick-and-
mortar centers in Singapore and Louisiana in 2025. In 2023, the
USO launched the first USO Center aboard a Navy ship, the USS
George H. W. Bush (CVN 77), and has since expanded this initia-
tive to seven additional aircraft carriers including the USS Dwight
D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), USS George Washington (CVN 73), USS
Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), USS Ger-
ald R. Ford (CVN 78), USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), and USS
Ronald Reagan (CVN 76). Working with the Navy, the USO plans
to open centers on two additional carriers in 2025 as well as all
new Ford-class carriers as they are completed, per Navy’s request
for the expansion of this successful pilot program.

Accordingly, the committee encourages robust funding for the
USO to ensure that it can continue to meet the ever-evolving needs
of servicemembers and their families.
Development of regular military compensation pay table
The committee recognizes the importance of clearly commu-
nicating the full value of military compensation to servicemembers,
their families, and the public. While the Department of Defense
(DOD) currently publishes basic pay tables annually, these tables
do not fully reflect the comprehensive nature of regular military
compensation (RMC), which includes not only basic pay but also
basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, retire-
ment benefits, educational assistance, medical insurance, and the
associated federal tax advantages.
To enhance transparency and better inform servicemembers
about their total compensation package, the committee directs the
Secretary of Defense to develop an annual regular military com-
pensation pay table that presents the total estimated value of RMC
across all ranks and years of service. The pay table should include
explanatory materials to help servicemembers understand the full
scope of their compensation.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than February 1,
2026, outlining the methodology used to calculate the RMC figures,
including assumptions related to housing location, dependency sta-
tus, and tax treatment. The briefing should provide a sample of the
aforementioned annual regular military compensation pay table
that presents the total estimated value of RMC across all ranks
and years of service. The briefing also should address the advis-
ability and feasibility of publishing the RMC pay table annually
alongside the basic pay table and should describe the steps the
DOD would take to effectively communicate this information to the
force.
Exempted positions from Deferred Resignation Program
The committee recognizes the importance of maintaining a mis-
sion-ready civilian workforce within the Department of Defense
(DOD) and ensuring that critical positions are not adversely im-
pacted by workforce reduction initiatives. The committee recognizes
that the Deferred Resignation Program as implemented in the De-
partment of Defense permitted voluntary workforce reductions and
included mission essential exemptions.
The committee is aware that certain categories of personnel, in-
cluding military personnel, have been historically exempted from
similar programs and that Title 32 Dual Status Technicians play
a critical role in maintaining the readiness of National Guard for-
mations. Given the urgency of exemption requests submitted by the
National Guard Bureau and the time-sensitive nature of the pro-
gram, the committee is concerned about the lack of clarity regard-
ing the positions that have been formally exempted by DOD leader-
ship.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate

and the House of Representatives, not later than December 1,
2025, detailing all positions and occupational categories granted ex-
emptions from the Deferred Resignation Program. This report
should include: (1) A comprehensive list of all exempted positions,
including pay plan, occupational series, grade, and title; (2) The
justification provided for each exemption; and (3) The process by
which exemption requests were reviewed and approved.
Military housing price setting software report
The committee is concerned about landlords’ potential collusion
and use of price-setting algorithms to artificially raise rents to
pocket basic allowance for housing (BAH) increases. The committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a report to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, by not later than March 1, 2026, on the Department of De-
fense’s plan to strengthen oversight into the potential use of algo-
rithmic pricing in military communities. The report should include
information on the extent to which landlords in military commu-
nities utilize price-setting software, including RealPage, to set
apartment rents paid by servicemembers using BAH.
Report on student loan challenges for servicemembers
The student loan landscape has shifted significantly in recent
years, including for servicemembers. The committee directs the
Comptroller General of the United States to review the student
loan repayment challenges of servicemembers. This review should
address: (1) What challenges servicemembers face in student loan
repayment, including challenges related to recent changes in repay-
ment procedures, third-party scams, and servicer misconduct; (2)
How federal agencies help servicemembers navigate these chal-
lenges; and (3) Any recommendations for the Congress and Federal
agencies to address these challenges. The committee further directs
the Comptroller General to periodically brief the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on
the status of this review and publish a report on the review not
later than March 1, 2026.
Use of surcharge funds for Defense Commissary infrastruc-
ture
The committee supports efforts to modernize, maintain, and im-
prove commissary facilities in order to ensure continued access to
affordable, high-quality groceries for servicemembers and their
families. The committee recognizes the importance of sustained in-
vestment in commissary infrastructure and acknowledges the role
that surcharge revenues can play in enabling these improvements.
To inform future decisions regarding the most appropriate and
effective use of surcharge proceeds in support of commissary sys-
tem infrastructure, and to ensure long-term sustainability of the
benefit, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit
a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than January 1, 2026, that
includes: (1) An explanation of how current authorities under title
10, United States Code, particularly section 2484, are being used
to support the repair, maintenance, improvement, or modernization

along with the rationale for such changes; and (3) A summary of
how the Department would prioritize the use of surcharge funds,
if such additional funds are authorized for various facility-related
needs—including maintenance, repair, upgrades, or new construc-
tion—to ensure cost-effectiveness, alignment with operational re-
quirements, and equitable access for beneficiaries.

Items of Special Interest
Access to obstetrician-gynecologist care
The committee has heard concerns about the availability of ob-
stetrician-gynecologist medical care available to TRICARE bene-
ficiaries, including servicemembers, at Fort Drum, New York. The
committee therefore directs the Secretary of Defense to brief the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than December 1, 2025, on the adequacy
and sufficiency of obstetrician-gynecologist care available to
TRICARE beneficiaries in the vicinity of Fort Drum, New York.
The briefing shall include: (1) An overview of the administrative
and cost barriers to expanding obstetrician-gynecologist care in the
Watertown, New York area; (2) An assessment of the feasibility
and advisability of expanding obstetrician-gynecologist care avail-
able at Fort Drum, New York; and (3) Any other relevant matters
that the Secretary deems appropriate.
Anomalous health incidents
The committee continues to strongly support the work of the De-
partment of Defense’s cross-functional team for addressing the
threats posed by emerging directed energy weapons, including
those that could plausibly result in anomalous health incidents
(AHI), and believes the efforts of the cross-functional team have

significantly advanced the Department’s understanding of the
threats these technologies pose to U.S. military, intelligence, and
other personnel. The committee believes the cross-functional team
has been an important and independent contributor to interagency
consideration of these issues.
The committee encourages the Department to continue to provide
the cross-functional team with adequate resources to continue its
efforts, particularly with respect to providing treatment for those
affected by AHIs and ensuring timely compensation under the
Helping American Victims Affected by Neurological Attacks Act of
2021 (Public Law 117–46). Lastly, the committee encourages the
Department, via the cross-functional team, to redouble efforts to
characterize emerging directed energy threats, understand their or-
igin, and develop countermeasures.
However, the committee is concerned that the Defense Health
Program budget request cuts AHI research and seeks to eliminate
the stand-alone project code. The committee strongly encourages
the Department to ensure robust funding for this force protection
research in fiscal year 2027.
Biologic vascular repair for warfighters
The committee notes that recent advancements in biologic vas-
cular repair technology, successfully deployed to front-line hospitals
in active conflict zones and austere environments, have resulted in
Food and Drug Administration-approved innovations that present
new opportunities to enhance care for servicemembers with vas-
cular injuries sustained on the battlefield. These regenerative med-
icine technologies are off-the-shelf, universally implantable, dem-
onstrate low susceptibility to infection, and can mitigate challenges
associated with traditional vascular repair methods.
Therefore, the committee encourages the Joint Trauma System
(JTS) to evaluate and, if advisable, incorporate these innovations
into the standard protocol in military trauma care. In particular,
the JTS should evaluate these advancements for use in treating ex-
tremity arterial injury when urgent revascularization is needed to
avoid imminent limb loss and when autologous vein graft is not
feasible.
Blast overpressure data modernization
The committee notes section 724 of the Servicemember Quality
of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) included a provision to ad-
dress servicemember brain health and directed the Secretary of De-
fense to establish roles and responsibilities central to the docu-
mentation of blast overpressure exposure. The committee believes
the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to capture, protect, store, and
disseminate information regarding blast overpressure and trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) in training and operational environments
is critical to ensure the health and readiness of servicemembers
and provide decision support to leaders across the care continuum.
The committee supports the ongoing efforts by the Defense
Health Agency (DHA) to modernize data and analytical capabilities
to support healthcare across the Military Health System through
the Digital Front Door initiative. Therefore, the committee directs

of AI and data modernization capabilities, facilitating the dissemi-
nation of information regarding blast overpressure and TBI in ac-
cordance with the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public
Law 118–159).
Briefing on feasibility of Department of Defense partnership
with non-profit academic medical center to study trau-
matic brain injury
The committee continues to be concerned about emerging infor-
mation indicating the detrimental whole-health impact of repeated
blast overpressure exposure on members of the Armed Forces. Re-
search has shown an association between blast exposure and al-
tered brain structure, compromised brain function, and numerous
medical comorbidities impacting both physical and psychological
health. Those negative health impacts are pointing to early
maladaptive aging that impacts force readiness and long-term
health. In the post-9/11 conflicts, there has been a surge in train-
ing-related demands and combat exposures for members of the
Armed Forces, in particular among members serving in special op-
erations units.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than June 1, 2026, on
the feasibility and advisability of conducting a longitudinal medical
study with a non-profit academic medical center that specializes in
traumatic brain injury and has documented experience working
with special operations personnel on traumatic brain injury, includ-
ing medical comorbidity evaluation and treatment, to analyze spe-
cial operations personnel health data.
Briefing on telehealth-enabled solutions for treatment of
musculoskeletal injuries
The committee is aware of the Defense Health Agency’s ongoing
efforts to improve access to healthcare for the millions of bene-
ficiaries enrolled in the military healthcare system. In addition to
broadening accessibility under the managed care network, recruit-
ing and retaining military medical providers, and achieving full
operational use of military medical facilities, exploring remote and
telehealth capabilities will be critical in sustaining the military
healthcare system as a high-quality benefit for servicemembers, re-
tirees, and military families.
Therefore, not later than March 1, 2026, the Secretary of Defense
shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives a briefing on the feasibility and
advisability of implementing telehealth-enabled therapeutic solu-
tions for the treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal (MSK)
injuries for members of the Armed Forces. This report should in-
clude: (1) A review of existing telehealth-enabled MSK solutions,
including pilot programs, and an assessment of the costs and bene-
fits of such solutions relative to in-person MSK treatments, includ-

member access to telehealth-enabled MSK solutions as a means to
enhance readiness and address barriers to compliance with in-per-
son physical therapy protocols; and (3) Any other relevant matters
that the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate.
Comptroller General review of blast overpressure docu-
mentation implementation
The committee remains concerned about the impact of blast over-
pressure exposure on servicemembers and their brain health. To
ensure that the Department of Defense is conducting timely imple-
mentation of congressional reforms in the Servicemember Quality
of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159), the committee directs the
Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a review of
the following:
(1) The status of implementation of blast overpressure re-
forms included in Public Law 118–159, including Sections 721
through 725, and any related report language in Senate Report
118–188;
(2) The status of each of the services in implementing base-
line cognitive assessments, as mandated under the August
2024 memorandum on ‘‘Department of Defense Requirements
for Managing Brain Health Risks from Blast Overpressure,’’
and regular follow-up assessments for servicemembers to track
brain health over their career;
(3) The progress of the Department and services in estab-
lishing and maintaining blast overpressure exposure logs and
traumatic brain injury logs and other documentation on expo-
sure for servicemembers; and
(4) Any steps the Department is taking to address the poten-
tial link between blast overpressure exposure and risks of sui-
cide.
The committee directs the Comptroller General to provide a
briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee on preliminary
findings, not later than April 1, 2026, with the results to follow in
a report and in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General study on impact of behavioral and
mental health staffing shortfalls at military medical
treatment facilities
The committee recognizes the importance of robust mental and
behavioral health care for military personnel and their families.
The committee is aware of a shortfall of behavioral and mental
health staffing in military medical treatment facilities, resulting in
the lack of timely mental health care for authorized beneficiaries.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller General of
the United States to conduct a study on: (1) Behavioral and mental
health staffing shortfalls at military medical treatment facilities
within the contiguous United States; (2) The impact of such short-
falls on access to care for Active-Duty members of the Armed
Forces; and (3) The effectiveness of steps to mitigate those impacts
and improve access to behavioral and mental health care for such
members.

The study should include an assessment of the following: (1) The
number of positions filled and the number of positions vacant at
military medical treatment facilities, including positions for behav-
ioral health and mental health providers in specialty clinics, behav-
ioral health consultants in primary care clinics, and other positions
that affect appointment availability for behavioral health services;
(2) The availability and timeliness of behavioral health and mental
health appointments for Active-Duty members of the Armed Forces
at military medical treatment facilities and through civilian pro-
vider networks under the TRICARE program (as defined in section
1072 of title 10, United States Code); and (3) An assessment of the
steps to be taken by the Department of Defense to help military
medical treatment facilities alleviate demand on behavioral health
and mental health providers and increase appointment availability
for behavioral health services, including by implementing new
triaging approaches, increased use of telehealth and behavioral
health technicians, hiring and retention support, or other strate-
gies.
The committee directs the Comptroller General to brief the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on this study, not later than January 12, 2026, with
a report to follow by a date mutually agreed upon at the time of
the briefing.
Continuing medical education for military professionals
The committee recognizes the important role of attendance at
professional conferences for military health professionals. Attend-
ance and participation in local, national, and international con-
ferences benefits military medical professionals and improves our
military’s readiness.
The committee understands that conference attendance is a vital
way to transfer and acquire knowledge and lessons learned to im-
prove patient care and reduce casualties, foster collaboration and
innovation, and obtain Continuing Medical Education (CME) cred-
its. Professional conferences improve readiness by connecting junior
military medical professionals with experienced combat veterans
who have deployed multiple times to combat regions, many of
whom are no longer in the military but remain active at national
conferences. They also provide settings to strengthen military-civil-
ian partnerships. Furthermore, attendance is a retention tool as it
improves morale, allows for professional development, and provides
opportunities for academic recognition that improves military phy-
sicians’ promotions into leadership positions.
Despite these benefits, military attendance at professional con-
ferences has declined over the last decade, at least in part due to
bureaucratic obstacles, lack of support from leadership, inadequate
funding, and a general undervaluing of the role national academic
medical conferences can play in maintaining our national strategic
advantage. The committee encourages the Department of Defense
to allocate resources toward and facilitate increased attendance of
military health professionals at professional conferences.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the Director of the
Defense Health Agency, Service Secretaries, and the Defense

cate resources toward and facilitate military health professionals’
increased attendance at professional conferences, as well as rec-
ommendations to overcome barriers to doing so.
Department of Defense pharmaceutical supply chain report
The committee is concerned by the challenges to ensuring
servicemembers have access to safe, high-quality, and effective
pharmaceutical drugs. The committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense to provide a briefing and report to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than July 1, 2026, on the Department of Defense’s (DOD) pur-
chasing of drugs and medical countermeasures, including the vol-
umes purchased and costs of these purchases, whether it has expe-
rienced any difficulties with supply challenges, including but not
limited to shortages related to each of these drugs, and any short-
falls. The report shall include the following information:
(1) DOD’s annual procurement of each of these drugs and
medical countermeasures, over the past 5 years, including the
number of purchased units, the cost, and the procurement
method used;
(2) The percentage of the U.S. commercial marketplace that
the DOD represents for each of these drugs and medical coun-
termeasures and explanations for any cases in which the DOD

ety of Health System Pharmacist Drug Shortage database;
(5) Notation of limitations in reporting to the FDA and the
range of drugs used by the DOD which may not be commonly
used by the public, including but not limited to medical coun-
termeasures, including whether each of these drugs experi-
enced any other supply challenges. These include but are not
limited to: products that are not available, products that are
not available at desired quantities, or products with significant
delays in procurement;
(6) The impact of these shortages on the DOD for each of
these drugs and medical countermeasures, including any im-
pact on military readiness, costs resulting from direct addi-
tional healthcare expenditure, indirect costs resulting from

countermeasures purchased by the DOD.
Foreign adversary threats to genetic medicine supply
chains
The committee remains concerned over potential threats to the
supply chains for genetic medicine, particularly for
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based tech-
nologies. It is imperative to protect advanced technologies from
supply chain disruption. Therefore, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than April 1,
2026, on: (1) Vulnerabilities related to bulk transfer of genetic in-
formation to foreign adversaries with potential application for fur-
ther development of adversarial DNA and RNA technologies; (2)
Recommendations for how foreign adversary access to bulk genetic
information and technology can be restricted; (3) Recommendations
for further restricting foreign adversary participation in U.S. sup-
ply chains for DNA and RNA technologies; and (4) Any other items
the Secretary determines relevant.
General temporary military contingency payment adjust-
ment for children’s hospitals
The committee is aware that a recent 2023 Defense Health Agen-
cy (DHA) rule modifies general temporary military contingency
payment adjustment policy and affects the reimbursement process
for children’s hospitals. In light of these changes, the committee
seeks to clarify the scope of the children’s hospital reimbursement
policy and ensure transparency in its implementation. The com-
mittee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a report to the

Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives not later than March 1, 2026. The report shall in-
clude:
(1) A definition of the term ‘‘essential’’ as defined in DHA
rule 2023–06452 and criteria for making that determination;
(2) A list of the criteria that would warrant reimbursement
as the rule is written;
(3) The total number of reimbursement claims submitted
since the implementation of the policy;
(4) The total dollar amount reimbursed under the policy dur-
ing that period;
(5) A breakdown of which children’s hospitals have received
reimbursements and by geographic region, if available;
(6) Any identified challenges or inconsistencies in the appli-
cations of the reimbursement policy; and
(7) An assessment of any access to care issues resulting from
the revised contingency payment adjustment policy.
The committee expects this report to inform future oversight and
potential legislative action related to children’s hospital reimburse-
ment policy and personnel support.
Medical licensure portability for the National Guard
The committee recognizes the essential role that National Guard
(NG) healthcare providers (HCPs) play in contributing to our
Armed Forces’ medical corps and medical enterprise. They are
asked to maintain a high level of readiness to deploy at a moment’s
notice to provide expert medical care to and save the lives of Amer-
icans during natural disasters or to servicemembers during mili-
tary operations. This high level of readiness depends on the ability
of NG HCPs to maintain expert proficiency through regular hands-
on trainings and certifications, especially on the kind of trauma
care most relevant to injuries during emergency or conflict sce-
narios.
The committee is aware that to obtain such specialized training,
NG HCPs may be required to travel to a completely different State
for annual training or other stateside operational missions requir-
ing medical support. The committee supports NG HCPs having
ready and easy access to the best cross-state training opportunities.
In order to streamline access by NG HCPs to cross-state training,
the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health
Affairs, in consultation with the Chief of the National Guard Bu-
reau, to provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on licensure portability for National Guard med-
ical providers and whether existing law presents barriers to gener-
ating readiness.
Military efforts to mitigate risks of antimicrobial resistance
The committee notes that one of the risks for servicemembers
with traumatic injuries is developing wound infections, especially
in austere environments. Bacteria or fungi that are resistant to
multiple antibiotics are growing domestically and globally. This has
become an increasing challenge for military causalities in Europe,
Asia, and Africa.

Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs, in consultation with the Joint Staff Sur-
geon, to provide a briefing, not later than May 2, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives summarizing Department of Defense efforts to detect
and mitigate antimicrobial resistance in the military health sys-
tem. The briefing should include the following: (1) An assessment
of the risk to military forces associated with antimicrobial resist-
ance; (2) A summary of the actions taken by the Director of the De-
fense Health Agency and the Surgeons General of the military de-
partments to mitigate the risks identified; and (3) Any other mat-
ters the Secretary determines to be relevant.
Military Health System facilities
The committee is concerned that there are not enough civilian or
military healthcare centers to treat the high number of casualties
likely to result from large-scale combat operations. Furthermore,
Military Health System care facilities face large, under-funded in-
frastructure requirements to upgrade often aging buildings. Given
the rising costs of healthcare coverage, which divert funding from
operational medical requirements, and other pressures on the De-
partment of Defense’s budget, there is an opportunity to consider
other financing mechanisms for improving Military Health System
care facilities. One option that has been successfully employed for
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare facilities is the
Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements
Needed for Veterans Act (CHIP–IN Act), which established a pilot
program to empower local communities to assist in the planning
and construction of VA healthcare facilities by leveraging private
financing and support. The committee believes that such a mecha-
nism might hold similar promise for Department of Defense facili-
ties.
Accordingly, the committee directs that the Secretary of Defense
brief the congressional defense committees, not later than March 1,
2026, on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a similar
program whereby local communities can assist with the planning
and construction of Department of Defense healthcare facilities
through privately subsidizing projects and other means of support.
The briefing should specifically address whether the CHIP–IN Act
could serve as a model for the Department of Defense to establish
a similar initiative which will effectively address any potential
shortfalls in military medical services during large-scale combat op-
erations.
Military medical personnel timecards
The committee notes that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) re-
quires military medical personnel to submit timecards to document
how these personnel are allocating their duty and leave hours. The
data from these timecards is important to address military staffing
challenges in military treatment facilities (MTFs). The committee
is aware that there are many limitations, inconsistencies, and inac-
curacies associated with the current timecard system.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs to submit a semi-annual briefing on the

timecard data compiled by the Defense Health Agency, not later
than January 15, 2026, and continuing every 6 months thereafter
until December 31, 2028. These briefings should include the fol-
lowing: (1) The number of hours military medical personnel are
spending in each timecard category, broken out by type of provider
(e.g. exclusively assigned to an MTF, dual-assigned to a non-MTF
unit, or period-intermittently assigned to an MTF), military depart-
ment, and Defense Health Network; (2) An assessment of whether
military personnel are accurately completing timecard submissions
as required by the DHA; and (3) Any other matters as determined
by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.
National Disaster Medical System pilot program
The committee notes that section 740 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92), as
amended by Section 741 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law
116–283), directed a pilot program to establish civilian and military
partnerships to enhance interoperability and medical surge capa-
bility and capacity of the National Disaster Medical System. While
the committee continues to support implementation of this pilot
program, the Department of Defense has been inconsistent in pro-
viding the committee with timely updates on the execution of the
program.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the Defense
Health Agency (DHA), in consultation with the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for Health Affairs, to provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than March 1, 2026, on the im-
plementation of the pilot program both as a whole and at each of
the five pilot sites. Specifically, the briefing should discuss DHA
initiatives to test and scale effective site-specific projects; any ini-
tial analysis of the pilot program in terms of cost and effectiveness;
and any preliminary recommendations for legislative or adminis-
trative actions such as extending the pilot program or making its
authority permanent.
Nonaddictive opioid alternatives
The committee remains concerned about the continued use of
opioids by active-duty and retired servicemembers for the treat-
ment of pain. The committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs to provide a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
and publicly post on their website, not later than March 1, 2026,
on steps the Department will take to ensure that nonaddictive al-
ternatives to opioids are on the TRICARE Uniform Formulary. The
report shall include a timeline detailing when these medications
will be available to TRICARE beneficiaries once they have received
Food and Drug Administration approval.
On-demand intravenous fluids for expeditionary medicine
The committee recognizes that intravenous (IV) fluids have been
in limited supply domestically since 2014, even prior to the wide-
spread shortages caused by Hurricanes Maria and Helene. The
committee also recognizes the large quantities of resources required

by the Department of Defense to ship IV fluids around the world.
The committee supports the efforts undertaken by the Department
of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services to
develop a modular, self-contained, distributed, and sterile manufac-
turing platform for IV fluids. The committee recognizes that this
platform requires modifications to succeed in the contested logistics
domains, including rapid detection of endotoxin.
Therefore, the committee encourages budgeting for sterile IV
fluids for expeditionary medicine in fiscal year 2027 and beyond.
Additionally, the committee encourages the military services to en-
gage directly with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order
to expedite the review process related to on-demand fluids in for-
ward operating locations.
Private sector support for multi-patient movement contin-
gency requirements
The committee notes that rapid movement of wounded, ill, and
injured servicemembers is critically important in contingency oper-
ations. The committee is aware that the Joint Staff, U.S. Transpor-
tation Command (TRANSCOM), and the Global Patient Movement
Joint Advisory Board have analyzed the projected military airlift
capacity and medical operations required to support patient move-
ment from outside the continental United States to the continental
United States (CONUS) and then to distribute patients within
CONUS in accordance with the National Disaster Medical System
guidance and the Integrated Continental United States Medical
Operations Plan. The analysis demonstrated a shortfall of military
airlift and fully equipped medical crews to provide comprehensive
aeromedical services.
To address these gaps, the committee understands the Defense
Health Agency issued a request to augment the Department of De-
fense’s (DOD) aeromedical evacuation system with commercial
wide-body aircraft capable of interoperability with the military sys-
tem to achieve patient movement within CONUS. As a proof of con-
cept, TRANSCOM invited private sector partners to participate in
the Ultimate Caduceus 2024 exercise at Travis Air Force Base. The
private sector demonstrated an ability to provide an appropriately
configured aircraft with supplies and medical crews identical to
current DOD patient movement standards.
With appropriate planning, this exercise proved a civilian capa-
bility to provide large-volume patient movements to augment the
military aeromedical evacuation system during contingencies. The
committee applauds this outstanding example of a military-civilian
partnership critical to enhancing medical casualty evacuation
worldwide and encourages the DOD to continue exercising these
capabilities with regularity.
TRICARE contingency planning
The Defense Health Agency (DHA) administers the TRICARE
program to provide healthcare benefits to beneficiaries in Depart-
ment of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and
clinics, as well as through participating civilian healthcare provider
networks. In the event of significant numbers of combat casualties
that exhaust the current Departments of Defense and Veterans Af-

fairs’ capacity, the National Disaster Medical System exists to sup-
plement military healthcare systems and response capabilities.
However, the committee believes that further analysis is required
to understand the ability of DHA to efficiently coordinate care
among civilian providers in the event of large-scale combat oper-
ations.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director, DHA, in consulta-
tion with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 1, 2026, on the feasibility and advisability of
modifying TRICARE’s Managed Care Support Contract to better
prepare for the high casualties likely to result from large-scale
combat operations. The briefing should specifically consider the fea-
sibility and advisability of adding an emergency clause to private
medical providers’ contracts with TRICARE that would account for
all medical needs of the Department of Defense in the contiguous
United States.
TRICARE pharmacy briefing
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a con-
fidential briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee once
each 180 days, beginning February 1, 2026, and ending on Feb-
ruary 1, 2029, on the difference in reimbursement rates or prac-
tices, direct and indirect remuneration fees or other price conces-
sions, and clawbacks between: (1) Pharmacies that are affiliates of
TRICARE’s contracted pharmacy benefit manager; and (2) Phar-
macies that are not affiliates of TRICARE’s contracted pharmacy
benefit manager.
The briefing shall also include the amount of any administrative
fee received by the contracted pharmacy benefit manager for each
prescription such contractor processes under TRICARE’s pharmacy
program.
TRICARE provider and beneficiary complaint mechanism
The committee continues to hear from TRICARE providers and
beneficiaries about issues that cannot be resolved directly through
regional managed care support contractors. The committee is fur-
ther aware that when providers and beneficiaries are faced with
these situations, they do not have effective mechanisms through
which they can file complaints directly to the Defense Health Agen-
cy (DHA).
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the Defense
Health Agency to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 1, 2026, describing: (1) How DHA oversees complaint
resolution processes operated by the TRICARE-managed care sup-
port contractors; (2) How DHA assesses the performance of those
complaint resolution processes; (3) How DHA assists beneficiaries
and providers who have been told that a managed care support
contractor cannot resolve the issue; (4) How DHA makes bene-
ficiaries and providers aware of that process; and (5) How DHA is
seeking to address concerns from beneficiaries and providers that
they cannot resolve issues through the existing complaint resolu-
tion processes.

U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay
The committee is aware that the Defense Health Agency is con-
sidering realigning healthcare resources in military treatment fa-
cilities, including U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
where over 4,000 personnel are permanently assigned and have no
access to care within the immediate area of the base. The com-
mittee notes that Section 715 of the James M. Inhofe National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263)
prevents the Secretary of Defense from modifying the scope of med-
ical care before certifying to Congress the extent to which the com-
mander at each military installation has been consulted regarding
the proposed modification. The committee notes that despite delib-
erations regarding the downsizing of the U.S. Naval Hospital in
Guantanamo Bay, the committee has not received the required no-
tification under law.
Due to the lack of alternative providers adjacent to U.S. Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay; potential inpatient responsibilities as-
signed in certain U.S. Southern Command plans; and the require-
ment to treat TRICARE beneficiaries, local employees, law of war
detainees, and future contingency operation personnel, the com-
mittee urges the Department of Defense to maintain adequate
medical services and justify to Congress as required under statute
any proposed reduction of medical care at U.S. Naval Hospital in
Guantanamo Bay.
Unified joint military trauma system
The committee is aware of the challenges the future battlespace
will place on combat medical operations and the need for modern-
ized casualty care. The committee recently received testimony on
the readiness of the Military Health System, which noted that the
Department of Defense lacks ‘‘a coherent, unified strategy for mili-
tary medical readiness that will deliver expert trauma/burn care on
future battlefields while also benefitting civilian trauma care and
public health.’’ Additionally, the testimony suggests the Uniformed
Services University is currently developing a comprehensive mili-
tary trauma system policy roadmap that considers the direct care
component, civilian partnerships, the role of the National Guard
and Reserve, synergy with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and
involvement with the National Disaster Medical System and Na-
tional Trauma Emergency Preparedness System.
The committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Health Affairs to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the sta-
tus of the military trauma system policy roadmap not later than
March 1, 2026. The briefing shall include the following elements:
(1) A list of the organizations involved in the development of
the military trauma system policy roadmap effort;
(2) An explanation of the objectives, status, and anticipated
completion date of the updated policy;
(3) An assessment of any barriers inhibiting the Department
from implementing the updated military trauma system policy;
and
(4) Any other matters the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Health Affairs considers relevant.

Wound care and management in future combat
The committee commends the Department of Defense for its con-
tinued activities focused on treating injuries sustained by
servicemembers in austere environments. The committee is aware
of the challenges the future battlespace will place on medical sup-
port operations and the need for modernized casualty care capabili-
ties for combat operations, including wound care and management.
The committee is concerned with the lack of a comprehensive
Military Health System strategy to address wound care and man-
agement, encompassing advances in research, development, clinical
care, and education and training to deliver lifesaving pre-hospital
wound care, stabilize battlefield casualties, and enhance readiness
with robust return to duty rates.
Therefore, the committee encourages the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Health Affairs to convene a working group of subject
matter experts to develop a strategy for wound care and manage-
ment, including prevention, treatment, and advanced wound care
to address wound infection in future operational environments.
The committee also directs that, not later than March 1, 2026,
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs submit a
briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives that includes: (1) Identification of and
recommendations to amend clinical practice guidelines to treat
combat wounds in future battlespaces; (2) Identification of and rec-
ommendations for education and training needs and military-civil-
ian partnerships applicable to the advancement of wound care and
management following combat injury; and (3) A summary of any
engagement with industry and academic medical institutions to
support partnerships to address the wound care and management
needs of servicemembers in future operational environments.

TITLE VIII—ACQUISITION POLICY, ACQUISI-
TION MANAGEMENT, AND RELATED MAT-
TERS
Subtitle A—Acquisition Policy and Management
Sec. 801—Transition of program executive officer role to
portfolio acquisition executive
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1737(a) of title 10, United States Code, to redefine program ex-
ecutive officers as portfolio acquisition executives and provide such
portfolio acquisition executives with greater authorities and respon-
sibilities for requirements, resourcing, and acquisition.
Sec. 802—Capstone requirements
The committee recommends a provision that would create a new

Section 9:
section, 3209, to title 10, United States Code, to establish capstone
requirements for three or more portfolio acquisition executives in
consultation with the Joint Requirements Oversight Council to en-
able greater speed, agility, and innovation in fielding military capa-
bilities.
Sec. 803—Modification to acquisition strategy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4211 of title 10, United States Code, by modifying specific re-
quirements for acquisition strategies.
Sec. 804—Modifications to modular open systems approach
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 4401–4403 of title 10, United States Code, by clarifying defi-
nitions of the modular open systems approach and mandating im-
plementation plans, enforceable contract clauses, and centralized
digital repositories for modular system interfaces. The committee
notes that the provision seeks to reduce supplier dependency and
vendor lock by requiring non-proprietary, machine-readable inter-
faces to facilitate third-party integration and system upgrades.
Sec. 805—Alternative test and evaluation pathway for des-
ignated defense acquisition programs
The committee recommends a provision that would establish an
alternative pathway for the test and evaluation (T&E) of software
acquisition programs using authorities in section 3603 of title 10,
United States Code, and other programs designated by the Sec-
retary of Defense.
The committee notes that the alternative test and evaluation
pathway would require programs to develop unified T&E strategies
integrating developmental and operational testing, exempt covered

programs from traditional requirements like T&E Master Plans
and milestone-specific tests, and require robust data strategies
with government-owned test data. Finally, the committee notes
that, under this provision, the Director of Operational Test and
Evaluation retains independent oversight, focusing on data suffi-
ciency and continuous analysis without mandating specific test
plans. Under this provision, the Secretary of Defense must issue
implementation guidance, not later than 180 days after the date of
the enactment of this Act. The Secretary must also submit a report
to the congressional defense committees on the pathway’s effective-
ness, not later than 3 years after the enactment of this Act.
Sec. 806—Department of Defense member of Cost Account-
ing Standards Board
The committee recommends a provision that, pursuant to section
1501 of title 41, United States Code, would designate the Director
of Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy as the De-
partment of Defense member of the Cost Accounting Standards
Board.
Sec. 807—Combatant command experimentation authority
The committee recommends a provision that would provide the
combatant commands the authority to conduct experimentation,
prototyping, and technology demonstrations to support the develop-
ment and testing of innovative technologies and capability solu-
tions to address operational needs identified by the combatant com-
mand.
Subtitle B—Amendments to General Contracting
Authorities, Procedures, and Limitations
Sec. 821—Modifications to nontraditional defense contractor
definitions
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3014 of title 10, United States Code, to add to the definition
of a nontraditional defense contractor those business entities that
do not qualify as a covered segment as defined under the Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 231.205–18 or suc-
cessor regulation.
Sec. 822—Financing for covered activities
The committee recommends a provision that would allow financ-
ing costs to be allowable and allocable as a cost for federal con-
tracts and subcontracts with certain stipulations.
The committee recognizes the increasing availability of private-
sector financing opportunities to support, complement, and rein-
force defense and national security needs. The committee is encour-
aged that the Department of Defense and defense companies are
exploring ways to boost production of critical defense articles with
private sources of capital, which can support investments in supply
chains and capital improvements. Such investments are vital to fill
gaps where defense investment is unavailable or cannot be lever-
aged quickly enough to take advantage of fast-paced business cy-

cles. They can also help smooth over the uncertain cycles of govern-
ment appropriations.
The committee is increasingly aware that the distinctions be-
tween these types of private sector financing, including private cap-
ital, private equity, and venture capital, is important for the De-
partment to understand in order to make sure that is it using the
right tool for the right job. However, the committee notes that more
training, education, and encouragement is needed for a wider range
of acquisition officials in the Department to become familiar and
comfortable with using these tools. The committee encourages the
Secretary of Defense to do more to update Department regulations
and training in order to facilitate these arrangements.
Sec. 823—Exemptions for nontraditional defense contractors
The committee recommends a provision that would exempt non-
traditional defense contractors as defined by section 3014 of title
10, United States Code, from certain business requirements.
Sec. 824—Modifications to treatment of certain products
and services as commercial products and commercial
services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3457 of title 10, United States Code, to require contracting of-
ficers to treat nontraditional defense contractors at any tier of the
contract as commercial products and commercial services unless a
written determination is approved by the head of the contracting
activity, delegable no lower than the senior contracting official. The
committee notes that the provision would not make products and
services that are treated as commercial as a result of the contrac-
tor’s nontraditional defense contractor status eligible for the com-
mercial item preference as specified in section 3453 of title 10,
United States Code, unless a commercial item determination is also
made for the product or service.
Sec. 825—Modifications to commercial products and com-
mercial services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 3453 and 3456 of title 10, United States Code, to establish a
formal process for determining the non-availability of commercial
products or commercial services and require the contracting officer
and program manager of the Department of Defense (DOD) to sub-
mit written memoranda before using non-commercial solicitation
procedures, explaining the decision based on market research and
requirements analyses. The provision would also add consultants,
researchers, and advisors as acquisition officials to ensure their
compliance with rules prioritizing the preference for commercial
products and commercial services when supporting DOD market
research and requirements drafting.
Sec. 826—Modifications to commercial solutions openings
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3458 of title 10, United States Code, by expanding the pur-
poses for which the commercial solutions openings solicitation pro-
cedure may be used and creating an authority for sole-source fol-

low-on procurements provided the procedures of sections 4022 or
3204 of title 10, United States Code, are followed.
Sec. 827—Modifications to other transactions
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4022 of title 10, United States Code, to allow for follow-on pro-
duction authorities of other transaction agreements without a com-
petitive prototype if the capability has been demonstrated in a rel-
evant environment and the acquisition executive makes a written
determination.
Sec. 828—Modifications to procurement for experimental
purposes
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4023 of title 10, United States Code, by expanding the pur-
poses for which procurement is allowed for experimentation pur-
poses.
The committee notes that the Department of Defense has, in cer-
tain instances, applied procedures and requirements established
under sections 4021–4022 of title 10, United States Code, to trans-
actions executed under the authority of section 4023 of title 10,
United States Code, including requirements for competition and
certain cost-sharing arrangements. The committee clarifies that

Section 10:
section 4023 constitutes a distinct and separate authority from sec-
tions 4021–4022. Accordingly, purchases using mechanisms not
governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation made pursuant to

Section 11:
section 4023 are not subject to the procedures, requirements, or re-
strictions set forth in sections 4021–4022. This clarification ensures
that the Department of Defense may fully leverage the flexibility
provided by section 4023 to expedite and streamline acquisitions to
support experimentation as intended by the statute.
Sec. 829—Consumption-based solutions
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 253 of title 10, United States Code, by adding a new section
designated as section 3605. This section would make permanent
the procedures for consumption-based solutions that can be me-
tered and billed based on actual usage and have predetermined
pricing based on fixed price units.
Sec. 830—Modifications to prohibition on contracting with
persons that have fossil fuel operations with the Gov-
ernment of the Russian Federation or the Russian en-
ergy sector
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 804 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) by clarifying an exemption to the defini-
tion of business operations to include activities related to fulfilling
contracts with a fossil fuel company that has fossil fuel business
operations in the Russian Federation that were entered into prior
to the date of the enactment of the prohibition established in such

Section 12:
section.

Sec. 831—Modifications to relationship of other provisions
of law to procurement of commercial products and com-
mercial services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3452 of title 10, United States Code, to require identification
of defense-unique contract clause requirements for the procurement
of commercial products and commercial services that are based on
statute, Executive Orders, or acquisition policies.
Sec. 832—Limitation on required flowdown of contract
clauses to subcontractors providing commercial prod-
ucts or commercial services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 247 of title 10, United States Code, by creating a new section,
3459, that would limit the required flowdown of contract clauses
for subcontracts and supply agreements providing commercial prod-
ucts or commercial services.
Sec. 833—References in contracts to Department of Defense
policy documents, instructions, and manuals
The committee recommends a provision that would clarify that
references to Department of Defense policy documents, instruc-
tions, and manuals in contracts shall contain a specific version or
date.
Sec. 834—Uninsurable risk on certain contracts
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Department of Defense to consider equitable adjustments for the
loss of work in process on certain uninsurable contracts.
Sec. 835—Reporting of price increases
The committee recommends a provision that would establish sec-
tion 3709 of title 10, United States Code, to require contractors on
cost-reimbursable sole source contracts to inform the contracting of-
ficer of the Department of Defense of product and services that are
25 percent above the price specified in the contract bid, 25 percent
above the price the Government paid in the previous year, or 50
percent above the price paid 5 years earlier.
Sec. 836—Instructions for continued operational readiness
The committee recommends a provision that would establish sec-
tion 4664 of title 10, United States Code, to require contractors for
covered equipment to provide maintenance, repair, and operational
information to ensure operational readiness.
Sec. 837—Indemnification of contractors against nuclear
and unusually hazardous risks
The committee recommends a provision that would define the
process by which the Department of Defense reviews requests by
contractors for indemnification against nuclear and unusually haz-
ardous risks. The provision would stipulate that final decisions on
approval or denial of such requests be completed within 90 days.

Sec. 838—Late submission of cost and pricing data as in-
valid defense to contract price reductions for defective
cost or pricing data
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3706(c) of title 10, United States Code, to limit a prime con-
tractor or subcontractor from submitting after the date of agree-
ment on the price of a contract any cost or pricing data obtained
or otherwise made available more than 30 days before the date of
agreement on the price of a contract.
Sec. 839—Modifications to submissions of cost or pricing
data
The committee recommends a provision that would increase the
threshold requiring the submission of certified cost or pricing data
under section 3702 of title 10, United States Code, from $2.0 mil-
lion to $10.0 million for prime contracts entered into after June 30,

Section 13:
2026.
The committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acqui-
sition and Sustainment to conduct a study on the impacts of ex-
emptions from, or raising the threshold from $2.0 million to $10.0
million for, requirements for contractors and subcontractors to sub-
mit certified cost or pricing data under section 3702 of title 10,
United States Code, on the willingness of companies to participate
in the defense industrial base. The report shall be submitted to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than December 1, 2026, and annually
thereafter until December 1, 2028. The report shall include the fol-
lowing:
(1) An assessment of the change in the number of unique
contractors and subcontractors required to submit certified cost
or pricing data prior to any changes in statutory requirements
and after such changes, if applicable;
(2) An assessment of the total dollars covered by certified
cost or pricing data prior to any changes in statutory require-
ments and after such changes, if applicable;
(3) An assessment of the growth in the number of partici-
pants in the defense industrial base following any modifica-
tions to the certified cost or pricing data requirements, if appli-
cable; and
(4) Qualitative and quantitative evidence demonstrating
whether changes to the certified cost or pricing data statute
and related requirements are contributing to a change in par-
ticipation in the defense industrial base, including any identi-
fied trends, barriers, or incentives affecting contractor partici-
pation.

tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law

Sec. 842—Small unmanned aircraft system industrial base
remediation plan
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, act-
ing through the Director of the Joint Production Accelerator Cell
and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy,
to develop a roadmap for the desired state of the small, unmanned
aircraft system (sUAS) industrial base to support existing sUAS
programs, not later than March 1, 2026. The provision also would
require that the Secretary of Defense submit the roadmap to the
congressional defense committees. The provision would also require
the Secretary of Defense to seek to enter into a contract with a fed-
erally funded research and development center to conduct a review
of the defense industrial base of the United States for sUAS compo-
nents and finished articles and to provide a report to the Secretary,
not later than September 30, 2026, with the Secretary providing
the report, along with comments, to the congressional defense com-
mittees, not later than 30 days thereafter.
The committee remains concerned about insufficient capacity and
capability within the defense industrial base for sUAS and the lack
of clear guidance and demand from the Department of Defense
(DOD) to industry to create a resilient, competitive, and effective
sUAS industrial base. The committee notes that the Congress has
enacted several provisions to limit Federal procurement of sUAS
and associated components produced in the People’s Republic of
China and to incentivize domestic production of sUAS. The com-
mittee believes that the ability to produce sUAS at scale to meet
the demands of the DOD depends on having access to a robust sup-
ply of critical components from domestic and allied sources, includ-
ing onshoring production and incentivizing private and Govern-
ment-owned manufacturing facilities to produce sUAS components
to support the development of this supply chain.
Sec. 843—Application of national security waiver for stra-
tegic materials sourcing requirement to sensitive mate-
rials
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4872 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary
of Defense or his authorized delegate to apply a national security
waiver determined under section 4863(k) of title 10, United States
Code, to section 4872 of title 10, United States Code, for the same
covered material and end item.
Sec. 844—Prohibition on acquisition of clothing and fabric
from countries of concern under domestic-sourcing
waivers
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4862 of title 10, United States Code, to prohibit the Depart-
ment of Defense from purchasing clothing or textiles from countries
of concern when an availability exception is granted due to the
nonavailability of domestically-sourced options.

Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Secu-
rity until the Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional de-
fense committees that the requirements under section 847 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public
Law 116–92) have been implemented and submits a plan and
timeline for continued implementation of such requirements.
Sec. 846—Prohibition of procurement of molybdenum,
gallium, or germanium from non-allied foreign nations
and authorization for production from recovered mate-
rial
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4872 of title 10, United States Code, to add molybdenum,
gallium, and germanium to the definition of covered material, as
well as authorizes an exception to the prohibition for certain recov-
ered material.
Sec. 847—Sourcing options for certain critical products
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, as soon as practicable, but not later than fis-
cal year 2031, to ensure the Department of Defense maintains mul-
tiple sources for certain critical products.
Sec. 848—Prohibiting the purchase of photovoltaic modules
or inverters from Foreign Entities of Concern
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated by
this Act or otherwise made available to be used to enter into a con-
tract for the procurement of photovoltaic modules manufactured by
a foreign entity of concern.
Sec. 849—Modernization of Army arsenals
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of the Army to accelerate the modernization of the
Army’s organic industrial base to meet munitions requirements.

Subtitle E—Other Matters
Sec. 861—Clarification of procurement prohibition related
to acquisition of materials mined, refined, and sepa-
rated in certain countries
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 844(a) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) to
clarify that the authority is intended to apply to a contract for any
covered material mined, refined, or separated in any covered nation
entered into on January 1, 2027, and after, not to apply to end
items delivered by January 1, 2027, as previously noted by a De-
fense Federal Acquisition Regulation.
The committee understands that the Department of Defense will
have certain domestic or allied suppliers in place by the effective
date of the requirement to allow industry to meet the requirements
associated with section 844 by the required date.
Sec. 862—Independent study on the acquisition workforce of
the Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to contract with a qualified organization to
conduct an independent study of the defense acquisition workforce,
assessing its: (1) Effectiveness; (2) Recruitment; (3) Retention; (4)
Training; (5) Size; (6) Workload; and (7) Integration with related
fields like requirements and budgeting. The study seeks to assess
the use of metrics, career incentives, and modern tools to achieve
positive acquisition outcomes. The provision would require the Sec-
retary of Defense to submit the unaltered report from the qualified
organization, along with an assessment of the findings and rec-
ommendations, to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than December 31,

The committee recommends a provision that would authorize an
expedited acceptance waiver if a contractor, through the use of sup-
ply chain illumination procedures, discovers an item in the supply
chain that is non-compliant and implements a corrective plan to
ensure future compliance with existing requirements. The provision
would also require the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition

tion, the provision would also require, not later than 90 days after
the report’s submission, the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan
to implement critical munitions requirements to fight simultaneous
conflicts in the next budget cycle.
The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense can
no longer assume that our adversaries are divided, that the United
States will be able to fight one war at a time, and that the United
States can fight one war while deterring aggression elsewhere. The
committee believes that the Department of Defense must be pre-
pared for simultaneous conflicts in multiple theaters. The com-
mittee also believes that, to prevent simultaneous conflicts, the
United States needs the forces necessary to demonstrate to our ad-
versaries the ability to fight and win in a conflict should deterrence
fail.
Sec. 865—Permanent extension and modification of dem-
onstration and prototyping program to advance inter-
national product support capabilities in a contested lo-
gistics environment
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 842 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to remove the 3-year sunset and to add
digital manufacturing as part of the prototyping program for con-
tested logistics.
Sec. 866—Estimate of ally and partner demand for United
States-produced munitions and specified expendables
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish an annual requirement for an es-
timate of the demand by U.S. allies and partners for U.S.-produced
munitions and specified expendables across the future-years de-
fense plan. Each estimate shall: (1) Be disaggregated by specific
munitions type and ally or partner; and (2) Include the following:
(a) analytical inputs such as information from foreign military
sales cases; (b) foreign partner munitions needs for operational or
contingency planning scenarios; (c) wargaming results that include
foreign partner contributions; and (d) estimates based on discus-
sions with foreign governments.
The committee notes that the war in Ukraine, Houthi attacks in
the Red Sea, and other instances have demonstrated the potential
for rapid depletion of munitions during conflict, which would be ex-
acerbated even further during a protracted conflict. The committee
remains concerned by the ability of the U.S. defense industrial base
to replenish munitions stockpiles and to surge production. The
committee believes that collaboration with allies and partners of-
fers economies of scale to maintain consistent production demand
and increase interoperability.

Sec. 867—Reform of contractor performance information re-
quirements
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Reg-
ulation Supplement (Part 242.15) to reform contractor performance
information requirements by establishing an objective, fact-based
system focused solely on verifiable negative performance events,
such as defective products, delinquent deliveries, or cybersecurity
breaches, in order to reduce subjectivity and administrative burden
while enabling identification of contractors with poor performance
histories. The revised system would eliminate subjective ratings in
the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System
(CPARS), implement a standardized scoring mechanism based on
transaction volume and contract value, and ensure transparency
for contractors. The provision also requires the Secretary of De-
fense to update regulations and CPARS guidance within 180 days
of the date of the enactment of this Act, with system modifications
completed within 1 year, and to submit a report on implementation
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, not later than 1 year after the date of the en-
actment of this Act. Additionally, the Comptroller General of the
United States shall review the new system’s effectiveness not later
than 3 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.
Sec. 868—Repeals of existing law to streamline the defense
acquisition process
The committee recommends a provision that would amend 86

Section 15:
sections of title 10, United States Code, and prior National Defense
Authorization Acts to repeal various statutory requirements related
to acquisition policies and processes and to reduce administrative
complexity related to reporting mandates, expired pilot programs,
outdated requirements, limitations, and other matters.
Sec. 869—Enhancement of defense supply chain resilience
and secondary source qualification
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 865 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public
Law 118–159) by expanding the scope of covered capabilities to in-
clude: (1) Critical readiness parts and systems; (2) Parts with sole-
source dependencies; (3) Excessive lead times; (4) Unreasonable
pricing; or (5) Other supply chain issues. The provision would es-
tablish Expedited Qualification Panels in each military department
to standardize and accelerate Source Approval Requests and Parts
Manufacturer Approvals within 14 days, utilizing conditional or
full approvals based on risk criteria. The provision would also pre-
vent duplicative review processes for aircraft parts already ap-
proved by civil aviation authorities, requiring written justification
for additional reviews. Finally, the provision would define critical
readiness parts and systems, safety critical items or mission-crit-
ical items, and non-safety critical items or non-mission-critical
items.

Sec. 870—Enhanced product support management for inte-
grated sustainment of weapon systems
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4324 of title 10, United States Code, to enhance weapon sys-
tem sustainment by integrating directive authority and responsi-
bility in product support managers to coordinate activities across
product support providers. The provision would establish a Major
Program Manager in each applicable Portfolio Acquisition Execu-
tive to manage the sustainment of in-service systems, create a for-
mal career path for product support managers with expertise in
sustainment or logistics, and institute a liaison officer program to
align with the sustainment working capital funds. Additionally, the
provision would define ‘‘critical readiness parts and systems’’ to ad-
dress readiness issues such as Mission Impaired Capability Await-
ing Parts and Not Mission Capable Supply.
Sec. 871—Modifications to current defense acquisition re-
quirements
The committee recommends a provision that would amend a
number of defense acquisition requirements. The provision would
amend: (1) Section 1749 of title 10, United States Code, to remove
the requirement that certain funding be provided on a reimburs-
able basis; (2) Section 2222 of title 10, United States Code, to ex-
pand the definition of covered defense business systems; (3) Section
3012 of title 10, United States Code, to replace ‘‘lowest overall cost
alternative’’ with ‘‘best value’’ in acquisition criteria; (4) Section
3069 of title 10, United States Code, to simplify buy-to-budget au-
thority by removing conditions; (5) Section 3204 of title 10, United
States Code, to revise sole-source contract approval thresholds and
authorities; (6) Section 3226 of title 10, United States Code, to in-
crease the uses of the availability of excess funds; (7) Section 3243
of title 10, United States Code, to simplify contractor incentives by
removing limitations; (8) Section 3374 of title 10, United States
Code, to add pre-award cost risk as an allowable profit factor; (9)

Section 16:
Section 3703 of title 10, United States Code, to amend the defini-
tion of adequate price competition; (10) Section 3705 of title 10,
United States Code, to amend recourses for data denials of cost or
pricing data; (11) Section 4201 of title 10, United States Code, to
amend the major defense acquisition program thresholds; (12) Sec-
tions 4882 and 4884 of title 10, United States Code, to transfer in-
dustrial base assistance and grant approvals to the Secretary of
Defense; (13) Section 4231 of title 10, United States Code, by re-
moving the requirement to determine low-rate initial production
quantities prior to Milestone B and inserting limitations on the
number of low-rate initial production lots and shipbuilding options
associated with fixed-price development contracts; (14) Section 890
of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232) to make permanent the pilot
program to accelerate contracting and pricing; and (15) Section
864(d) of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law

The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 222c of title 10, United States Code, to require the Secretary
of Defense, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment and the Chiefs of Staff of the Armed
Forces, to annually determine the minimum production level for
each variant of munitions required to meet the Out-Year Uncon-
strained Total Munitions Requirement. The provision would also
require the Secretary of Defense to incorporate the determined
minimum production levels into the planning, programming, budg-
eting, and execution process of the Department of Defense.
Sec. 873—Processes for incentivizing contractor expansion
of sources of supply
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to enhance military readiness by incentivizing
contractor expansion of supply sources for critical readiness parts
and systems. The provision would also mandate contractual re-
quirements for supplier diversification, including Acquisition Meth-
od Suffix Code reclassification to reduce sole-source dependency,
expedited qualification processes, and the use of simulation-based
verification for certification. The provision also would require the
Secretary to enforce data rights and deliverables or initiate reverse
engineering to qualify new suppliers if design activities fail to com-
ply within 30 days of notification. Finally, the provision would re-
quire the Secretary to submit a report to the congressional defense
committees, not later than December 31, 2027, on the implementa-
tion and impact of these measures.
Sec. 874—Duty-free entry of supplies procured by Depart-
ment of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to issue duty-free entry certificates in certain
circumstances, and requires supply chain tracking.
Sec. 875—Other transactions authority reporting
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Department of Defense to report expenditures carried out pursuant
to section 4021 of title 10, United States Code, for inclusion in the
searchable public website established by the Federal Funding Ac-
countability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–282).
Sec. 876—Assessment of competitive effects of defense con-
tractor transactions
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Comptroller General of the United States to conduct an assessment
of the competitive effects of defense contractor mergers and acquisi-
tions during the 10-year period ending on the date of the enact-
ment of this Act.

Sec. 877—Evaluation of TP-Link telecommunications equip-
ment for designation as covered telecommunications
equipment or services
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to evaluate telecommunications equipment
and services manufactured or provided by TP-Link Technologies
Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries to determine whether such equipment
should be designated as covered telecommunications equipment or
services under section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232). The
Secretary must brief the congressional defense committees on the
determination not later than December 1, 2026.
Sec. 878—Country-of-origin disclosure requirements for ge-
neric drugs purchased by the Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Department of Defense from procuring a generic drug for resale un-
less the seller discloses the country the generic drug was manufac-
tured in and the country of origin for all active pharmaceutical in-
gredients and key starting materials.
Sec. 879—Phase-out of computer and printer acquisitions in-
volving entities owned or controlled by China
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of Defense from directly or indirectly acquiring com-
puters or printers manufactured by covered Chinese entities, with
a phased implementation beginning at 10 percent of Department of
Defense total procurement in fiscal year 2026 and reaching 100
percent by fiscal year 2029. The provision allows waivers for items
used for testing, evaluation, and reverse engineering missions on
adversarial products and capabilities.
Sec. 880—Prohibition on operation, procurement, and con-
tracting related to foreign-made additive manufacturing
machines
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of Defense from operating or procuring covered additive
manufacturing machines manufactured in or using software and
data storage from China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia. The provi-
sion includes exceptions for intelligence, electronic warfare, and in-
formation warfare operations and allows the Secretary to waive the
prohibition on a case-by-case basis by certifying to the congres-
sional defense committees that it is required in the national inter-
est.
Items of Special Interest
Advanced polymeric composite ammunition materials
The committee understands the importance of developing sources
of production of advanced polymeric composite materials for large
caliber ammunition. These materials have the potential to provide
significant benefits to the warfighter, such as weight reduction and
improving operational mobility. Advanced polymeric materials have
shown promise mitigating challenges with chamber heat, which

may lead to longer lifespan for weaponry. With the existing supply
chain challenges faced by the Department of Defense (DOD) with
critical materials, alternative options should be reviewed.
There is an urgent and ongoing need for state-of-the-art ammuni-
tion components and nonferrous, non-metallic materials capable of
withstanding extreme operational environments. Current global
threats and near-peer competition have underscored vulnerabilities
in traditional metals-based supply chains and exposed the neces-
sity for innovative, high-performance alternatives.
The committee believes the DOD should emphasize domestic ma-
terial sourcing and manufacturing to ensure resilient, secure sup-
ply chain integrity to support the warfighter.
Biosurveillance for servicemember readiness
The committee commends the Department of Defense (DOD) for
its coordinated efforts within the biodefense and medical research
community to support servicemember health and readiness. There
are a variety of existing efforts the Department undertakes to sup-
port early detection and risk awareness to inform decision-making
against naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate biological
threats. The committee understands that the Global Emerging In-
fections Surveillance (GEIS) program was created to improve infec-
tious disease surveillance, prevention, and response capability to
better protect the health of the Joint Force. The GEIS program re-
ceives input from multiple data sources.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than April
1, 2026, on the overall biosurveillance strategy designed to sustain
a biosurveillance program capable of forecasting potential threats
to servicemember health and readiness. The briefing should in-
clude: (1) Efforts to integrate biosurveillance platforms and data
streams supported through military-civilian partnerships with the
DOD’s laboratories; (2) Resourcing challenges or delays associated
with the platforms; (3) Agile acquisition instruments utilized to
sustain or deploy biosurveillance platforms; (4) The role the GEIS
program, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and any
other service-connected labs or surveillance entities play in sending
or analyzing biosurveillance data; (5) How the Department antici-
pates utilizing biosurveillance data moving forward; and (6) Any
other items the Secretary determines relevant.
Briefing on feasibility and advisability of biomanufacturing
in Indo-Pacific
The committee understands the supply chain benefits associated
with advanced biomanufacturing capabilities. Working toward for-
ward-deployed biomanufacturing capabilities could enhance the
readiness and lethality of the warfighter.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than June 1, 2026, on the feasibility and
advisability of conducting a pilot program on advanced bio-manu-
facturing for supply chain resilience and improved lethality in the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The evaluation of a potential pilot pro-
gram should include, but not be limited to: (1) The feasibility of

local sourcing of critical biologic materials in the region; (2) An as-
sessment of existing technology or capabilities that could be for-
ward-deployed to enhance readiness and lethality; (3) An evalua-
tion of the cost-effectiveness of using raw materials as close to the
point-of-manufacturing as possible; (4) A determination on the fea-
sibility and advisability of conducting such a pilot program and
what the associated costs would be; and (5) Any other matters the
Secretary determines relevant.
Briefing on Neodymium Iron Boron Magnets
The committee believes that investments in rare earth magnet
manufacturing and manufacturing equipment show potential to
make domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing more competitive
in the global marketplace. This would reduce reliance on foreign
adversaries for rare earth magnets such as neodymium iron boron
magnets (NdFeB), which are necessary for Department of Defense
requirements. NdFeB magnets are necessary for submarines, air-
craft, and missile guidance systems, but also for non-defense crit-
ical infrastructure. As such, the committee encourages the Depart-
ment of Defense to facilitate public and private sector cooperation
to establish manufacturing facilities and manufacturing equipment
produced in the United States. The committee directs the Secretary
of Defense to provide a briefing to the committee, not later than
March 1, 2026, on an analysis of domestic NdFeB manufacturing
in the United States or allied nations and identify barriers, includ-
ing resource constraints, to domestic rare earth magnet production.
Briefing on textile war reserve stocks
The committee is aware that the Defense Logistics Agency com-
missioned a wargame exercise in late 2023 to identify critical areas
of concern within the domestic clothing and textiles defense indus-
trial base. This exercise, conducted by the Center for Naval Anal-
yses, confirmed the weakness of the current supply chain and high-
lighted deficiencies and production gaps that could occur during fu-
ture operations. The wargame report highlighted how stockpiling of
critical material components and end items could provide a
logistical advantage by adding strategic excess of critical safety
items such as uniforms, footwear, and personal protective equip-
ment.
The military departments are required to maintain strategic war
reserve stocks of ‘‘go-to-war’’ items, including clothing and textiles
such as uniforms, footwear, and personal protective equipment, to
support the initial surge in requirements during a contingency. The
committee is concerned that the military services may not have
sufficient items in their existing war reserve stocks.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than April 1, 2026, detailing their ‘‘go-to-war’’ textile items whose
demand may surge in the case of a contingency, including uni-
forms, footwear, and personal protective equipment. The briefing
should include the status of each service’s textile war reserves, in-
cluding a list of items and quantities. The briefing should also ad-
dress ongoing efforts to increase commonality and standardization

of uniform and personal protective equipment items across the
military services.
Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protective
equipment
The committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense is dependent on materials containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) to produce individual chemical, biological, radio-
logical, and nuclear (CBRN) protective equipment. The committee
notes that a growing number of private companies are exiting the
PFAS manufacturing business, given the adverse impact of PFAS
on the health and safety of servicemembers. The committee under-
stands that PFAS-free textile technologies can provide new per-
formance capabilities for individual CBRN protective equipment
and other key defense functions. The committee believes individual
CBRN protection is a key part of strategic deterrence against our
adversaries and is concerned that the Department will not be able
to provide the Joint Force with advanced individual CBRN protec-
tion equipment unless it accelerates efforts to acquire and field
PFAS-free textile technologies.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 30, 2026,
on the Department’s strategy and plans to acquire PFAS-free tex-
tile technologies for individual CBRN protective equipment as soon
as feasible. The briefing should include: (1) Current efforts to se-
cure the industrial base for PFAS-free textile technologies for indi-
vidual CBRN protective equipment; (2) A description of how ad-
vanced performance may enable new CBRN doctrines that enhance
survivability and lethality in contested environments; and (3) The
appropriations and authorities necessary to ensure these new tech-
nologies can be fielded by the start of fiscal year 2028.
Combatting viral pathogens and bioengineered viruses
The committee is aware of concerns regarding the rapid evolution
of viral pathogens and the potential for bioengineered viruses to be
weaponized by foreign adversaries, posing significant threats to na-
tional security and global stability. The committee is encouraged by
the ongoing work of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chem-
ical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense on the Genera-
tive Unconstrained Intelligent Drug Engineering program, which
began last year. The Department of Defense Chemical and Biologi-
cal Defense Program is adapting to the rapid evolution of viral
pathogens and the potential of bioengineered viruses, and it is
doing so by developing capabilities that could rapidly produce med-
ical countermeasures and other solutions to address and combat
the threat, regardless of the specific threat source, and by creating
additional medical countermeasures that are less risky altogether.
The committee believes that the way to combat these unknown
risks is to invest in capabilities that can prepare the Nation to
tackle any challenge rather than working toward a specific threat.

Commercial requirements evaluation
The committee is concerned that in some cases Department of
Defense (DOD) program managers apply non-commercial require-
ments against commercial products, negating the benefits of cost
and speed in using commercial products. Therefore, the committee
directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment to submit a report to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
February 1, 2026, on policies and procedures to prevent the unnec-
essary application of non-commercial requirements upon commer-
cial systems. Such a report shall also assess how the Department
can better leverage commercial test data to satisfy DOD develop-
mental, operational test, and safety release decisions.
Comptroller General assessment of information technology
contracts
The committee notes that the Secretary of Defense has issued
several memoranda related to cost efficiency and the elimination of
wasteful spending related to how certain information technology
(IT) programs are managed within the Department of Defense
(DOD). The memoranda, ‘‘Implementation of Executive Order
14222—Department of Government Efficiency Cost Efficiency Ini-
tiative,’’ dated May 27, 2025, and ‘‘Implementation of Department
of Government Efficiency Cost Efficiency Initiative,’’ dated June 23,
2025, directed the Department to take actions to, among other
things, terminate certain IT services contracts and move IT con-
sulting and management services from contract staff to government
employees. The latter memorandum articulates additional review
and approval requirements for such contracts.
The committee is concerned that such moves may have unfore-
seen consequences by misunderstanding or mischaracterizing some
relationships between commercial providers and integrators and
may not be informed by adequate cost analysis, which would help
understand the impacts on contract spending. In addition, the
move to eliminate some contract services and bring some functions
in-house seems divorced from a full understanding of the impact of
ongoing reductions in force, civilian workforce cuts, and hiring
freezes. The committee is concerned that such moves may exacer-
bate contracting timelines rather than make the process more effi-
cient or effective.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a review of the potential impact of these
memoranda, including: (1) Any additional implementation plans
and activities being undertaken by the DOD; (2) Input from indus-
try partners on their perception of the impacts of the memoranda;
(3) Assessment of any data on the cost impacts of such decisions;
(4) Assessment of the sufficiency of the civilian workforce to take
on identified insourcing initiatives; and (5) Any other items as the
Comptroller General deems appropriate. The committee further di-
rects the Comptroller General to brief the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 1, 2026, with a report to follow at a mutually agreed
upon date.

Comptroller General review of Office of the Director of
Operational Test and Evaluation
The committee acknowledges the Secretary of Defense’s initiative
to reorganize the Office of the Director of Operational Test and
Evaluation (DOT&E), as outlined in the March 27, 2025, memo-
randum titled ‘‘Reorganization of the Office of the Director of Oper-
ational Test and Evaluation.’’ The committee recognizes DOT&E’s
statutory responsibility under section 139 of title 10, United States
Code, to provide independent oversight of operational and live-fire
testing for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and other pro-
grams designated by the Director or the Secretary of Defense. This
role is essential to ensuring that weapons systems are evaluated
for suitability, survivability, and effectiveness in realistic oper-
ational environments.
The committee seeks additional information on the proposed re-
organization, which adjusts DOT&E’s workforce by more than 50
percent, to understand the balance between flexible acquisition
processes and effective oversight. To better understand the implica-
tions of this reorganization, the committee requires an objective as-
sessment of its impact on DOT&E’s mission.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to provide a briefing to the congressional defense
committees, not later than January 31, 2026, on the effects of the
DOT&E reorganization. This briefing shall include an evaluation
of: (1) The personnel adjustments and resulting organizational
structure of DOT&E; (2) The capacity of DOT&E to sustain inde-
pendent oversight of all Major Defense Acquisition Programs as re-
quired by statute under the new structure; (3) The ability of
DOT&E to conduct independent oversight of additional programs
on its oversight list, including Middle Tier Acquisition Programs,
classified programs, and those added at the discretion of the Direc-
tor or request of the Secretary of Defense; and (4) Any other rel-
evant considerations the Comptroller General deems appropriate
regarding the reorganization’s impact on DOT&E’s mission.
Comptroller General review of role of distributors in supply
chain
The committee is aware that manufacturers sometimes partner
with distributors for the sale of subsystems, components, and spare
parts to both commercial and government customers. The com-
mittee is also aware that in certain cases, such as when a part is
out of production or a manufacturer no longer supports a part, the
manufacturer may only sell the part through distributors to enable
manufacturers to focus on core business.
However, the committee is concerned that manufacturers may
have limited alternatives for parts and subcontractors in the mar-
ket, which influences their decision to enter into distributor rela-
tionships. The committee is further concerned about escalating part
pricing on weapon-system components and, in particular, sole
source spare parts for weapon systems that are out of production.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to provide a one-time report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than April 1, 2026, assessing the role of distributors in

the Department of Defense weapons system supply chain. The as-
sessment should include a statistically significant representative
sample of parts sold through distributors for weapon systems that
are in production as well as weapon systems that are no longer in
production, and should include an assessment of: (1) Any pricing
trends before and after the manufacturer established distributor
relationships for the part, taking into consideration relevant factors
such as inflation, material costs, production quantities, unique
Government requirements, and manufacturing set up costs; (2)
Why the manufacturer chose to partner with distributors; (3) Cat-
egories of terms and conditions that create undue burdens on the
supply chain such that the direct manufacturers of subsystems,
components, or spare parts may only sell through distributors; (4)
Any benefits that distributors provide, including for parts no longer
in production or with low production output; (5) The impact of
unique Government requirements on pricing of subsystems, compo-
nents, and spare parts offered through distributors; (6) Whether
distributors may apply downward pressure on part pricing, such as
through competition of one or more distributors or by placing or-
ders in higher quantities than manufacturers would otherwise keep
as stock on hand; (7) Whether the part is a commercial product;
and (8) Any other matters the Comptroller General deems nec-
essary.
Department of Defense battery strategy
The committee is aware that section 883 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) required the Sec-
retary of Defense to establish a Department of Defense-wide bat-
tery strategy, coordinated with the military services, to identify
and address the risks to the defense supply chain and material
shortages for legacy system batteries. The committee believes that
the strategy should also look forward with a plan for transitioning
the Department to safer batteries with higher energy capabilities
with opportunities for supply chain growth. Currently, the com-
mittee understands that the Department is working not only to
standardize battery requirements across the military services but
also to look forward at advancements in battery technology and
how to leverage commercial industry investment for defense needs.
The committee notes that some of these advancements include
fast-charging battery technology, with availability for Arctic condi-
tions. Significant investment continues to be made in the domestic
battery supply chain, and the committee encourages the Depart-
ment to prioritize batteries manufactured and sourced within the
United States or through allied partner nations pursuant to estab-
lished defense trade agreements. Innovation in cell and pack devel-
opment and manufacturing, pursued within a standardization ori-
entation, could lead to warfighter and platform superiority as well
as increase demand and predictability for the Department’s re-
quirements while ensuring consistent domestic supply and reduced
costs.
As the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense of Acquisition
and Sustainment, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Research and Engineering, and the military services work together

to standardize battery procurement, strategy, and innovation, the
committee encourages the consideration of the following: (1) The
ability of batteries to operate and recharge at temperatures as low
as ¥75°F; (2) Possible approaches for the creation and develop-
ment of cell, pack, and supply-chain and manufacturing innovation
and infrastructure; and (3) Existing efforts by the Office of Naval
Research on a seawater-activated lithium-ion battery that may pos-
sess more power than commercial alternatives. The committee
looks forward to the continued partnership with the Department on
ensuring advanced and standardized battery options for the
warfighter that come from domestic or allied sources.
Department of Defense coordination with broader chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threats
The committee understands the critical role that the Department
of Defense (DOD) has in broader Federal Government and private
sector efforts to address chemical, biological, radiological, and nu-
clear (CBRN) threats as well as emerging infectious diseases. The
Department possesses unique capabilities that contribute to inter-
agency efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks of infec-
tious disease worldwide. It is important for the Department to
prioritize and align investments in medical countermeasures
among all Federal stakeholders to ensure that effective counter-
measures are developed and to avoid duplication of efforts across
agencies.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Department to lever-
age private industry expertise to meet these requirements, to in-
crease efforts to coordinate capabilities at organizations with DOD
CBRN priorities, and to coordinate with civilian priorities through
the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enter-
prise.
Department of Defense supply chain mapping efforts
The committee remains concerned that there are far too many
places where the Department of Defense (DOD) and the defense in-
dustrial base are reliant on single sources of supply or adversary
sources for key components, subcomponents, critical minerals, and
raw materials. The committee is aware of several ongoing efforts
within the DOD to create internal supply chain mapping tools, as
well as efforts to contract for commercial products and services to
improve supply chain illumination across the Department. In work-
ing toward a more robust and resilient industrial base, the Depart-
ment should consolidate around one supply chain mapping tool
rather than working separately, in silos, on the problem.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on a supply chain
mapping strategy. This strategy should include: (1) An assessment
of existing supply chain mapping or illumination capabilities devel-
oped by or contracted for the Department; (2) Progress on the Sup-
ply Chain Risk Evaluation Environment (SCREEn) implementa-
tion, including any challenges with expansion; (3) An assessment
of commercially available tools that may be used to complement or
supplement SCREEn; (4) Any additional supply chain illumination

efforts ongoing within the Department; (5) An assessment of the
Department’s capability to utilize existing tools to determine coun-
try of origin for materials and single points of failure; and (6) Any
additional resources required to support the Department in improv-
ing supply chain mapping and illumination Department-wide. The
briefing may include a classified annex if required.
Efforts to accelerate bioindustrial manufacturing innova-
tion
The committee recognizes the importance of bioindustrial manu-
facturing capabilities as essential to maintaining the United States’
national security and global competitiveness. Biotechnology and
biomanufacturing provide innovative tools and capabilities that di-
rectly support Department of Defense (DOD) missions, strengthen
domestic supply chains, and reduce reliance on foreign sources for
critical materials. The committee is encouraged by DOD invest-
ments in a Bioindustrial Manufacturing Innovation Institute called
BioMADE. Despite substantial federal funding, slow deployment of
industry support risks placing the United States at a competitive
disadvantage compared to nations such as China, India, and coun-
tries within Europe that are rapidly advancing their own biomanu-
facturing capabilities.
The committee acknowledges the National Security Commission
on Emerging Biotechnology’s recommendations for Congress to
work with the DOD to ensure that BioMADE is using previously
appropriated funds effectively and quickly to establish facilities as
a part of a network of precommercial facilities, while also estab-
lishing clear mechanisms for collaboration and the leveraging of
these investments with other federal agencies.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than March 1, 2026, on the progress of the BioMADE manufac-
turing institute. The briefing shall include: (1) A timeline outlining
BioMADE’s plans to obligate and expend all remaining DOD-pro-
vided funds allocated, including timelines for issuing requests for
proposals, selecting sites, and initiating construction or partnership
activities; (2) A detailed description of the selection criteria
BioMADE uses when implementing DOD funding to support infra-
structure and workforce development investments; and (3) An ac-
counting of how DOD-provided funds and those collected through
BioMADE membership fees or other cost-sharing arrangements
have been utilized by the institute to date, specifying funded
projects, partnerships established, outcomes achieved thus far, and
how these expenditures align with broader DOD strategic objec-
tives in biomanufacturing.
Feasibility and advisability of a critical minerals index
The committee recognizes that the fluctuations of the critical
minerals market significantly impact private investment in non-
commodity materials. Without stable pricing, growth of the domes-
tic critical and strategic materials industry may not be able to meet
the Department of Defense’s requirements.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Industrial Base Policy to brief the Committees on Armed

Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than April 1, 2026, on the feasibility and advisability of estab-
lishing a price index for certain strategic and critical materials.
The briefing shall include but not be limited to: (1) A determination
of strategic and critical materials in shortfall for the National De-
fense Stockpile or currently under any trade or export restrictions
by a foreign entity of concern; (2) An assessment, in consultation
with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), of
how the Assistant Secretary could determine the maximum accept-
able exponential acquisition price for the materials; (3) A plan for
how the indexes could be utilized for the National Defense Stock-
pile or any other Department material acquisitions or investments;
(4) An analysis on the most appropriate forecasting capability, and
any potential for collaboration with private sector market partici-
pants through the Open Price Exploration for National Security
project of DARPA; and (5) Any other materials the Secretary deter-
mines relevant.
Feasibility and advisability of establishing biosurveillance
network at United States embassies and military instal-
lations overseas
The committee notes that the Department of Defense is con-
ducting ongoing efforts to improve infectious disease surveillance,
prevention, and response capability to better protect the health of
the Armed Forces across the world. With existing Department of
Defense capabilities, there could be opportunities to enhance the
biosurveillance networks through working with the interagency.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of State, to brief the Senate Armed
Services Committee, not later than June 1, 2026, on the feasibility
and advisability of expanding existing biosurveillance efforts to es-
tablish networks at U.S. embassies and military installations over-
seas. The briefing should include: (1) The feasibility and advis-
ability of expanding existing biosurveillance efforts to U.S. embas-
sies, including a cost assessment; (2) A review of military and dip-
lomatic facilities under the jurisdiction or control of the United
States that could be ideal candidates for an expanded biosurveil-
lance network based on the proximity of the facilities to high-risk
research, biological weapons research, geographic zoonotic spillover
risk, and the public health surveillance capacity in the country
where the facility is located; (3) Data protections required at the
potential locations to protect privacy and medical data; (4) A deter-
mination regarding the redundancy of this effort with ongoing De-
partment efforts in biosurveillance; and (5) Any other matters the
Secretary of Defense determines relevant.
Government Accountability Office defense industrial base
review
The committee is concerned about the Department of Defense’s
efforts to improve how it identifies and mitigates risks to the de-
fense industrial base. For many years, the Department did not
have a consolidated or comprehensive strategy to address indus-
trial base risks. In its report published on July 7, 2022, titled ‘‘De-
fense Industrial Base: DOD Should Take Actions to Strengthen Its

Risk Mitigation Approach,’’ the Government Accountability Office
reported that the Department lacked such a strategy and did not
have performance measures to monitor the effectiveness of its miti-
gation efforts (GAO–22–104154). Further, the report found that the
Department struggled to report its progress in Annual Industrial
Capability Reports. In 2024, the Department issued its first Na-
tional Defense Industrial Strategy and corresponding implementa-
tion plan. Together, these documents provide a roadmap for the De-
partment’s efforts to mitigate industrial base risks. However, the
extent to which the Department is implementing this strategy is
unclear.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a review of the Department’s current ef-
forts to mitigate risks to the defense industrial base. This review
should examine: (1) The Department’s actions to implement the
National Defense Industrial Strategy, including steps taken to link
the strategy to other efforts across the Department; (2) The status
of the Department’s effort to provide resources for planned and on-
going risk mitigation activities; (3) The Department’s progress in
mitigating industrial base risks; and (4) Any other information the
Comptroller General determines appropriate with respect to de-
fense industrial base risk mitigation. The committee directs the
Comptroller General to provide a briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than June 1, 2026, with a report to fol-
low at a date agreed upon at the time.
Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene supply chain
The committee remains strongly supportive of the establishment
of the Joint Energetics Transition Office, mandated by the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–
31), and of the requirement for the Department of Defense to de-
velop a strategic plan and investment plan for incorporating novel
energetic materials into new and existing programs. The unaccept-
able delays in creating the office are preventing the Department of
Defense from identifying shortfalls in the supply chain for energetic
materials and developing plans to alleviate these issues. For exam-
ple, the committee understands that the supply chain of hydroxyl-
terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) is very fragile and relies on one
single production facility in the United States. HTPB is the pri-
mary binder that holds fuel together in solid rocket motors. With-
out it, the United States cannot adequately produce solid rocket
motors without relying on foreign sources. The committee also un-
derstands that enhanced derivatives of HTPB offer improved per-
formance characteristics, including increased energy output, sta-
bility, and manufacturability, which are essential for maintaining
technological superiority in propulsion and energetics over our ad-
versaries.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2026, on: (1)
An assessment of the current shortfalls in domestic HTPB produc-
tion capacity and supply chain risks associated with HTPB produc-
tion; (2) A summary of ongoing and planned efforts to enhance do-
mestic manufacturing and innovation in HTPB-related tech-

nologies, including efforts to improve performance and
manufacturability; and (3) Opportunities to enter into contracts,
grants, or cooperative agreements with domestic manufacturers to
sustain and expand production capacity of both traditional and en-
hanced HTPB.
Organic industrial base governance
The committee understands the critical importance of the organic
industrial base to ensuring the Nation has the supply of critical
munitions it requires to deter, and, if necessary, fight and win our
Nation’s wars. The committee commends the Army’s recent efforts
to modernize the organic industrial base but remains aware of mul-
tiple deficiencies within the organic industrial base. Many of these
facilities are now sustaining obsolete platforms or being forced to
find alternate commercial work, in part because there is no coher-
ent, centralized plan to guide their workload and modernization ef-
forts. The organic industrial base’s governance is fractured across
multiple commands and functions, including the Army Materiel
Command who owns and operates the facilities and the Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology
(ASA(ALT)) who funds the majority of workload and acquisition
priorities. Further, the use of the Army Working Capital Fund pre-
vents the kind of sustained investment that is required to properly
modernize the organic industrial base. To that end, the committee
recognizes that the Army requires an effective, efficient governance
and resourcing model to ensure the organic industrial base is mod-
ernized and expanded to meet our Nation’s military requirements.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, with the following information: (1) An analysis of the Army
Working Capital Fund’s impact on the operating and production
costs for each facility, with a focus on government-owned, govern-
ment-operated facilities; (2) A cost-benefit analysis of moving away
from the Army Working Capital Fund model and instead utilizing
direct appropriations, or a hybrid approach; (3) A breakout by rel-
evant budget accounts of workload at each organic industrial base
facility; (4) An analysis and explanation of how the Army ensures
the workloads for each site are in line with broader Army produc-
tion and maintenance goals, including an assessment of the feasi-
bility of establishing an annual workload plan that integrates input
from each of the program executive offices; (5) The advisability of
implementing the recommendation from the Army Science Board’s
September 2023 report, ‘‘Surge Capacity in the Defense Munitions
Industrial Base,’’ which said that, ‘‘A single authority for munitions
be assigned, reporting to the ASA(ALT), to assist in the Single
Manager for Conventional Ammunition role and to oversee and ad-
vise on capital investments, Science and Technology investments,
and new manufacturing advances’’; (6) An explanation of how the
integration of Joint Munitions Command into Army Sustainment
Command will impact organic industrial base governance; and (7)
An explanation of how the Joint Energetics Transition Office will
interact with the organic industrial base.

Predictive manufacturing analytics at Army depots
The committee applauds the military departments for their ef-
forts to modernize the organic industrial base and encourages the
military departments to continue collaborating with the Nation’s
digital manufacturing institute on this endeavor. The committee
urges the continued implementation of industrial control networks
across our Army’s arsenals, depots, and plants to enable the collec-
tion, aggregation, and analysis of data associated with the manu-
facture and repair of equipment and supplies. This investment is
a foundational element to achieve digital transformation of the
Army’s organic industrial base and prepare these government-
owned industrial facilities for wartime production and support.
Rapid hull production of unmanned vessels
The committee recognizes that investing in additive manufac-
turing approaches, such as large format polymer additive manufac-
turing, could enable production of unmanned systems at scale.
Such flexible approaches could enable a single machine to fabricate
hull structures for multiple different missions in days versus
months, supporting the proliferation of low-cost, expendable, or
attritable platforms compared to traditional manufacturing meth-
ods. These capabilities align innovation and modernization efforts,
addressing demands for rapid, scalable production in contested en-
vironments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.
The committee further encourages the Department of Defense to
look for opportunities to transition proven research in robotic ad-
vanced manufacturing to the defense industrial base in order to re-
duce production time and costs, enhance workforce efficiency, and
strengthen overall domestic manufacturing capacity. The com-
mittee also believes such efforts can radically increase operational
effectiveness of maintenance activities under contested logistics
scenarios by pushing such activities closer to the forward edges of
conflict, rather than at the end of long and untenable logistics sup-
ply lines within the continental United States.
The committee encourages the Department to invest in and im-
plement relevant advanced manufacturing capabilities such as
large-format polymer additive manufacturing within the defense in-
dustrial base. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 1, 2026, regarding the Department’s plans to in-
corporate additive manufacturing methods, techniques, and proc-
esses for production and manufacturing of unmanned vessels.
Report on addressing acquisition and merger review short-
falls
The committee is concerned that the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy (ASD IBP) does not
have adequate resourcing or personnel to monitor mergers and ac-
quisitions, especially for sub-tier suppliers in the defense industrial
base. The committee directs the ASD IBP to provide a report to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on actions to implement the Government Account-
ability Office’s recommendations in its report titled ‘‘Defense Indus-
trial Base: DOD Needs Better Insight into Risks from Mergers and

report should include but not be limited to: (1) The actions the ASD
IBP will take to ensure the office is adequately staffed to review
all mergers and acquisitions associated with all major defense sup-
pliers, including any required resources necessary to do so; and (2)
How it will monitor and mitigate the risks associated with those
transactions, including any required resources to do so.
Review of reporting requirements
The committee understands that statutory reporting require-
ments, while valuable at the time, may ultimately become less val-
uable over time.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2026, a one-
time list of statutory reporting requirements with no sunset date
which the Secretary determines provide little or no value for con-
sideration of termination.
Review of sole source awards in cloud computing con-
tracting
The committee is concerned that as the Department of Defense
(DOD) increasingly transitions to commercial cloud computing en-
vironments for critical data processing and networking infrastruc-
ture, it is becoming more dependent on a small number of pro-
viders. Continuing challenges in processes and protocols to effec-
tively operate across single cloud infrastructures and manage
multi-cloud environments exacerbate this concentration. The com-
mittee believes this convergence introduces risks of technological
stove-piping, reduction of competition, and balkanization within
DOD networks. However, the committee also recognizes that such
impressions may also be based more on anecdotal observation rath-
er than any firm analysis of Department-wide data and docu-
mented behavior.
Therefore, the committee directs the DOD Inspector General to
conduct a review of the instances of sole source awards within the
cloud computing contracting sphere and to provide a briefing on the
results of this review to the congressional defense committees, not
later than June 1, 2026. Such review should examine the sole
source task orders awarded by the DOD heads of contracting over
the past 3 years to determine if there are any discernible trends
and to compare such trends against similar sole source awards for
other types of contracting. This review should also examine the sole
source justifications and approval and market research documents
to determine their thoroughness. Finally, the review should make
some assessment if the trends identified in the review point to any
systemic concerns regarding competition and make recommenda-
tions regarding means to mitigate any concerns identified.
Silica fabric manufacturing
The committee acknowledges the critical importance of safe-
guarding shipbuilding and repair operations from fire and extreme
heat. These operations demand robust protection not only for costly
equipment and shipyard infrastructure but also for the workforce

engaged in high-risk activities such as welding, cutting, and grind-
ing. As domestic defense manufacturing has expanded, the demand
for advanced thermal protection materials, including silica fabric,
has increased significantly.
The committee is concerned that the domestic industrial base for
silica fabric is limited, with only two U.S. producers of silica fabric
and one domestic supplier of the requisite fiberglass yarn. This con-
strained supply chain poses potential risks to national defense
readiness. The committee is also concerned that the Department of
Defense continues to choose to place orders of silica fabric products
made in China instead of the United States; since February of 2025
the Department of the Navy chose to award Chinese-based manu-
facturers over U.S. manufacturers for delivery of carbon silica fab-
ric. To address this vulnerability, the committee urges the Depart-
ment of Defense to invest in U.S.-made silica fabric, to prioritize
investment in downstream requirements for silica fabric, and to
bolster the existing domestic production capacity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Industrial Base Policy to deliver a briefing to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than March 1, 2026. The
briefing shall address the following: (1) Current efforts to procure
silica-based fabrics for defense applications; (2) The rationale for
choosing Chinese-made silica fabric over U.S.-made silica fabric; (3)
Challenges encountered in securing silica-based fabrics; and (4)
Strategic plans to invest in and strengthen the silica fabric indus-
trial base in the United States to mitigate identified challenges.
Small Business Innovation Research to support organic in-
dustrial base
The committee is aware that the Army’s Small Business Innova-
tion Research (SBIR) program partnered with Letterkenny Army
Depot to develop open topic solicitations for mobile sustainment
tools, shop tools and enablers, and to reverse engineer equipment
to help address these priority areas of the organic industrial base.
While SBIR is primarily used for emerging technology, there are
significant opportunities to use SBIR to tailor emerging technology
with sustainment requirements to better support depots across the
enterprise. The committee encourages all of the military services to
facilitate integration of innovative solutions by conducting SBIR
topics to meet manufacturing process improvement needs.
Small business support for Cybersecurity Maturity Model
Certification requirements
The committee acknowledges the critical importance of safe-
guarding Department of Defense (DOD) sensitive information while
ensuring small businesses can continue to participate in the de-
fense industrial base. The committee recognizes that the Cyberse-
curity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program, while nec-
essary for national security, presents potential significant financial
and technical challenges for small businesses. The committee notes
that assessments conducted by Certified Third-Party Assessment
Organizations are estimated to cost between $45,000 and $100,000
depending on the size and scope of a business. While the policy al-
lows for small businesses to continue to self-certify without requir-

ing third-party assessment, there still exists some barrier to entry
for small contractors to comply. The committee believes this cost
burden has the potential to restrict competition and limit DOD ac-
cess to innovative solutions from non-traditional vendors if the De-
partment does not take sufficient action to help support and men-
tor such providers through this process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Department of Defense
Chief Information Officer, in coordination with the Director for the
Department of Defense Office of Small Business Programs, to pro-
vide the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives a report on a comprehensive small busi-
ness cybersecurity support strategy, not later than January 31,

Section 17:
2026. Such a strategy should support the implementation of the
CMMC program to balance security requirements with accessibility
and affordability.
Under this strategy, the committee encourages the Department
of Defense to pursue innovative approaches to reduce compliance
costs, including shared assessment resources, tiered evaluation
pathways based on contract sensitivity, and alignment with exist-
ing cybersecurity frameworks such as the National Institute of
Standards and Technology Special Publication 800–171, as re-
quired by section 1712 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263). The
strategy should also include practical, shareable resources for small
businesses, such as user-friendly self-assessment tools that provide
clear, actionable guidance for small businesses preparing for
CMMC certification and mentoring support through existing pro-
grams such as the APEX Accelerators or the DOD Mentor-Prote´ge´
Program. The committee also believes this implementation process
should evaluate the option of creating a grace period for small busi-
nesses to complete CMMC requirements after their contract award,
provided they demonstrate a good-faith effort toward compliance,
as well as the potential to make such costs allowable contract costs
for small businesses.
Streamline authorities to establish Navy rapid capabilities
office
The committee commends the Army and the Air Force for estab-
lishing rapid capabilities offices to quickly deliver novel capabilities
to the warfighter at speed and scale. The committee also notes that

Section 18:
section 215 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) established a Naval Air Warfare
Rapid Capabilities Office. However, the committee is concerned
that the Navy has not fully implemented and utilized this office.
The committee also believes that the Navy should seek to estab-
lish similar rapid capability offices for the surface and undersea do-
mains, among other strategic capability priorities for the Navy and
Joint Force. The committee is encouraged by the Navy’s initial ef-
forts but remains concerned about the pace and broader implemen-
tation of these initiatives across the Service. Therefore, the com-
mittee directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide a report, not
later than March 1, 2026, on the following:

bility-like offices at the Service-wide level to facilitate the rapid
and iterative development and deployment of surface and un-
dersea capabilities. This plan should include and consider:
a. How to optimize and integrate relevant existing Navy
organizations, such as Project Overmatch, NavalX, and
other similar initiatives, into a rapid capabilities office to
eliminate redundancy and streamline rapid acquisition
workflows across the Navy;
b. A framework to advance collaboration with program
executive officers, the Defense Innovation Unit, and other
Department of Defense innovation hubs to ensure fielding
of accelerated capabilities into the Navy’s acquisition eco-
system; and
c. An assessment of the potential benefits and risks asso-
ciated with such an office, including potential impacts on
ongoing programs and statutory authorities; and
(4) Any additional information the Secretary of the Navy
finds appropriate, including recommendations for changes to
statute that would support the effective operation of a rapid ca-
pabilities office.
The report shall be unclassified but may have a classified annex
if necessary.
Study on contracting official workload
The committee recognizes the critical role of the Department of
Defense (DOD) acquisition workforce in supporting the National
Defense Strategy by ensuring timely, effective, and efficient pro-
curement of capabilities for the warfighter. The committee ac-
knowledges the complexity of DOD contracting processes and the
need for the workforce to meet evolving demands while maintain-
ing accountability and fairness in the use of taxpayer dollars.
The committee notes that the DOD cut its civilian acquisition
workforce nearly in half between 1989 and 1999, as the Govern-
ment Accountability Office (GAO) published in a report on April 26,
2002, titled ‘‘Acquisition Workforce: Department of Defense’s Plans
to Address Workforce Size and Structure Challenges’’ (GAO–02–
630). The DOD further decreased the military and civilian acquisi-
tion workforce 15 percent between 1998 and 2008, to 126,000 total
personnel, as the GAO published in an August 15, 2019, report ti-
tled ‘‘Defense Acquisition Workforce: DOD Increased Use of Human
Capital Flexibilities but Could Improve Monitoring’’ (GAO–19–509),
during a time when contract obligations more than doubled in con-
stant dollars. While the acquisition workforce has increased to
roughly 180,000, the committee is concerned that the acquisition
workforce in general, and the contracting workforce specifically,
has not kept pace with the workload they are assigned.

To better understand the contracting workforce and the processes
they follow, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment to commission a one-time study on
the DOD contracting workforce, to be delivered to the congressional
defense committees, not later than March 1, 2026. The report
should provide an analysis of contracting processes and opportuni-
ties for improvement. Additionally, the report should include: (1)
An assessment of the historical workload for the DOD contracting
official, including the average dollar value and number of contract
actions per contracting official; (2) An assessment of the years of
age and years of service within the contracting workforce by role
and warrant levels; (3) An examination of the steps DOD con-
tracting officials take to award different types of contracts, includ-
ing large, complex contracts and smaller, modular contracts with
performance-based statements of work; (4) An identification of ex-
ternal dependencies that impact contract award timelines and an
evaluation of the potential to convert sequential contracting tasks
into parallel processes by enhancing stakeholder collaboration, in-
cluding recommendations for implementation; (5) A comparison
with commercial industry practices, including benchmarks for how
industry contracting officers measure success, efficiency, and proc-
ess effectiveness; and (6) Recommendations for the DOD about the
size of the contracting officer community and metrics to measure
the workload and productivity of contracting officers.

TITLE IX—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Subtitle A—Office of the Secretary of Defense and Related
Matters
Sec. 901—Economic Defense Unit
The committee recommends a provision that would establish an
Economic Defense Unit (EDU) to centralize requirements genera-
tion, programming, planning coordination, and execution oversight
of economic competition activities at the Department of Defense
(DOD). The EDU would report directly to the Deputy Secretary of
Defense and act as the Principal Staff Assistant to the Secretary
of Defense on all matters related to economic competition. The pro-
vision would amend other authorities to make the EDU co-chair
the National Security Capital Forum and chair the National De-
fense Economic Competition Research Council.
The committee strongly believes that enhanced coordination in
the economic competition space can drastically improve the ability
of the DOD to counter adversary defense industrial base activities,
counter adversary mobilization activities, and secure access, bas-
ing, and overflight opportunities for the U.S. military. The Depart-
ment possesses a significant number of programs and authorities
in this space, which, while individually impressive, are rarely co-
ordinated to requirements or harmonized into campaign plans with
layered effects. A non-exhaustive list of relevant entities involved
in economic competition at the Department of Defense includes the
Office of Strategic Capital, U.S. Special Operations Command, and
numerous organizations within the offices of the Secretary of the
Air Force, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Security, and
the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment. Further,
dozens of innovative U.S. commercial entities are actively working
in this space and can bring significant capability to bear with little
to no taxpayer funding. Additionally, the DOD currently does a
poor job informing the U.S. interagency of its activities in this
space or sharing intelligence with the U.S. interagency for potential
prosecution of targets using non-DOD authorities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Deputy Secretary of De-
fense to brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than
January 15, 2026, on a plan to implement the Economic Defense
Unit.
Sec. 902—Additional authorities for Office of Strategic Cap-
ital
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 149 of title 10, United States Code, and authorize the Office
of Strategic Capital (OSC) to collect fees for the costs of services
(175)

provided by the Office and associated with administering OSC loan
programs, including for project-specific transaction costs and direct
costs relating to such services. Further, this provision would re-
quire the Director of the OSC to provide an annual report on how
those fees were allocated. The provision also would require an
audit by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense at
least once every 2 years.
Sec. 903—Modifications to responsibilities of Director for
Operational Test and Evaluation
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 139(b) of title 10, United States Code, to require the Director
for Operational Test and Evaluation to maintain, on behalf of the
Secretary of Defense, certain enabling and cross-cutting activities
that support operational test and evaluation across the Department
of Defense.
Sec. 904—Directive authority for matters for which Under
Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has
responsibility
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 133a(b) of title 10, United States Code, by granting directive
authority for research and development matters to the Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Research and Engineering.
The committee notes that before the split of the Under Secretary
of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) into
two separate organizations, the Under Secretary of Defense for
AT&L had specific authorities to be able to weigh in, and if nec-
essary, halt the services’ research and development efforts if they
were not realizing the original goals set forth by the Office of the
Secretary of Defense. Under the current statute, section 133a of
title 10, United States Code, only the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment has such authority. This provision
would provide the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and
Engineering with a similar authority and bring parity between the
two organizations.
Sec. 905—Modification of energetic materials strategic plan
and investment strategy of Joint Energetics Transition
Office
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 148(c)(1) of title 10, United States Code, to add a new element
for the energetic materials strategic plan and investment strategy
of the Joint Energetics Transition Office to identify raw material
waste produced during the explosives manufacturing process and to
develop plans to reduce waste and optimize production.
Sec. 906—Limitation on availability of funds pending estab-
lishment of Joint Energetics Transition Office
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of not more than 90 percent of Operation and
Maintenance, Defense-wide funds authorized to be appropriated or
otherwise made available for fiscal year 2026 for travel expenses
for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and

Research and Engineering until the Secretary of Defense notifies
the congressional defense committees that the Department of De-
fense has established the Joint Energetics Transition Office as re-
quired by section 148 of title 10, United States Code, and provides
that Office with the staff and resources necessary to carry out its
responsibilities.
Sec. 907—Modification of covered technology categories for
Office of Strategic Capital
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 149 of title 10, United States Code, to add nuclear fission and
fusion energy, and associated infrastructure, including advanced
nuclear reactors, to the list of covered technologies eligible for sup-
port by the Office of Strategic Capital.
Sec. 908—Modification of organization and authorities of As-
sistant Secretaries of Defense with duties relating to in-
dustrial base policy and readiness
The committee recommends a provision that would create a new
Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Armaments Co-
operation, eliminate the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readi-
ness, and rename the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy,
Plans, and Capabilities as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Strategy, Plans, Capabilities, and Readiness.
Subtitle B—Other Department of Defense Organization and
Management Matters
Sec. 911—Modifications to Joint Requirements Oversight
Council
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 181 of title 10, United States Code, by modifying the respon-
sibilities of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and make
conforming amendments.
Sec. 912—Transfer of responsibility for countering small un-
manned aircraft systems
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 133b(b)(5) of title 10, United States Code, to transfer the re-
sponsibility for Countering small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C–
sUAS) from the Department of the Army to the Under Secretary
of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.
The committee notes that this change highlights the committee’s
continued emphasis on the importance of the C–sUAS program and
puts the management and synchronization responsibility at the ap-
propriate level in the Department of Defense.
Sec. 913—Study on feasibility and advisability of estab-
lishing a Joint Capabilities and Programming Board
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a study on the feasibility and ad-
visability of establishing a Joint Capabilities and Programming
Board within the Department of Defense to enhance joint military

capability prioritization and program budgeting. The study would
evaluate the Board’s proposed structure, including its co-chair lead-
ership by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation
and the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council; its
membership, including the military services and acquisition execu-
tives; its decision-making processes, which would include dis-
senting opinions; and its dedicated staff support. The study would
also assess integrating the Board with existing Department of De-
fense entities, as well as implementation challenges and potential
benefits versus drawbacks. The Secretary of Defense would be re-
quired to submit a report on the contents of the study to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than July 1, 2026.
Sec. 914—Briefing on restructuring of Army Futures Com-
mand and Training and Doctrine Command
The committee directs the Secretary of Army to provide a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, prior to the expenditure of the funds authorized
to be appropriated to restructure commands, on its proposed plan
to combine Army Futures and Training and Doctrine Commands.
Sec. 915—Designation of senior official for military-to-civil-
ian transition
The committee recommends a provision that would designate a
senior official responsible for overseeing servicemember transition
from active duty to civilian life or reserve components.
Sec. 916—Removal of members of Joint Chiefs of Staff
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 151 of title 10, United States Code, to require the President
to notify Congress of the removal of a member of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff from office or transfer to another position or location before
the end of the member’s term of office not later than 5 days after
the removal or transfer takes place.
Sec. 917—Longer term and eligibility for appointment to
rank of Admiral of Commander of Naval Sea Systems
Command
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 526 of title 10, United States Code, to establish an 8-year term
for the Commander of Naval Sea Systems Command and authorize
eligibility for appointment to the rank of Admiral during the final
3 years of that term. The provision would also require a report
from the Secretary of the Navy on options and incentives to pro-
mote private investment in new shipyard capacity on the Pacific
Coast.
Sec. 918—Delay of disestablishment of Navy Expeditionary
Combat Command Pacific
The committee recommends a provision that would provide a 1-
year delay in execution of any Navy plans to disestablish the Navy
Expeditionary Combat Command Pacific.

commands
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the
availability of funds to consolidate, disestablish, or otherwise elimi-
nate a geographic combatant command of the Department of De-
fense until not earlier than 90 days after the Secretary of Defense
submits an analysis to the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 920—Elimination of statutory provisions relating to di-
versity, equity, and inclusion in the Department of De-
fense
The committee recommends a provision that would strike various
statutory requirements and other provisions in United States Code
related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Sec. 921—Defense Science Board study on optimal organiza-
tional structure for digital engineering solutions
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to require the Defense Science Board to con-
duct a comprehensive study on the optimal organizational struc-
ture within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to support digital
solutions engineering activities.
Sec. 922—Establishment of Advanced Nuclear Transition
Working Group
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to establish an Advanced Nuclear Transition
Working Group that would identify critical energy requirements
that may be addressed with advanced nuclear reactors and develop
and execute a strategy to acquire them.
Items of Special Interest
Civilian oversight and advocacy for special operations
forces
The committee remains strongly supportive of the ‘‘service sec-
retary-like’’ role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special
Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict for oversight of and advo-
cacy for special operations forces (SOF). The joint posture state-
ment submitted to the committee by the Assistant Secretary and
the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM),
states, ‘‘The success of SOF is strengthened by the close civilian-
military partnership between [the Assistant Secretary] and the
Commander, [SOCOM]. Our partnership strengthens America’s
warfighting edge for the Joint Force. In its service secretary-like
role, [the Assistant Secretary] is a force-multiplier for SOF’s readi-
ness, fiscal responsibility, and sustainability . . . [Special Oper-
ations and Low-Intensity Conflict] requires the requisite tools,
workforce, and resources to accelerate the implementation of these
priorities and enable SOF to be the most effective, disciplined, and
strategically relevant force it can be.’’

922 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017
(Public Law 114–328) and subsequent reforms, have played a crit-
ical role in enabling the operational success and transformation of
SOF to meet current and future challenges without adding bu-
reaucracy. The committee urges the Department of Defense to suf-
ficiently staff and resource the Office of the Assistant Secretary to
meet his or her responsibilities under section 138(b)(2)(A) of title
10, United States Code, including through the establishment of a
permanent Senior Enlisted Advisor and the allocation of additional
military personnel to ensure operational perspectives are appro-
priately represented.
Furthermore, the committee encourages the Secretary of Defense
to expeditiously complete the actions required by section 907 of the
Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) to en-
able the further institutionalization of the Assistant Secretary. The
committee directs the Secretary, not later than October 1, 2025,
and quarterly thereafter, to provide the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives with up-
date briefings on each line of effort established under section 907
of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–
159) until each such activity is completed.

TITLE X—GENERAL PROVISIONS
Subtitle A—Financial Matters
Sec. 1001—General transfer authority
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $6.0 billion of fiscal year
2026 funds authorized in division A of this Act to unforeseen high-
er priority needs in accordance with normal reprogramming proce-
dures. Transfers of funds between military personnel authoriza-
tions would not be counted toward the dollar limitation in this pro-
vision.
Sec. 1002—Amendments and repeals to budgetary require-
ments for defense acquisition
The committee recommends a provision that would repeal certain
budgetary requirements for Department of Defense acquisition pro-
grams. The provision amends requirements for budget displays
from the following: section 141 of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111–84) for body armor
procurement; section 2284 of title 10, United States Code, for the
Explosive Ordnance Disposal Defense Program; section 219 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public
Law 113–66) for the Distributed Common Ground System; section
213 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2011 (Public Law 111–383) for the Joint Light Tactical Ve-
hicle; and sections 111, 214, and 1502 of the Duncan Hunter Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law
110–417) for Future Combat Systems, Sky Warrior Unmanned Aer-
ial Systems, and Afghanistan and Iraq operations, respectively.
Sec. 1003—Briefing on beginning balance issues for audit
purposes
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to deliver a one-time
briefing to the congressional defense committees on any anticipated
issues in establishing beginning balances for audits of the financial
statements of the Department of Defense. The briefing, due not
later than March 1, 2026, should include: (1) An identification of
each budgetary account expected to have unsupported beginning
balances; (2) A description of the issues preventing beginning bal-
ances from being established for each account; (3) An explanation
of whether beginning balances could be established through gen-
erally accepted accounting principles and, if not, the other methods
that could be used to resolve the issues; and (4) The projected im-
pact to receiving an unmodified audit opinion of that account with-
out a supported beginning balance.

The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 240g(b) of title 10, United States Code, to eliminate the semi-
annual briefing requirement and to bring the annual reporting date
in line with the due date of the audited financial statements out-
lined in section 240a of title 10, United States Code.
Subtitle B—Naval Vessels
Sec. 1011—Requirements related to Medium Landing Ships
and Light Replenishment Oilers
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Navy, in implementing the Medium Landing Ship and Light Re-
plenishment Oiler programs, to utilize a Vessel Construction Man-
ager (VCM) acquisition strategy, employing commercial design
standards, construction practices, and an external entity to con-
tract for construction. This approach aims to maximize cost effi-
ciency and leverage proven commercial construction methodologies
for non-warship naval vessels.
The VCM acquisition strategy, as demonstrated by the Maritime
Administration’s National Security Multi-Mission Vessels (NSMV)
program, has yielded significant cost savings and operational effi-
ciencies. The NSMV, built using commercial design and contracting
processes, has achieved a cost of approximately $300.0 million per
ship, compared to an estimated $750.0 million to $900.0 million per
ship, if the Navy were to use traditional Navy shipbuilding require-
ments and Department of Defense contracting processes. By uti-
lizing off-the-shelf commercial technology and streamlined con-
tracting using a third-party entity, the VCM approach reduces bu-
reaucratic overhead, accelerates delivery schedules, and ensures
vessels meet mission requirements without the cost premiums as-
sociated with military-specific standards, making it particularly
suitable for naval logistics and support vessels that do not include
complex weapon systems.
The committee recognizes the potential for broader application of
the VCM strategy to enhance the outcomes in the Navy’s ship-
building portfolio. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of
the Navy to submit a briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 31, 2026, identifying additional vessel
classes, such as hospital ships, cable layers, and logistic supply
ships, that could benefit from the VCM acquisition strategy. The
report shall include recommendations for integrating VCM into fu-
ture procurement plans and strategies to overcome any institu-
tional barriers to adopting commercial practices.
Sec. 1012—Modification of authority to purchase used ves-
sels under the National Defense Sealift Fund
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2218 of title 10, United States Code, to raise the limitation on
the procurement of used sealift vessels from 10 vessels to 12.

Sec. 1013—Exemption of unmanned surface vessels and un-
manned underwater vehicles from certain technical au-
thority requirements
The committee recommends a provision that would exempt un-
manned surface vessels and unmanned underwater vehicles from
the Senior Technical Authority requirement under section 8669b of
title 10, United States Code, and limit certain technical require-
ments from the Chief Engineer of the Naval Sea Systems Com-
mand without prior approval of the program manager.
Sec. 1014—Prohibition on retiring and decommissioning
oceanographic research vessels of the Navy
The committee recommends a provision that would prevent the
Navy from retiring or decommissioning any of its oceanographic re-
search vessels until the Navy has received the delivery of a suit-
able replacement research vessel to take the place of any such ves-
sels to be retired.
The Navy’s requirement for oceanographic research vessels is six
ships, matching the current inventory. The committee understands
that the Navy may be considering retiring or decommissioning of
one or more of these vessels before any replacement vessels are
available.
The committee believes that oceanographic research vessels play
a critical role in advancing scientific understanding. This is par-
ticularly true in the Pacific Ocean, the largest and most complex
body of water on earth. These research vessels facilitate the study
of marine ecosystems, oceanic currents, climate change, marine ge-
ology and geophysics, coastal geohazards, biodiversity, fisheries
science, and much more. Given the strategic significance of the Pa-
cific Ocean, sustained oceanographic research is essential for in-
formed decision-making on international policy and national secu-
rity.
Sec. 1015—Report accompanying requests for new flights or
blocks of major shipbuilding programs
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 863 of title 10, United States Code, by adding section 8669d,
which requires the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
Congress alongside any budget request for a new flight or block of
ships under a major shipbuilding program. The report would in-
clude: (1) The results of a production readiness review detailing de-
sign completion, changes from prior authorizations, and associated
risks; (2) A certification that the review supports construction; (3)
Assessments of shipyard readiness, delivery timelines, risk man-
agement processes, and metrics; and (4) Plans for overseeing the
first ship’s construction to ensure design supports the schedule.
Sec. 1016—Report on auxiliary vessel co-production
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army, in consulta-
tion with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of
State, to provide a report on the feasibility, plans, and barriers of

Sec. 1017—Report on vessel leasing program
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to report on the extent to which the use of
vessels secured under a long-term leasing program could help meet
the Navy’s needs.
Sec. 1018—Pilot program on use of automated shipbuilding
technologies and capabilities
The committee recommends a provision that would establish a
pilot program to identify novel automated hull assembly tech-
nologies for demonstration on at least one shipbuilding program
and require the Secretary of the Navy to provide an annual report
until the pilot program finishes.
Subtitle C—Counterterrorism
Sec. 1021—Extension of prohibition on use of funds for
transfer or release of individuals detained at United
States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the
United States
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1033 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 1041 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend through December 31, 2026,
the prohibition on the use of funds provided to the Department of
Defense to transfer or release individuals detained at United States
Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States. The
provision would also clarify the detainees this section would apply
to by modifying the applicable date when detainees were required
to be held.
Sec. 1022—Extension of prohibition on use of funds to con-
struct or modify facilities in the United States to house
detainees transferred from United States Naval Station,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1034(a) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 1042 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend through December 31, 2026,
the prohibition on the use of funds provided to the Department of
Defense to construct or modify facilities in the United States to
house detainees transferred from United States Naval Station,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The provision would also make a technical
correction by removing unnecessary language from a citation.

Sec. 1023—Extension of prohibition on use of funds for
transfer or release of individuals detained at United
States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to certain
countries
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1035 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 1043 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend through December 31, 2026,
the prohibition on the use of funds provided to the Department of
Defense to transfer or release individuals detained at United States
Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to certain countries. The
provision would also direct that the term ‘‘individual detained at
Guantanamo,’’ as defined in section 1034(f)(2) of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92),
applies to this section.
Sec. 1024—Extension of prohibition on use of funds to close
or relinquish control of United States Naval Station,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1036 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2018 (Public Law 115–91), as most recently amended by section
1044 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law
118–159), to extend through the end of fiscal year 2026 the prohibi-
tion on the use of funds provided to the Department of Defense to:
(1) Close or abandon United States Naval Station, Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba; (2) Relinquish control of Guantanamo Bay to the Re-
public of Cuba; or (3) Implement a material modification to the
Treaty between the United States of America and Cuba, signed at
Washington, D.C., on May 29, 1934, which modification would con-
structively close United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.
Sec. 1025—Clarification regarding definition of individual
detained at Guantanamo
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1034(f)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92) to clarify the definition of the term
‘‘individual detained at Guantanamo’’ as defined in that section.
The committee notes the importance of clarity as it pertains to
existing law applicable to detainees held at United States Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay.
Subtitle D—Miscellaneous Authorities and Limitations
Sec. 1031—Prohibition on use of funds to support entertain-

of the project in a material manner to advance the national interest
of the People’s Republic of China.
Sec. 1032—Prohibition on destruction or scrapping of World
War II-era aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Department of Defense from scrapping or destroying any World
War II-era aircraft that remain in the custody of the Air Force.
Sec. 1033—Support for counterdrug activities and activities
to counter transnational organized crime
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 284 of title 10, United States Code, support for counterdrug ac-
tivities and activities to counter transnational organized crime, to
expand the criteria to be included in quarterly reports to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives to include: (1) The agency to which support is pro-
vided; (2) The budget; (3) A description of the arrangements for the
sustainment of the project; (4) A description of the project’s objec-
tive; and (5) Information about support provided in previous fiscal
years. The provision would also change the recipients of reports
under such section to the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1034—Senior leaders of the Department of Defense and
other specified persons: authority to provide protection
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 714 of title 10, United States Code, to require enhanced notifi-
cations to the congressional defense committees when the Secretary
of Defense makes determinations with respect to providing physical
protection and security to former senior officials of the Department
of Defense who face serious and credible threats arising from du-
ties performed while employed by the Department of Defense. The
provision would also require the Secretary to provide written notifi-
cation to former senior officials at least 90 days before terminating
or denying the renewal of physical protection and personal security
or reimbursement for such individuals.
Sec. 1035—Notification of the use of military aircraft for im-
migration enforcement operations
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense, within 7 days of providing military aircraft

the destination country of the aircraft, reassignment of Department
of Defense personnel to support alien detention operations, and any
facility maintenance or upgrades to support such operations.

Sec. 1036—Modification of requirements relating to support
of civil authorities by Armed Forces
The committee recommends a provision that would amend Sec-
tion 723 of title 10, United States Code, to require members of the
Armed Forces, including the National Guard, to visibly display the
name of the armed force, Federal entity, or other organization by
which such individual is employed when supporting civilian law en-
forcement agencies.
Sec. 1037—Prohibition on operation of connected vehicles
designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by per-
sons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdic-
tion of a foreign entity of concern on Department of De-
fense property
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
operation of connected vehicles designed, developed, manufactured,
or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the
jurisdiction of a foreign entity of concern on Department of Defense
property after January 1, 2028. The Secretary of Defense must es-
tablish and publish a list of prohibited connected vehicles by Janu-
ary 1, 2027, and provide a briefing to the congressional defense
committees on an implementation plan by June 1, 2027.
Subtitle E—Studies and Reports
Sec. 1041—Annual report on contract cancellations
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on any cancelled
contracts for the preceding fiscal year, for each of the fiscal years
2027 through 2031, to the congressional defense committees, not
later than 10 days after the President’s budget submission. In the
first report required to be submitted under this provision, the Sec-
retary of Defense should also include reporting on any cancellations
of contracts during fiscal year 2025.
The committee notes the Department of Defense’s efforts to im-
plement the President’s ‘‘Department of Government Efficiency’’
cost efficiency initiative, as directed by Executive Orders 14158 and

Section 19:
14222. The committee commends the Department for its efforts to
find efficiencies through reviews of existing contracts, but notes
that cancelled contracts should be codified through reprogramming
requests or rescission packages that are approved by the Congress.
Furthermore, the committee is disappointed in the lack of detail
provided to date by the Department on the total amount of savings
announced, which does not include any specifics by contract item
line number and are, therefore, unverifiable.
Sec. 1042—Streamlining of total force reporting require-
ments
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 115a and 129 of title 10, United States Code, to streamline
and realign total force reporting requirements. Specifically, this
provision would repeal subsection (g) of section 115a to eliminate
redundant reporting requirements on military technicians, as this
data is included in annual budget materials provided by the De-

the civilian personnel report required by section 129(c) of title 10,
United States Code, into the Defense Manpower Profile Report re-
quired by section 115a of title 10, United States Code, to better
align with the annual President’s budget request and to eliminate
duplicative reporting.
Sec. 1043—Report on National Guard sexual assault preven-
tion and response training
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Chief of the National Guard Bureau, in coordination with the Sec-
retary of Defense, to submit a report to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the
number of National Guard members who have received sexual as-
sault prevention and response training in the preceding calendar
year.
Sec. 1044—Reports to Congress on Department of Defense
support for immigration enforcement operations
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on
the Department of Defense’s support to the Department of Home-
land Security’s (DHS) immigration enforcement operations, not
later than 30 calendar days after the Secretary approves a Request
for Assistance from DHS and every 30 calendar days thereafter.
Sec. 1045—Military Sealift Command
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to submit annual reports to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
commencing not later than 180 days after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, on efforts to improve recruitment and retention
of Military Sealift Command mariners.
Sec. 1046—Report on aliens held at installations of Depart-
ment of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to submit to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report con-
taining the number of aliens held at Department of Defense (DOD)
installations and the total cost of detention of aliens at DOD instal-
lations, not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of
this Act and monthly thereafter.
Sec. 1047—Briefing on expenditures or planned expendi-
tures of funds allocated for exploration and develop-
ment of existing Arctic infrastructure
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the combatant com-
mander for IndoPacific Command and Northern Command, to pro-
vide a briefing every 90 days to the congressional defense commit-
tees on a spending plan for Arctic infrastructure. The committee
recognizes the geostrategic importance of the Arctic to both the

United States and its adversaries, China and Russia. The com-
mittee supports the Department’s strategic efforts in the Arctic re-
gion in to include Alaska, Greenland, and Iceland.
Subtitle F—Other Matters
Sec. 1051—Modification of limitation on assistance in sup-
port of Department of Defense accounting for missing
United States Government personnel
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 408(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code, to increase the max-
imum amount of assistance to foreign nations authorized by section
408 to $15,000,000 per fiscal year.
Sec. 1052—Extension of admission to Guam or the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for certain H–
2B nonimmigrants
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 6(b)(1)(B) of the Joint Resolution titled ‘‘A Joint Resolution to
approve the ’Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of
America’, and for other purposes’’ (48 U.S.C. 1806(b)(1)(B)), ap-
proved March 24, 1976, by extending the deadline for certain non-
immigrant H–2B workers to 2031.
The committee notes that this provision would support the re-
alignment of U.S. forces to Guam by addressing limited workforce
availability on Guam. The committee understands that current
labor market conditions are constrained by recovery from Typhoon
Mawar and that, without this provision, construction costs for the
Department of Defense will increase due to labor shortages as well
as degraded readiness, since construction would also be delayed.
Finally, the committee understands that lead times are crucial to
planning and cost estimates for contractors. Should an additional
extension be necessary, the committee strongly encourages the De-
partment of Defense to begin engagements with the Congress, spe-
cifically the committees of jurisdiction, not less than 3 years before
the authority expires.
Sec. 1053—Prohibiting Secretary of Defense from developing
voting technology or methodology
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of Defense from developing or facilitating any voting
technology or methodology for voting in Federal and state elections.
The committee notes that the Department of Defense (DOD) Fed-
eral Voting Assistance Program has been highly successful in car-
rying out its mission to ensure that all servicemembers are pro-
vided the opportunity to vote in their respective state and local
elections, regardless of where servicemembers are stationed or de-
ployed. The committee notes that the DOD has successfully facili-
tated servicemember overseas voting using all voting methodologies
approved by states and localities and that this success has been
built upon the DOD taking a neutral position with respect to voting
methodology. The committee is concerned that any action taken by
the DOD that endorses, or results in the appearance of endorsing,

any voting methodology over another could undermine the success
of this vital mission. Furthermore, the committee notes that re-
searching and developing technology that supports one type of vot-
ing methodology over another is not a DOD mission.
Sec. 1054—Assessment of the feasibility and advisability of
using personnel of the Department of Defense to sup-
port U.S. Customs and Border Protection
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Home-
land Security, to submit a report to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the
Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee of the Sen-
ate, and the Homeland Security Committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives, within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this
Act, assessing the advisability, feasibility, and cost of using quali-
fied Department of Defense personnel in support of U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, to provide translation and interpretation
services in connection with border security operations.
Sec. 1055—Limitation on availability of funds for travel ex-
penses of the Office of the Secretary of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of 25 percent of the funding authorized
or otherwise made available for the travel expenses of the Office
of the Secretary of Defense until various overdue reports and other
documents are submitted to the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1056—Department of Defense sensitive activities
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to keep the congressional defense committees
fully and currently informed of Department of Defense sensitive ac-
tivities. The provision would also require the Secretary to provide
a notification to the congressional defense committees not later
than 48 hours after the compromise or failure of a Department of
Defense sensitive activity and establish a process for coordinating
and deconflicting contracts that support or enable sensitive activi-
ties with other departments and agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment, as appropriate.
Sec. 1057—Irregular Warfare Exercise Laboratory
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to establish and maintain an Irregular War-
fare Exercise Laboratory. The laboratory would support the train-
ing, experimentation, preparation, and validation of the Armed
Forces of the United States to conduct full-spectrum irregular war-
fare activities, and it would enable activities to build the capacity
and interoperability of the security forces of friendly foreign coun-
tries.
The committee recognizes the importance of training with part-
ner nations to develop the interoperability of irregular and uncon-
ventional warfare tactics, techniques, and procedures in the face of
an increasingly complex global security environment. The com-
mittee notes that the Ridge Runner irregular warfare exercise

Operations Forces, allies and partners, and other stakeholders to
provide validation for deploying special operations elements in dy-
namic and realistic irregular warfare scenarios. The committee en-
courages the expansion of such activities, as appropriate.
Sec. 1058—Semiannual report on Department of Defense op-
erations at the southern land border
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Commander, U.S. Northern Command to provide a report to the
congressional defense committees, not later than 180 days after the
date of the enactment of this Act, and semiannually thereafter, on
the Department of Defense’s efforts at the southwest border.
Sec. 1059—University-based secure innovation incubator
program of Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a program to develop, operate,
and maintain incubator programs for secure facilities and networks
at select universities across the United States.
Sec. 1060—Priority consideration of energy projects that are
likely to experience significant temporal impact due to
seasonal Arctic climate conditions
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to
prioritize, to the maximum extent possible, for purposes of consid-
eration by the Manufacturing Capability Expansion and Invest-
ment Prioritization office, the clearance of mining and energy
project applications and white papers for projects where the oper-
ation or completion of which is likely to experience significant tem-
poral impact due to seasonal Arctic climate conditions.
Sec. 1061—Non-reimbursable support for Afghanistan War
Commission
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1094(f)(2) of the Afghanistan War Commission Act of 2021
(Public Law 117–81) to make modifications relating to non-reim-
bursable support for the Commission.
Sec. 1062—Contracting authority for Afghanistan War Com-
mission
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1094(g) of the Afghanistan War Commission Act of 2021 (Pub-
lic Law 117–81) to authorize the Co-Chairpersons of the Commis-
sion to enter into contracts to enable the Commission to discharge

vironmental services for intelligence community
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Air Force to provide meteorological and environ-
mental services to the intelligence community.
Sec. 1065—Expansion of Individual Longitudinal Exposure
Record
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to expand the Individual Longitudinal Expo-
sure Record (ILER) to document all exposures of servicemembers to
environmental hazards and to make the ILER available to the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs when servicemembers separate or retire
from military service. The provision would also require the Sec-
retary to document in a servicemember’s personnel records whether
the servicemember served at a location where there was a potential
of toxic exposure.
Sec. 1066—Classification of Nevada Test and Training Range
as location where contamination occurred and members
of the Armed Forces were exposed to toxic substances
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to classify the Nevada Test and Training
Range as a location where contamination occurred.
Subtitle G—Defense Workforce Integration
Sec. 1081—Integration of military and civilian hiring proc-
esses
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a pathway for medically disquali-
fied entry-level servicemembers to be hired into civilian positions
for which they are qualified within the Department of Defense and
its components.
Sec. 1082—Provision of information on career opportunities
in the defense industrial base to persons ineligible for
military service
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 50 of title 10, United States Code, to require the Secretary of
Defense to create a program to provide individuals who are not
medically qualified for military service employment opportunities
in support of the national interests of the United States.
Sec. 1083—Provision to Navy personnel of information on

Secretary of the Navy to provide to Navy personnel information
about career opportunities at Military Sealift Command and work-
force training programs for shipbuilders.

Items of Special Interest
Adopting and scaling commercially available extra-large un-
manned underwater vehicles
The committee remains supportive of the Navy’s efforts to inte-
grate large diameter and extra-large unmanned underwater vehi-
cles (UUVs) capable of executing high-value missions in contested
environments. Section 1032 of the Servicemember Quality of Life
Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) requires the Navy, in coordination
with the Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and in consulta-
tion with the Director of the Defense Innovation Unit, to carry out
a competitive demonstration of large and extra-large UUVs
leveraging commercial solutions. The demonstration builds on the
open competition directed by section 862 of the James M. Inhofe
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public
Law 117–263) and held by the Navy and the Defense Innovation
Unit in late 2023. This demonstration culminated in the signing of
three prototype agreements just months later, in early 2024. The
committee is pleased to note that the first large diameter UUV was
delivered to a Navy operational unit for experimentation in late
2024 as a result of the 2023 competition.
The committee is encouraged by the rapid delivery of these capa-
bilities from prototype award to unit experimentation in only 2
years. Therefore, the committee encourages the Secretary of the
Navy to continue leveraging commercial solutions to deliver large
diameter and extra-large UUVs with accompanying support equip-
ment, joint Command and Control software, and sustainment and
support services. The committee recognizes the complementary na-
ture of extra-large UUVs for the submarine industrial base to pro-
vide additional capacity and lethality. The committee also believes
that these vehicles should be capable of integrating a broad array
of payloads and sensors and should be delivered quickly to oper-
ational commands for fleet integration and interoperability develop-
ment, fielding, and operations. Further, the committee believes
that the Secretary of the Navy should expedite fielding of capabili-
ties selected during the 2025 competition to deliver mission-capable
extra-large UUVs for operational testing, user training, and fleet
integration.
Briefing on commercial technology for shipbuilding
The committee acknowledges the importance of the Navy’s ship-
building goals and recognizes shipyards as a critical national secu-
rity asset. The committee is also aware of the need to improve the
output and drive down costs associated with Navy shipbuilding.
The committee notes that in testimony on March 11, 2025, the Act-
ing Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development,

and Acquisition, stated that, for shipbuilding programs, ‘‘On bal-
ance, cost and schedule performance remain poor; deliveries are ap-
proximately 1 to 4 years late, and costs continue to rise faster than
overall inflation.’’
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2026, on the
Navy’s plans to utilize commercially available software to help re-
duce the current shipbuilding backlog.
Briefing on DOD Record Management
The committee affirms its support for the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) report titled ‘‘DOD Law of War Policies: Ac-
tions Needed to Ensure Proper Reporting and Retention of Alleged
Violations’’ (GAO–24–107217), published February 13, 2024. This
report recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) de-
velop and maintain a system to comprehensively retain records of
alleged law of war violations.
Accordingly the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than May 1, 2026, on the status of this recommendation, in-
cluding: (1) A designated lead agency or office within the DOD; and
(2) A plan to ensure that regulations regarding reporting on such
issues remain current and appropriately disseminated within the
DOD.
DDG–51 shipbuilding
The committee supports the Department of the Navy’s efforts to
maintain a robust and capable surface fleet through the DDG–51
Arleigh Burke-class destroyer program, a cornerstone of naval
power. The committee commends the Navy’s progress in sustaining
the industrial base and encourages continued investment to ensure
long-term stability for shipbuilders and suppliers.
However, the committee notes with concern that the Department
of the Navy did not submit the required 30-year shipbuilding plan
with its fiscal year 2026 budget materials, as required by section
231 of title 10, United States Code. This plan is essential for pro-
viding Congress and industry stakeholders with a clear, long-term
vision for naval shipbuilding requirements. The committee urges
the Department of the Navy to promptly fulfill this statutory re-
quirement to enhance transparency and support effective planning.
The committee recognizes congressional intent in the budget rec-
onciliation package, H.R. 1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act), to add a
third destroyer in fiscal year 2027 and fiscal year 2029. This ap-
proach aims to provide a consistent demand signal to the ship-
building industrial base, which has relied on Congress to fund a
third destroyer every other year to maintain a healthy production
backlog. The committee is concerned that the Department of the
Navy’s decision to allocate these funds to subsidize the two fiscal
year 2026 ships, rather than planning for the additional destroyers,
introduces uncertainty for shipbuilders and risks destabilizing the
industrial base. The committee strongly encourages the Depart-
ment of the Navy to prioritize predictable, sustained funding for
the DDG–51 program in its base budget requests, ensuring sta-

bility for the industrial base without dependence on congressional
interventions.
Department of Defense sites for purposes of national secu-
rity reviews
The committee remains concerned that foreign nations, including
the People’s Republic of China, have sought to purchase land near
military installations that have not yet been listed on Appendix A
to 31 Code of Federal Regulations Part 802. As a result of this, the
committee believes that some military installations may not have
been appropriately reviewed for national security concerns.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than Feb-
ruary 1, 2026, regarding which military installations, training
routes, military airspaces, controlled firing areas, and military op-
erations areas he or she deems appropriate for review because of
national security concerns.
Dissemination of civilian legal services (549C) review
The committee finds the Department of Defense (DOD) is incon-
sistently implementing section 549C of the James M. Inhofe Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law
117–263) and the requirement to distribute information on legal
rights to victims of military-connected sexual assault. A review of
how each service is implementing this requirement is necessary to
best protect the victims of military-connected sexual assault and
ensure that section 549C is properly implemented.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Personnel and Readiness, in consultation with the DOD Sexual
Assault Prevention and Response Office, to submit a briefing on
implementation of section 549C to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
March 1, 2026. The briefing should include: (1) An analysis of how
each service is implementing the requirements of 549C, including
any forms that are provided to victims to make them aware of their
rights; (2) Justification for the Department’s reliance on veterans’
services instead of victims’ services, and the viability of providing
victim-centric services; (3) The extent to which the implementation
of the requirements of 549C can be improved and enhanced, to in-
clude consideration of a Department-hosted website; and (4) The vi-
ability and appropriateness of developing uniform standards and
procedures across all the military services for implementing 549C,
including information directly in forms made available to victims or
scripts provided to Military Criminal Investigative Organizations
for agents to read to victims.
Economic considerations in tabletop exercises
The committee believes that the private sector and other depart-
ments and agencies of the Federal Government will play a critical
role in any future conflict, especially involving the People’s Repub-
lic of China. The committee believes these non-Department of De-
fense stakeholders are uniquely positioned to provide insight about
how various contingencies may impact the global and U.S. econo-

mies and how the economic elements of national power may con-
tribute to success in such contingencies.
Therefore, the committee believes that the Secretary of Defense
should invite representatives from U.S. departments and agencies
focused on economic issues, including but not limited to the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, the Department of Commerce, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representa-
tive, the National Economic Council, as well as the private sector
as appropriate, to participate in unclassified Department of De-
fense tabletop exercises for the purposes of: (1) Assessing the eco-
nomic impacts of Department of Defense decisions during crisis and
conflict; and (2) Evaluating the economic tools available to the U.S.
Government to augment Department of Defense capabilities in
competition, crisis, and conflict.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than December 31, 2025, to provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees on the Department’s current and
planned efforts to include representatives from U.S. departments
and agencies focused on economic issues and the private sector in
unclassified Department of Defense tabletop exercises.
The committee notes that the Economic Defense Unit, estab-
lished elsewhere in this Act, should contribute to these efforts.
Government Accountability Office review of costs of sup-
porting civil authorities
The committee notes that since 2002, the Department of Defense
(DOD) has supported the Department of Homeland Security’s
(DHS) requests to secure the Nation’s borders. Over the years, the
DOD has seen an increase in requirements for supporting civil au-
thorities including the deployment of additional active-duty mili-
tary personnel and other assets to the United States-Mexico bor-
der. Published on February 23, 2021, the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) produced a report entitled ‘‘Southwest Border
Security: Actions Are Needed to Address the Cost and Readiness
Implications of Continued DOD Support to U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection’’ (GAO–21–356), which found weaknesses in the
DOD’s estimates of the costs to support DHS activities. Further,
GAO found that the DOD did not track all costs or give Congress
timely information on the full costs the DOD incurred for DHS sup-
port, as it was mandated to do. The committee is interested in en-
suring that it has an accurate assessment of DOD and National
Guard support of operations to the DHS and therefore directs the
Comptroller General of the United States to assess the extent to
which the DOD has tracked the costs, including reimbursement
and reprogramming actions, for its support to the DHS since fiscal
year 2025 and the extent to which the DOD is following statutory
reporting requirements for support to the DHS since fiscal year

Section 20:
2025.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to brief the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, with the results of the review to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.

Increased access to ocean data
The committee notes that improved access to Navy data that no
longer needs to be classified could have wide and far-reaching im-
pacts across ocean interests, including for research related to the
physical and biological properties of the ocean, ocean health, fish-
eries, and ocean exploration.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Secretary of the
Navy, as part of broader Navy efforts to standardize and make
available oceanographic data, to take the steps necessary to ensure
the release of, and public access to, unclassified and declassified
oceanographic data, subject to existing regulatory restrictions.
Irregular warfare
The committee believes irregular warfare is a critical component
of the Department of Defense’s ability to effectively deter and
counter threats across the continuum of competition and conflict.
The committee notes that, in recent years, the Department has re-
leased multiple strategic-level documents, including the 2018 Irreg-
ular Warfare Annex to the National Defense Strategy and the Joint
Concept for Competing, in an attempt to bring greater clarity and
cohesion to its irregular warfare and other asymmetric activities.
Yet, the committee is concerned that the Department’s approach to
institutionalizing irregular warfare as a core component of its plan-
ning and steady-state activities around the world has been ad-hoc
and inhibited by institutional and bureaucratic impediments.
The committee notes that section 1091 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) af-
firmed that the Secretary of Defense has the authority to conduct
irregular warfare operations, including clandestine irregular war-
fare operations, to defend the United States, allies of the United
States, and interests of the United States. The committee believes
the Secretary’s authority includes the conduct of steady-state irreg-
ular warfare military operations short of hostilities in areas outside
of areas of active hostilities, including, but not limited to, oper-
ational preparation of the environment, information operations,
cyber operations, civil-military operations, and building partner ca-
pacity.
The committee directs the Secretary to provide a briefing to the
Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than December 31,
2025, on the Department’s ongoing and planned efforts to institu-
tionalize irregular warfare within the Department. The briefing
should, at a minimum, include the following: (1) A detailed descrip-
tion of the Department’s overarching campaign plan for irregular
warfare operations within and across geographic combatant com-
mand areas of responsibility; (2) A description of the roles and re-
sponsibilities for the planning, resourcing, and conduct of irregular
warfare in the Department; (3) An overview of existing execute or-
ders relevant to the conduct of irregular warfare activities around
the world; and (4) Any other matters deemed relevant by the Sec-
retary.

fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283),
the Department of Defense (DOD) established the Irregular War-
fare Center to serve as the DOD’s Center of Excellence for Irreg-
ular Warfare. The Irregular Warfare Center is responsible for de-
veloping and disseminating irregular warfare knowledge across the
defense enterprise and international community, with particular
emphasis on countering the Chinese Communist Party’s malign ac-
tivities around the world. The committee further notes that the Ir-
regular Warfare Center is partnering with a consortium of institu-
tions of higher education to provide academic research to support
the Center’s efforts relating to irregular warfare.
The committee notes the critical importance of irregular warfare
to the Department’s efforts to create dilemmas, impose costs, and
counter the malign activities of adversaries around the world, par-
ticularly the Chinese Communist Party. The committee further be-
lieves that a dedicated entity within the Department focused on ir-
regular warfare provides military commanders, policy makers, and
foreign partners with valuable insight and support. The committee
encourages the Department to continue efforts to mature the Irreg-
ular Warfare Center and integrate its work into policy-making, pro-
fessional military education, and engagement with foreign partners
and allies.
Large surface combatant briefing
The Navy’s DDG(X) program aims to procure a new class of guid-
ed-missile destroyers to replace the Ticonderoga (CG–47)-class
Aegis cruisers and older Arleigh Burke (DDG–51)-class Aegis de-
stroyers. The Navy plans to procure the first DDG(X) in 2032, with
introduction to the fleet prior to 2040. The DDG(X) class of destroy-
ers is designed to serve through the 2060s.
Given the program’s complexity, the need to avoid past ship-
building errors, and the importance of a robust industrial base, the
committee has taken the following legislative steps to support the
Navy’s efforts:
(1) Section 131 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92) directed the Navy to
conduct a robust land-based testing program to prove out items
designated as critical risks and also the complete propulsion
system in a prototype form, prior to milestone B;
(2) Section 221 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) directed a continued, ro-
bust, and land-based testing program prior to ship delivery to
fully test the propulsion plant in its final form, replicating the
final ship configuration;
(3) Section 130 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) af-
firmed the need for a close collaborative partnership with the
large surface combatant shipyards and the Navy during design
and development of DDG(X); and
(4) Section 820 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) made changes to
multiyear procurement authorities in title 10 to ensure the De-
partment of Defense accounts for the industrial base when
making procurement decisions.

The committee encourages the Department to make timely de-
sign decisions to move forward with the program with a firm set
of requirements that balance warfighter needs and shipbuilder fea-
sibility. To ensure progress, the committee directs the Secretary of
the Navy to provide a briefing on the DDG(X) program to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than January 30, 2026.
The briefing shall include:
(1) The current status of warfighting and technical design re-
quirements;
(2) The plan to ensure sufficient design margin, including
size, weight, power, and cooling (SWAP–C) requirements, for
the program’s 30-year lifespan;
(3) The status of partnerships with large surface combatant
prime contractors, including specific actions to achieve design
improvements and cost savings;
(4) The impacts of accelerating the award of the detail design
and construction contract in fiscal year 2030; and
(5) Any additional relevant information the Secretary finds
pertinent.
Maritime industrial base supplier funding
The committee encourages additional opportunities for capability
expansion within the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB) supply chain
and notes that second- and third-tier submarine industrial base
suppliers are challenged by several factors, including workforce
availability and training, material costs, and production schedule
inconsistencies. The committee further notes that the Supplier De-
velopment Funding program has demonstrated positive results by
increasing production capacity and providing investment for ma-
chinery and equipment within the MIB. The committee is con-
cerned, however, that second- and third-tier suppliers remain chal-
lenged by current economic conditions as they struggle to meet the
build schedule for Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than January 1, 2026, on opportunities for: (1) A capital loan
authority for MIB suppliers; and (2) Private-sector financing op-
tions, including such authorities proposed elsewhere in this bill.
Medium unmanned surface vessel program requirements
and acquisition
The committee strongly supports the Department of the Navy’s
efforts to transition to a hybrid fleet integrating unmanned systems
to enhance operational flexibility and resilience. The committee
commends the Navy’s decision to defer the Large Unmanned Sur-
face Vessel program, with its complex requirements, in favor of
prioritizing the near-term scaling of the Medium Unmanned Sur-
face Vessel (MUSV) program to address urgent operational needs,
including those articulated by the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
However, the committee is concerned that the current MUSV ap-
proach, redesignated as the Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC)
program and centered on converting seven commercial Offshore
Support Vessels for delivery by 2027, does not fully align with the
Navy’s long-term strategic objectives. The committee believes that

the MASC program, as structured, may fail to meet critical mission
profiles, requires significant manning and sustainment resources,
and will not yield a scalable design representative of a future
MUSV program of record. This approach risks delaying critical
learning opportunities and hindering the Navy’s ability to field
operationally relevant unmanned systems at scale.
The committee recognizes that multiple industry partners are de-
veloping mature, purpose-built MUSV solutions that leverage ad-
vanced commercial technologies, offering significant advantages in
performance, autonomy, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To cap-
italize on these advancements, the committee strongly recommends
that the Navy revise the MUSV program requirements and adopt
an open, competitive solicitation process, such as a Commercial So-
lutions Opening, in coordination with the Director of the Defense
Innovation Unit. This approach should prioritize near-term, scal-
able solutions that maximize the use of privately financed, commer-
cially derived technologies to accelerate development and deploy-
ment while fostering robust competition.
To ensure alignment with these objectives, the committee directs
the Secretary of the Navy, in coordination with the Commander,
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, to provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than November 1, 2025. The
briefing shall include, at a minimum, the following elements: (1)
An explanation of the updated operational and technical require-
ments for the MUSV program, emphasizing scalability and align-
ment with validated operational needs articulated by the Com-
mander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command; (2) An outline of the Navy’s
acquisition strategy, including the use of an open solicitation proc-
ess to maximize competition and incorporate commercially derived
and privately developed technologies; (3) A plan for rapid proto-
typing, including timelines, milestones, and metrics for evaluating
prototype performance, with a focus on iterative development to ac-
celerate learning and refine designs for scalability; (4) A strategy
for transitioning successful prototypes to a program of record, in-
cluding projected timelines, cost estimates, and plans for integra-
tion into the Navy’s hybrid fleet architecture; and (5) An analysis
of risks associated with the current MASC approach compared to
a purpose-built MUSV solution, including sustainment, manning,
and operational effectiveness considerations.
The committee urges the Navy to prioritize innovative, commer-
cially driven solutions to deliver a scalable MUSV capability that
meets the urgent needs of the fleet while fostering a competitive
industrial base. This approach will ensure the Navy achieves oper-
ational advantages in contested environments and maintains tech-
nological superiority.
Narrative intelligence and cognitive warfare
The committee recognizes that the rapidly evolving global secu-
rity landscape and the increasing sophistication of information-cen-
tric threats pose significant strategic challenges, particularly as
peer and near-peer competitors increasingly prioritize efforts and
investments in this domain of warfare. The committee notes that
the People’s Republic of China, for example, is actively engaged in
developing what it terms ‘‘informatized warfare’’ and

‘‘intelligentized warfare,’’ with a strong emphasis on cognitive do-
main operations, involving the integration of information warfare
across military and civilian sectors and viewing information as a
critical domain for achieving strategic advantage in great power
competition. The committee believes there is an urgent need for a
coherent understanding of and investment in cognitive warfare to
address these challenges.
The committee notes that despite multiple congressional actions,
there remain ambiguities and challenges in core definitions relat-
ing to information warfare, with frequent conflation of terms such
as information warfare, information operations, cyberwarfare, cog-
nitive warfare, and influence operations. The committee believes
this definitional ambiguity contributes to a lack of strategic clarity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a report on cognitive warfare and narrative intelligence to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026. In this report, the
Secretary of Defense shall define cognitive warfare as it relates to
the Department of Defense and assess how this definition aligns
with or relates to existing doctrinal elements, including information
warfare, psychological operations, and military information support
operations. Additionally, the committee directs the report to in-
clude an assessment of which Department of Defense organizations
contribute to and have functional responsibility for cognitive war-
fare efforts. Finally, the report must include an examination of the
relative value of narrative intelligence, defined as intelligence of
the story or narrative an adversary is attempting to build, to cog-
nitive warfare and related disciplines. The committee expects this
evaluation to consider how narrative intelligence can enhance mili-
tary operations, including information operations and irregular
warfare.
Navy water purification system upgrades
The committee notes that the Navy has been using hazardous
bromine cartridges in smaller surface combatants as the means of
purifying non-potable water, despite the fact that safer, non-haz-
ardous alternatives, such as Mixed-Oxidant Electrolytic Disinfect-
ant Generator equipment, have been successfully deployed on
large-deck ship classes for nearly two decades. Despite this proven
track record, the transition to such technologies on smaller ships
has been stalled.
The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit to the
congressional defense committees a report, not later than March
30, 2026, on the removal of hazardous bromine cartridges currently
used in surface combatants as the means of potable water purifi-
cation. The report should include an explanation and assessment
of: (1) The use of the non-hazardous water purification tech-
nologies; and (2) The timeline for broader implementation of such
technologies as previously directed and funded by the Congress.

Navy continue to report near record rates of serious Class A flight
mishaps. Congress created the Joint Safety Council in the National

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–
81), upon the recommendation of the National Commission on Mili-
tary Aviation Safety, to focus on operational safety challenges, as
well as to augment existing safety programs.
The committee also supports the use of both Accident Investiga-
tion Boards and Safety Investigation Boards to identify root causes
of accidents and recommendations for corrective actions to prevent
future accidents, including improved training, maintenance, and
oversight. In order to ensure the key findings and recommenda-
tions of these investigations are addressed and implemented, the
committee directs the Joint Safety Council, in coordination with the
military services, to provide a report to the Senate Armed Services
Committee, not later than April 1, 2026, that contains executive
summaries for Safety Investigation Boards conducted from January
1, 2022, to July 1, 2025, and summaries of any corrective actions
implemented in response to the Board’s findings.
Shipbuilding industrial base cost estimate
The committee recognizes the critical importance of having a ro-
bust shipbuilding industrial base to achieve the Department of the
Navy’s battle force ship inventory goals. In the Senate report ac-
companying S. 4638 (S. Rpt. 118–188) of the Servicemember Qual-
ity of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159), the committee directed
the Secretary of the Navy, in consultation with the Director of Cost
Assessment and Program Evaluation, to deliver an unconstrained
cost estimate of industrial base investments necessary to meet the
inventory plan for conventional surface ships. The committee reit-
erates its directive for the Navy to deliver this report to the con-
gressional defense committees.
The committee emphasizes specific elements of the report to ad-
dress pressing priorities. First, the report should provide a detailed
assessment of strategic outsourcing opportunities for ship modules,
such as steel fabrication, machining, and outfitting workload, to
manufacturers across the nation. This is critical to addressing
workforce shortages in major shipbuilding regions and to enhanc-
ing distributive shipbuilding as a core component of program de-
sign, rather than as a corrective measure to deal with shipbuilding
programs after they develop cost and schedule problems. The sec-
ond element concerns infrastructure investments. The report
should prioritize infrastructure improvements at major shipyards,
including Bath Iron Works, Ingalls Shipbuilding, General Dynam-
ics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, Fincantieri
Marinette Marine, and Austal USA. These improvements should
encompass facilities, equipment, quality of life, and other capital
expenditures to bolster capacity and ensure timely production of
surface combatants and other naval vessels.
Additionally, the committee is interested in evaluating the feasi-
bility of investing in new ship construction or repair yards, includ-
ing those capable of supporting nuclear naval shipbuilding. The
committee understands that the Navy, in collaboration with the Di-
rector of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, is conducting
a study on the potential for such facilities.

Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
brief the congressional defense committees on the findings of this
study, not later than September 1, 2025, including providing an as-
sessment of whether such investments are advisable to meet future
force structure goals.
Software colors of money
The committee remains interested in ensuring that the Depart-
ment of Defense is postured to procure and operate software pro-
grams in the most effective and efficient manner possible. The com-
mittee notes that the Commission on Planning, Programming,
Budgeting, and Execution Reform recommended, in its March 2024
final report, that the Department revise the Financial Management
Regulation related to funding for software refreshes or upgrades.
The committee is also aware of ongoing efforts in the Budget Activ-
ity 8 initiative.
Therefore, not later than January 1, 2026, the Under Secretary
of Defense (Comptroller) shall submit a report to the congressional
defense committees detailing proposed changes to the Department’s
Financial Management Regulation that would be needed to imple-
ment the Commission’s recommendation #11A to allow procure-
ment; research, development, test, and evaluation; or operation and
maintenance funds to be used for the full cycle of software develop-
ment, prototyping, testing, fielding, revision, and sustainment,
while ensuring full oversight over the totality of software spending
by activity type.
Special operations forces promotions, assignments, and re-
tention
The committee notes that section 167(e)(2)(J) of title 10, United
States Code, states that the Commander, U.S. Special Operations
Command (SOCOM), is responsible for monitoring the promotions
of special operations forces (SOF) and coordinating with the mili-
tary departments on matters related to SOF assignments, reten-
tion, training, professional military education, and special and in-
centive pays. The committee also notes that section 907 of the
Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) re-
quires the Secretary of Defense to establish a process for the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Inten-
sity Conflict to monitor the promotions of members of special oper-
ations forces and to coordinate with the military departments re-
garding the assignment, retention, training, professional military
education, and special and incentive pays of members of special op-
erations forces consistent with the ‘‘service secretary-like’’ respon-
sibilities assigned to the Assistant Secretary.
The committee is concerned about the extent to which the Assist-
ant Secretary and the Commander, SOCOM are exercising their
authority to monitor the promotion opportunities for SOF to meet
staffing requirements and coordinating with the military depart-
ments on the assignment of leaders to special operations, service,
and joint positions. Therefore, the committee directs the Comp-
troller General of the United States to review SOF promotions, as-
signments, and retention by assessing: (1) To what extent the As-

sistant Secretary and the Commander, SOCOM monitor SOF pro-
motions; (2) To what extent the Assistant Secretary and the Com-
mander, SOCOM coordinate with the military departments on SOF
assignments, retention, training, professional military education,
and special and incentive pays; (3) The extent to which the DOD
has processes for assigning SOF officer and enlisted personnel to
key leadership positions within the SOF service components and
other SOF units, service, and joint positions; (4) To what extent the
Assistant Secretary; the Commander, SOCOM; and the military de-
partments have guidance concerning their respective authorities,
roles, and responsibilities to monitor SOF promotions and coordi-
nate on assignments, retention, training, professional military edu-
cation, and special and incentive pays; and (5) Any other related
matters the Comptroller General considers appropriate.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a preliminary briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than De-
cember 31, 2025, and to provide the final results of the review to
these committees on a mutually agreed upon date.
Status of the Department of Defense financial audit
The committee remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving
a clean financial audit opinion for the Department of Defense
(DOD), as mandated by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990
and subsequent legislation. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, the
DOD continues to make incremental progress, with 10 of 28 major
reporting entities receiving unmodified or qualified audit opinions.
However, significant challenges persist, including serious financial
management problems, the inability to adequately account for
intragovernmental activity and balances between Federal entities,
and weaknesses in the process for preparing consolidated financial
statements. These issues, compounded by inadequate controls over
financial data and outdated financial management systems, con-
tinue to hinder the DOD’s ability to achieve a clean audit opinion,
undermining fiscal transparency and accountability in the steward-
ship of taxpayer resources.

Section 22:
Section 1005 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) establishes a deadline of December
31, 2028, for the DOD to achieve an unmodified audit opinion
across all financial statements. To support this deadline, the com-
mittee directs the Secretary of Defense to deliver a report to the
congressional defense committees, not later than February 1, 2026,
detailing implementation of a plan to address deficiencies and meet
the statutory deadline. This plan shall include the following ele-
ments:
(1) A timeline for consolidating DOD data systems for audit
purposes;
(2) Identify and resolve critical material weaknesses in fi-
nancial reporting, internal controls, and systems integration,
as identified in prior audit findings;
(3) Establish robust processes to fully reconcile intergovern-
mental transactions;

(4) Implement standardized procedures to accurately account
for and value all property, plant, and equipment held by third
parties, including contractors and other entities;
(5) Develop and enforce protocols to ensure compliance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Federal Ac-
counting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) standards, and
other established audit requirements;
(6) Ensure all assets, liabilities, and financial transactions
are accurately accounted for and valued in accordance with
federal standards;
(7) Implement processes to fully document, validate, and
support all open obligations, ensuring transparency and
traceability in financial commitments;
(8) Integrate procure-to-pay processes into all appropriate
general ledgers, ensuring seamless tracking of financial trans-
actions from procurement to payment; and
(9) Leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and automation tech-
nologies to enhance audit readiness.
Study on Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance
Program grant administration and compliance
The committee directs the Comptroller General of the United
States to review activities that the Department of Defense (DOD)
Federal Voting Assistance Program has undertaken to provide as-
sistance to voters and states to facilitate voting for military and
overseas citizens voters. This review should include the DOD’s ef-
forts to administer and oversee grants provided to states and local-
ities under section 6304 of title 31, United States Code, and section
20311 of title 52, United States Code, for the purpose of conducting
one or more pilot programs on new election technology for the ben-
efit of Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act
(UOCAVA) voters. It should also review how the Secretary of De-
fense oversees whether states and localities use those grant funds
in a manner consistent with the grant agreement terms. The re-
view should also include what is known about the use and security
of systems for the electronic delivery, marking, and return of bal-
lots for federal elections for UOCAVA voters.
The committee directs the Comptroller General to provide an in-
terim briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives on this review, not later than
January 12, 2026, with a final product to follow by a date mutually
agreed upon at the time of the briefing.
Study on integration of force management, budgeting, and
requirements processes and combatant commands head-
quarters funding
The committee recognizes the need for greater alignment among
the Department of Defense’s force management, budgeting, and re-
quirements determination processes to enhance efficiency and oper-
ational effectiveness. The committee notes that both the military
services and the combatant commands (COCOMs) face budget con-
straints. The committee also understands that the COCOMs rely
on the military services to develop and acquire capabilities that
allow the COCOMs to execute and sustain their missions.

Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a one-time report to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 1, 2026, on the feasibility, advisability, benefits,
risks, and potential implementation options for ways to improve
the integration of global force management with resourcing and
programming decisions to enhance cost awareness and strategic
prioritization, to include an evaluation of shifting COCOM head-
quarters budgets from the military services to improve financial
transparency and flexibility while ensuring continued host-service
support.
The committee encourages the Secretary to seek input and rec-
ommendations from qualified independent federally funded re-
search and development centers in drafting the required report.
Support for clarifying budget materials for industry con-
sumption
The committee supports the importance of a consistent, clear de-
mand signal regarding defense spending and priorities for the de-
fense industrial base. The committee encourages the Department of
Defense—consistent with recommendations made by the Commis-
sion on Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Reform
in its March 2024 final report—to examine the structure, content,
and format for annual budget justification books and to strive for
some uniformity on these components across services and agencies.
The Department of Defense should consider how to improve its
communication of budget information to traditional, non-tradi-
tional, large, and small defense companies to spur innovation and
participation across the defense industrial base. The committee ac-
knowledges that small startup defense firms in particular are frus-
trated by the lack of clarity and plain language of defense budgets
and programs. The committee encourages the Department of De-
fense to work with Congress to rectify this issue.
Transportation to and from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay
The committee remains concerned about the challenges
servicemembers and their families face when stationed at Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with traveling to and from the in-
stallation. There are limited options for flights, which makes it
challenging for planning purposes, and there are no commercial
flight options. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the
Navy, in coordination with United States Transportation Command
(TRANSCOM), to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, on how the transportation challenges impact servicemembers,
dependent family members, and other patrons with a need for trav-
el to and from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The briefing shall
include, but not be limited to: (1) How existing contracts can be ex-
panded and utilized to include mission specific transportation as
well as morale, welfare, and recreation travel for servicemembers
and their families; (2) Any additional resources required to expand
existing flight options; (3) Any existing challenges or limitations to
expand and offer additional options for servicemembers, families,
and other patrons; and (4) Any other matters the Secretary of the
Navy or TRANSCOM determine to be relevant.

Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security
Charter
The committee continues to believe that the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security (OUSD(I&S))
must be properly organized to fulfill its statutory and policy re-
sponsibilities in order to ensure that the defense intelligence enter-
prise is providing American warfighters with the intelligence they
need to deter, and if necessary, fight and win our nation’s wars.
The committee remains concerned that USD(I&S) governing docu-
mentation, particularly its chartering directive, does not accurately
reflect its roles and responsibilities. The committee urges
USD(I&S) to use the findings of the Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO) report on OUSD(I&S) roles and responsibilities, titled
‘‘Roles and Responsibilities of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Intelligence and Security.’’ That GAO information paper was re-
quired by the committee report (S. Rept. 118–188) accompanying
the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159),
to inform updates to all relevant Department of Defense policy doc-
umentation.
Therefore, the committee directs USD(I&S) to provide a briefing
to the congressional defense committees by April 6, 2026, on its
plan and timeline to update the USD(I&S) chartering directive and
to ensure all chartering directives for the organizations under
USD(I&S) authority, direction, and control are updated in line with
the USD(I&S) chartering directive.
Weather wing cloud modernization
The committee recognizes the 557th Weather Wing’s critical role
in delivering operational weather intelligence to combatant com-
manders, planners, and the Joint Force. Current legacy infrastruc-
ture significantly hinders the timely dissemination of high-fidelity
meteorological and atmospheric data, creating risks to force readi-
ness, mission effectiveness, and operational safety in dynamic and
contested environments. The committee notes that transitioning to
secure cloud-based systems, integrated with artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities, would enable faster
ingestion, automated analysis, and seamless sharing of weather
data from a diverse and growing array of sources. Real-time fore-
casting and predictive analytics would enhance mission planning,
better illuminate the operational environment, support time-sen-
sitive operational decisions, and reduce the impact of weather-re-
lated disruptions across global theaters of operation.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in coordination with the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the
Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, to sub-
mit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than March 1, 2026, that includes: (1) An assessment of operational
limitations imposed by current forecasting, data management, and
cloud infrastructure systems at the 557th Weather Wing; (2) A de-
tailed roadmap for secure, scalable cloud migration of the Wing’s
enterprise infrastructure, including anticipated technical mile-
stones; (3) A comprehensive survey of available commercial and
government-developed AI/ML tools capable of supporting advanced

ments in forecasting accuracy, data dissemination speed, and over-
all mission readiness. The report shall be submitted in unclassified
form but may include a classified annex.

TITLE XI—CIVILIAN PERSONNEL MATTERS
Subtitle A—Personnel Matters
Sec. 1101—Educational travel authority for dependents of
certain employees
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, notwithstanding section 1599b of title 10,
United States Code, to direct the Director of the Defense Travel
Management Office to update the Joint Travel Regulations to au-
thorize educational travel for a dependent of a covered employee
without regard to whether the Federal agency responsible for the
employment of the covered employee anticipates that the covered
employee will be transferred or travel to a location in the United
States for home leave. This authority is limited to Department of
Defense Education Activity (DODEA) employees assigned to Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay.
The committee acknowledges the unique challenges posed by
Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. There are no commercial flight
options to ensure a dependent could return home. Additionally, the
committee understands that the existing flights are quite limited,
and the priority list does not guarantee a seat for a dependent to
return home within the mandated window of time prior to the end
of a DODEA teacher’s school year and subsequent leave.
Sec. 1102—One-year extension of authority to waive annual
limitation on premium pay and aggregate limitation on
pay for Federal civilian employees working overseas
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1101 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110–417), as most recently
amended by section 1104 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend for 1 year the authority of
heads of executive agencies to waive the limitation on the aggre-
gate of basic and premium pay of employees who perform work
supporting certain military or contingency operations.
Sec. 1103—One-year extension of temporary authority to
grant allowances, benefits, and gratuities to civilian per-
sonnel on official duty in a combat zone
The committee recommends a provision that would extend for 1
year the discretionary authority of the head of a Federal agency to
provide allowances, benefits, and gratuities, comparable to those
provided to members of the Foreign Service, to the agency’s civilian
employees on official duty in a combat zone.

Sec. 1104—Modifications to Defense Civilian Training Corps
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2200h of title 10, United States Code, to provide direct hiring
authority for up to 60 graduates of the Defense Civilian Training
Corps every calendar year. The provision would also require the
Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of
the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight and Government Re-
form of the House of Representatives, not later than January 31,
2026, and annually thereafter until January 31, 2030, on the use
of this hiring authority.
Sec. 1105—Modifications to requirements for the President
of the Defense Acquisition University
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1746(e)(3) of title 10, United States Code, to modify require-
ments related to the President of Defense Acquisition University by
striking ‘‘term’’ in both places it appears and inserting ‘‘tenure.’’
Sec. 1106—Modification of direct hire authority for domestic
defense industrial base facilities
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1125 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2017 (Public Law 114–328) to clarify that the direct hire authority
provided by that section includes the Navy Supervisor of Ship-
building, Conversion, and Repair positions. The provision would
also require the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform of the House of Representatives on the
use of this authority.
Sec. 1107—Cyber workforce recruitment and retention
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1599f of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Sec-
retary of Defense to expand the cyber excepted service to include
any position the Secretary considers necessary to carry out the
cyber mission of the Department of Defense. The provision would
also authorize the Secretary to appoint personnel to the cyber ex-
cepted service without regard to any provision in title 5, United
States Code, governing the appointment of employees in the civil
service. Additionally, the provision would authorize the Secretary
to provide basic pay to employees in the cyber excepted service that
is consistent with comparable positions in the Federal Government,
but not to exceed 150 percent of salary paid for positions at Level
I of the Executive Schedule, and additional compensation up to a
maximum amount that is equivalent to the salary of the Vice Presi-
dent of the United States. Finally, the provision would authorize
the Secretary to establish a Defense Digital Executive Service for
positions in the cyber excepted service that are comparable to posi-
tions in the Senior Executive Service.

Finally, the provision would require the Comptroller General of
the United States to review implementation of this section and pro-
vide a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representa-
tives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than 5 years after the date of
the enactment of this Act.
The committee expects the Department to use this expanded au-
thority judiciously, consistent with the pay practices of other agen-
cies for similar positions.
Sec. 1108—Prohibition on use of funds to reduce the work-
force at public shipyards
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit
funds authorized by this Act from being used to reduce the work-
force at public shipyards.
Items of Special Interest
Civilian workforce policy
The committee recognizes that the current locality pay system
under the General Schedule may not adequately account for the
evolving economic and labor conditions that affect federal employ-
ees, particularly those in regions experiencing significant economic
growth and rising costs of living. The existing system may rely on
outdated methodologies that do not fully capture regional cost-of-
living differences or emerging workforce trends.
The committee is concerned that limitations in the current local-
ity pay system have led to recruitment and retention challenges in
critical mission areas, including national security and defense-re-
lated functions. This issue is particularly evident in states like
Utah, where defense installations, such as Hill Air Force Base, play
a vital role in national security. The Salt Lake City, Utah, metro-
politan area and surrounding regions have experienced rapid eco-
nomic growth, rising housing costs, and increased private-sector
competition, yet these factors may not be adequately reflected in
current locality pay adjustments.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in con-
sultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management,
to assess the locality pay system for Department of Defense em-
ployees. This assessment should include: (1) A review of current
methodologies used to determine locality pay adjustments and their
alignment with actual cost of living and labor market data; (2) An
evaluation of regional disparities that impact recruitment and re-
tention of Federal employees in defense-related roles; (3) Consider-
ation of alternative models, including adjustments based on broad-
er economic indicators, private-sector wage comparisons, and re-
gional housing market trends; and (4) Recommendations for legisla-
tive or administrative changes necessary to improve the accuracy,
fairness, and effectiveness of locality pay adjustments.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a re-
port on these findings and recommendations to the Committees on

Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than April 1, 2026.
Scholarship for service hiring
The committee supports the scholarship for service programs of
the Department of Defense (DOD), including the Science, Mathe-
matics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program, the
Defense Civilian Training Corps (DCTC), and the Cyber Service
Academy (CSA), recognizing them as effective recruiting tools for
the Department. In exchange for the Department paying for some
portion of a participant’s post-secondary education, the participant
agrees to work as a civilian employee in the DOD.
The committee notes that the DOD is currently developing guid-
ance to address the placement of this year’s graduating students
from the SMART, DCTC, and CSA programs, enabling them to ful-
fill their service commitments. The committee appreciates the De-
partment’s efforts to ensure these students contribute to DOD mis-
sions, aligning with the significant investment in their education.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than January 31,
2026, on the status of scholarship for service program participants
(including SMART, DCTC, and CSA) who completed their agreed-
upon education from December 1, 2024, through September 31,

Section 23:
2025. The briefing shall include: (1) Whether these students were
hired by the Department as part of their service obligation; (2) If
these students were not hired, an explanation of the status of a
participant’s DOD civilian service obligation; and (3) If a partici-
pant’s service obligation was waived, an assessment of the costs to
the Department to provide the participant students’ education.
Hiring freeze and scholarship programs
The committee recognizes the critical importance of the Depart-
ment of Defense Cyber Service Academy (DOD CSA) scholarship
program, which provides tuition-free education to students in ex-
change for a commitment to serve in DOD or Intelligence Commu-
nity cybersecurity roles. This innovative program, established with
strong congressional support, addresses significant gaps in the na-
tional cybersecurity workforce by developing a pipeline of highly
qualified cyber professionals. The committee also recognizes the im-
portant role that other scholarship programs play, such as the
SMART Defense Scholarship Program and the David Boren Schol-
arship Program, and the benefits the Department receives from
graduates of non-DOD scholarship programs such as the National
Science Foundation CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service program.
The committee is concerned that despite the President’s memo-
randum on the hiring freeze including an exception for positions re-
lated to national security, a hiring freeze remains in place for key
cyber and science and technology roles. The DOD CSA alone in-
vests over $100,000 per student per year. The Department has in-
formed the committee that without a hiring exemption the Depart-
ment’s only course of action is to forgive graduates’ service commit-
ments and forgive any payback. The continued hiring freeze there-

fore risks wasting significant taxpayer money and ensures that key
national security roles remain unfilled.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Secretary of Defense
to press for the authorized exception to the hiring freeze for schol-
arship program graduates and ensure that the exception is in place
before our investments in spring 2025 graduates are lost.

to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity while also in-

existing programs and authorities including the Joint Ukrainian
Multinational Program—Services, Training, and Articles Rapid
Timeline (JUMPSTART) to work with European partners to sup-
port and expedite the delivery of weapons, training, and logistics
to Ukraine. The provision would also require the Secretary of De-
fense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees
describing opportunities to expand the use of the JUMPSTART pro-
gram, a summary of Department efforts to accelerate delivery of
equipment to Ukraine, an analysis of opportunities and advantages
of pooling resources with allies for such efforts, and any regulatory

sider among the factors whether a country has submitted its an-
nual plan to meet, and has made progress toward, the NATO
spending pledge to spend 5 percent of Gross Domestic Product on
defense by 2035.
Subtitle D—Matters Relating to the Indo-Pacific Region
Sec. 1231—Extension of Pacific Deterrence Initiative
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1251 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) to ex-
tend the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) through fiscal year

Section 25:
2026.
The committee reaffirms its support for the PDI as a mechanism
to strengthen U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific and to enhance
transparency into the Department of Defense’s activities that sup-
port deterrence, reassure allies and partners, and build readiness
and operational capability in the region—primarily west of the
International Date Line. However, the committee remains con-
cerned that the Department’s approach to identifying pro-
grammatic investments for PDI lacks consistency, alignment with

strategic priorities, and internal accountability. Additionally, there
is significant variation in how the Office of the Secretary of De-
fense, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the military services, and others
in the Department interpret and apply criteria to select programs
for the PDI budget exhibit—making it difficult for the Congress to
evaluate progress, assess tradeoffs, and identify trends over time.
To improve the transparency and utility of the PDI budget ex-
hibit, the committee directs the Department to annually include op-
eration and maintenance budget estimates for all operational forces
and supporting enablers west of the International Date Line, along
with any enhancements to those forces. While the focus of PDI
should be on enhancements, these cannot be properly evaluated
without visibility of the baseline they are intended to enhance. En-
hancements may include operation and maintenance, procurement,
and military construction programs. In all cases, however, enhance-
ments should be primarily west of the International Date Line or
necessary for missions west of the International Date Line. The
committee further directs the Department to include budget esti-
mates related to deployments or rotations of units west of the
International Date Line. The committee also directs the Depart-
ment to include routine costs west of the International Date Line
if they are directly supporting a PDI category and selected consist-
ently across the Department’s components; for example, such costs
could include facilities sustainment restoration and modernization.
The committee notes that this direction is intended to supplement,
not replace, existing statutory requirements for the PDI budget ex-
hibit.
As noted in the committee report accompanying S. 4638 (S. Rept.
118–188), the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025, as passed by
the Senate, the committee believes the PDI could be used more ef-
fectively to incentivize additional investments by the military serv-
ices in joint enabling capabilities needed in the Indo-Pacific the-
ater. The committee continues to urge the Department to utilize a
total obligation authority withhold technique for a significant por-
tion of the PDI. The committee notes that the Department still has
not complied with the requirement expressed in last year’s com-
mittee report to provide the congressional defense committees with
a plan for utilizing a total obligation authority withhold technique,
as appropriate, for future PDI budget requests across the Future
Years Defense Plan.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, with
input from the military services, Indo-Pacific Command, and other
relevant stakeholders, to revise the Department’s guidance for PDI
program selection. This revised guidance should reflect the direc-
tion above and establish consistent processes for component-level
review of PDI selections. The committee further directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to brief the congressional defense committees on
this revised PDI guidance, not later than June 30, 2026.

Sec. 1233—Oversight of United States military posture on

Korea below 28,500 or to complete the transition of wartime oper-
ational control of the United States-Republic of Korea Combined

Korea-led command until 90 days after the Secretary of Defense
submits an assessment and certification to the appropriate commit-
tees of the Congress regarding such action.
Sec. 1234—Limitation on availability of funds for travel ex-
penses of the Office of the Secretary of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of 25 percent of the funding authorized
for travel expenses for the Office of the Secretary of Defense until
various overdue reports related to the Indo-Pacific are submitted to
the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1235—Bolstering industrial resilience with allies in
Indo-Pacific region
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State,
to establish and maintain a security cooperation initiative to
strengthen cooperation among the defense industrial bases of the
United States and allied and partner countries in the Indo-Pacific
region. In addition, the Secretary of Defense is required to provide
the congressional defense committees with a report outlining
progress in establishing the initiative on a recurring basis begin-
ning on January 1, 2027 and annually thereafter until 2031. The
provision would also require the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives not later than December 1, 2026 and
annually thereafter until 2030.
Sec. 1236—Modification of Taiwan security cooperation ini-
tiative
The committee recommends a provision that would modify the
Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative authorized by section 1323
of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–
159) by adding medical equipment, supplies, and related combat
casualty care capabilities as a category of authorized assistance
under the initiative.

courage the Secretary of Defense to invite the naval forces of Tai-
wan to participate, as appropriate, in any Rim of the Pacific exer-

The provision would also require the Secretary to provide a written

dating the National Disclosure Policy (NDP–1), not later than 180
days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and on an annual
basis thereafter to maintain currency with the rapid pace of tech-
nology change. In addition, the provision would direct the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy to provide a report to the congres-
sional defense committees, on an annual basis, describing updates
to the NDP–1 and any associated implementation challenges.
Sec. 1259—Improvements to security cooperation workforce
and defense acquisition workforce
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to issue guidance regarding foreign military
sales to the security cooperation workforce and the acquisition
workforce and modify the Foreign Military Sales Continuous Proc-
ess Improvement Board established by section 1210 of the Service-
member Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) to speci-
fy that three members of the board shall not be employees of the
Department of Defense or members of the Armed Forces.
Sec. 1260—Expansion of country prioritization
The committee recommends a provision that would clarify that
the Secretary of Defense may assign a Defense Priorities Allocation
System rating for foreign military sales.
In an effort to expedite the delivery of defense items to strategi-
cally important American partners and allies, the committee urges
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment
(USD(A&S)) to prioritize systems for sale to Israel, Japan, the Re-
public of Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, member countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, major defense partners, and
members of the national technology and industrial base, including
through use of Defense Priorities and Allocations System ratings.
Filling the requirements of America’s closest allies as quickly as
possible once defense articles have been approved for transfer is a
force multiplier in pursuit of U.S. national defense. The committee
believes the USD (A&S) should recognize this and fully account for
it in its contracting practices.
Sec. 1261—Streamlining and expediting sales of defense arti-
cles and services
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to develop an acquisition strategy that estab-

lishes alternative acquisition paths for the procurement of Foreign
Military Sales. The provision also allows prime contractors to begin
the process of acquiring long-lead government furnished equipment
prior to the execution of a signed commercial contract or of a letter
of offer and acceptance.
Sec. 1262—Redesignation of the Africa Center for Strategic
Studies as the James M. Inhofe Center for Africa Secu-
rity Studies
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 342 of title 10, United States Code, to designate the Africa
Center for Strategic Studies as the James M. Inhofe Center for Af-
rica Security Studies.
Sec. 1263—Establishment of program to promote participa-
tion of foreign students in the Senior Reserve Officers’
Training Corps
The committee recommends a provision that would establish a
program to promote the participation of foreign students in the
Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.
Sec. 1264—Modification of authority for assistance in sup-
port of Department of Defense accounting for missing
United States Government personnel
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 408(a) of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Depart-
ment of Defense to procure goods and services from foreign nations
to assist the Department in its mission to recover and account for
missing United States Government personnel.
Items of Special Interest
AUKUS senior civilian official
The committee reaffirms the requirement for the Department of
Defense, as required by section 1332 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) to: (1)
Designate a senior civilian official of the Department who shall be
responsible for overseeing the Department’s activities relating to
the AUKUS partnership; and (2) Provide semiannual briefings to
the congressional defense committees on the status of the AUKUS
agreement not later than April 1st and October 1st of each year.
Therefore, the committee directs that the Department’s senior civil-
ian official for AUKUS be identified to the committee in writing
and that the semiannual briefing be provided to the committee not
later than October 1, 2025.
Contracting support relative to Taiwan
The committee notes that section 6 of the Taiwan Relations Act
(Public Law 96–8) directs that transactions by any agency of the
U.S. Government relative to Taiwan shall be carried out by or
through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). The committee
understands that AIT has limited capacity to provide contracting
support for non-AIT requirements. Therefore, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to engage with the Secretary of State, the

Director of the AIT, and the heads of other departments and agen-
cies, as appropriate, for the purpose of establishing a process for
ensuring timely contracting support for non-AIT requirements.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than December 31, 2025, describing the outcome of such en-
gagements.
Cooperation between United States and Vietnam
The committee notes the critical role that joint United States-
Vietnam efforts to address legacy issues related to the Vietnam
War have played in fostering bilateral security cooperation and
strengthening the United States-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership. The committee commends the Departments of Defense
and State for continuing to fulfill U.S. commitments to fund dioxin
(Agent Orange) clean-up operations at former U.S. bases and
unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance programs, to assist those se-
verely disabled as a result of UXO accidents and dioxin exposure,
and to enhance Vietnam’s capacity to identify the remains of Viet-
namese missing since the war. The committee supports the con-
tinuation of such efforts.
Department of Defense support to maritime law enforce-
ment activities in Indo-Pacific region
The committee believes that the Department of Defense must
continue to support the U.S. Coast Guard as it works with our al-
lies and partners to address challenges in the Indo-Pacific region,
including those posed by illegal, unreported, and unregulated fish-
ing (IUU) and illegal trafficking of people and drugs. The com-
mittee notes that section 1252 of the James M. Inhofe National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263)
authorized the use of funds under the Indo-Pacific Maritime Secu-
rity Initiative to facilitate the participation of U.S. Coast Guard
personnel in, and the use of U.S. Coast Guard capabilities for,
training, exercises, and other activities with foreign countries.
Therefore, not later than October 1, 2025, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Commandant of
the U.S. Coast Guard, to provide a briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees on the demand for U.S. Coast Guard capabilities
and expertise in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area of responsi-
bility. At a minimum, the briefing should include an identification
of: (1) Opportunities for the U.S. Coast Guard to play a greater role
in supporting the Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance in
the Indo-Pacific region; (2) Opportunities for the U.S. Coast Guard
to assume additional responsibilities in the Indo-Pacific region to
alleviate the demand for U.S. Navy capabilities; (3) Opportunities
to increase engagement with and support to foreign partners; and
(4) Any additional legislative or resourcing changes necessary to
take advantage of opportunities identified above.
Enhancing United States-Mexico military communication in
support of border operations

States-Mexico border. The committee recognizes that Department
of Defense (DOD) support to the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) may benefit from clear and consistent communication chan-
nels with Mexican military forces operating across the United
States-Mexico border.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in co-
ordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Sec-
retary of State, to submit a report, not later than March 1, 2026,
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations of the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the
House of Representatives detailing current practices, identified
gaps, and planned enhancements to United States-Mexico military
communication during border-related DOD support to DHS. The re-
port should: (1) Identify existing communication protocols, liaison
arrangements, Memorandums of Agreement, or other coordination
instruments between the United States military and the Mexican
Secretariat of National Defense and Secretariat of the Navy rel-
evant to border operations; (2) Assess gaps or limitations in current
bilateral military communication that may affect coordination,
deconfliction, or situational awareness during DOD support mis-
sions along the southern border, including identifying any statutory
or regulatory changes needed to facilitate better communication; (3)
Ensure that appropriate communication procedures, language capa-
bilities, and liaison officers are in place to support operational co-
ordination, consistent with operational security and applicable
legal authorities; and (4) Develop and implement improvements as
necessary to strengthen real-time operational communication be-
tween United States and Mexican military personnel in the context
of United States border support activities.
Foreign Military Sales contract modifications
The committee notes that there may be an understanding in the
defense acquisition workforce that an existing contract for defense
articles may not be modified more than once a year for the pur-
poses of filling a foreign sale with economy of scale. This results
in a delay of at least a year, assuming changes in price over that
period do not create additional delays to get on contract. The com-
mittee is aware of no legal, regulatory, or policy directive sup-
porting this practice.
Foreign Military Sales timeline
The committee continues to be concerned regarding the timeli-
ness of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, particularly
delays in deliveries of defense articles to foreign partners, which
can undermine partners’ military readiness and defense.
Therefore, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act, and not less frequently than once every 180 days there-
after until the earlier of either the date all recommendations devel-
oped by the Department of Defense’s ‘‘Tiger Team’’ to optimize the
FMS process are implemented or otherwise closed or the date that
is 3 years from the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary

of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as the Comp-
troller General of the United States, a report on the progress of the
Continuous Process Improvement Board (CPIB), including the sta-
tus of its implementation of these recommendations.
The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct an
independent evaluation of the actions taken by the Secretary of De-
fense to carry out the requirements of this section. The Comptroller
General shall brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives on the contents of the evalua-
tion of the Secretary of Defense’s report not later than 12 months
after it is submitted. The Comptroller General will also conduct a
report on the progress and effectiveness of CPIB efforts, including
any legislative and administrative recommendations to enhance
CPIB timelines and outcomes. This report will be delivered to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives in a mutually agreed upon timeframe.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing
The committee believes that illegal, unreported, and unregulated
(IUU) fishing constitutes a threat to the sovereignty, economic via-
bility, and national security of allies and partners of the United
States, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. The committee notes
that IUU fishing has been used as a form of coercion by the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and, according to the annual Department
of Defense report titled ‘‘Military and Security Developments In-
volving the People’s Republic of China,’’ Chinese vessels partici-
pating in IUU fishing have been protected and facilitated by the
Chinese Maritime Militia. The committee also notes that address-
ing the challenges posed by IUU fishing requires coordination
across various departments and agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment.
Therefore, the committee urges the Secretary of Defense, as ap-
propriate, to: (1) Continue engagement with allies and partners in
the Indo-Pacific region, especially in the Pacific Islands, to address
the challenges posed by IUU fishing; (2) Provide assistance, using
existing authorities available to the Secretary of Defense, to build
the capacity of priority foreign partners to address the challenges
posed by IUU fishing; (3) Leverage maritime domain awareness ca-
pabilities, including those available under the Indo-Pacific Mari-
time Security Initiative, to enhance the capabilities of priority part-
ners to address the challenges posed by IUU fishing; (4) Support
the collection and analysis of data on IUU fishing; (5) Consult with
the Interagency Working Group on IUU fishing and develop rec-
ommendations for establishing an IUU fishing data and informa-
tion sharing center; and (6) Ensure Department components coordi-
nate IUU-related activities with the Economic Defense Unit estab-
lished elsewhere in this Act.
The committee also directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later than Oc-
tober 1, 2025, regarding contributions by the Department to ad-
dressing the challenges posed by IUU fishing in concert with other
interagency and foreign partners.

Indo-Pacific Multilateral Security Cooperation Initiatives
The committee notes that section 1208 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) authorizes the Sec-
retary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State,
to accept funds, defense articles, and defense services from foreign
governments for mutually agreed upon purposes to carry out secu-
rity cooperation programs and activities of the Department of De-
fense. The committee believes this authority holds significant po-
tential for facilitating multilateral security cooperation activities in
the Indo-Pacific region.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to seek
to engage with appropriate officials from Japan, Australia, the Re-
public of Korea, and other partners, as appropriate, for the purpose
of establishing multilateral security cooperation initiatives with the
national security forces of mutual foreign partners in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. The objective should be to: (1) Build the capacity of the
national security forces of mutual foreign partners in the Indo-Pa-
cific region; (2) Enhance interoperability among participating na-
tional security forces of such partners; and (3) Coordinate, de-con-
flict, and efficiently leverage the security assistance efforts of the
United States, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and other
partners in the Indo-Pacific region.
Additionally, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than December 31, 2025, to provide a report to the congres-
sional defense committees regarding efforts to establish multilat-
eral security cooperation initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region, in-
cluding using the authority provided under section 1208 of Public
Law 118–159. At a minimum, the report should include: (1) A de-
scription of efforts to establish multilateral security cooperation ini-
tiatives in the Indo-Pacific region, including consultations with ap-
propriate officials from Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea,
and other partners; (2) An identification of any additional resources
or authorities necessary to support such initiatives; and (3) Any
other matters the Secretary of Defense considers relevant.
Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance strategy
Sahel
The committee notes that due to recent security developments in
the Sahel, United States posture in the region has shifted dramati-
cally. Several changes, like the withdrawal of United States forces
from Niger, have hindered the United States military’s ability to
conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mis-
sions in the Sahel.
Therefore, the committee directs the Commander, U.S. Africa
Command (AFRICOM) to provide a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 1, 2026, that describes efforts to develop an
integrated ISR strategy to increase domain awareness in the Sahel
for the purpose of force protection and to assist partners in the re-
gion as they work to protect their people, infrastructure, and terri-
tory from violent extremist organizations, criminal networks, and
other entities that threaten security and stability in the Sahel.

The report required shall include the following elements: (1) An
assessment of the threats posed to countries in the Sahel by violent
extremist organizations, criminal networks, and other actors that
threaten security and stability; (2) An assessment of current ISR
capabilities in the Sahel, including overflight rights and basing
considerations; (3) A description of efforts to engage ally and part-
ner countries in AFRICOM’s area of responsibility to establish or
enhance ISR architecture, including overflight rights and basing;
(4) An identification of the elements of such an architecture that
may be acquired and operated by ally and partner countries in
AFRICOM’s area of responsibility, and a list of such elements for
each such ally and partner; (5) An identification of the elements of
such an architecture that may only be provided and operated by
members of the U.S. Armed Forces; (6) An identification of any
challenge to optimizing such an architecture in AFRICOM’s area of
responsibility; and (7) Any other matter the Commander considers
relevant.
Kurdish Peshmerga forces
The committee commends the Department of Defense’s commit-
ment to defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by sup-
porting vetted partner forces to maintain pressure against ISIS.
The committee also commends the Department’s support for the
Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund as it provides targeted support
to sustain partner forces and increasing vetted partner force capa-
bility.
The committee notes that the 2025 Annual Threat Assessment
by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence assesses that
ISIS remains the world’s largest Islamic terrorist organization and
has sought to gain momentum from high-profile attacks and con-
tinues to rely on its most capable branches and globally dispersed
leadership to weather degradation. The committee also notes that
the Kurdish Peshmerga forces and the Iraqi Security Forces have
long served as vital partners of the United States in degrading and
defeating the threat from ISIS. Therefore, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing, not later than De-
cember 30, 2025, to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives on the Counter-ISIS Train
and Equip Fund, the status of equipment delivery to Kurdish
Peshmerga forces, and plans to improve the ability of the Kurdish
Peshmerga forces to support counterterrorism operations with the
Iraqi Security Forces and the United States.
People’s Republic of China security detection equipment at
strategic ports
The committee is aware that Tongfang Technology, a state-owned
enterprise in the People’s Republic of China and the parent com-
pany of Nuctech Company Ltd. (Nuctech), was added to the De-
partment of Commerce’s Entity List in 2020. Nuctech provides se-
curity detection equipment and technology, including cargo scan-
ning systems deployed at seaports and border crossings in more
than 170 countries. This includes a heavy presence in North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization member nations and in countries that fa-
cilitate the transit of U.S. military supplies and equipment. The

committee is concerned that a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned
enterprise overseeing screening technologies at strategic transit
points could pose a threat to military operational security and oper-
ational effectiveness.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than January 30, 2026, on measures being taken to assess and
mitigate the security threats posed to operational security and pos-
sible covert identification and tracking of U.S. defense articles tra-
versing through transportation hubs that use Nuctech scanners.
Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreements
The committee emphasizes that defense-related acquisitions from
qualified sources under Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agree-
ments should remain exempt from any tariffs or trade restrictions.
The committee urges the Department of Defense and relevant
interagency stakeholders to preserve existing exemptions and en-
sure that future trade actions do not hinder defense procurement
or compromise national security priorities.
Security cooperation with Co-operative Republic of Guyana
The committee notes that in 2025, the U.S. Secretary of State
and the Guyanese Minister of Foreign Affairs signed a memo-
randum of understanding (MOU) to deepen security cooperation be-
tween the two countries and to address regional challenges to
counter transnational crime and deter drug trafficking in the Car-
ibbean region. The committee encourages the Department of De-
fense to strengthen the military-to-military partnership with the
Co-operative Republic of Guyana to build upon the 2025 MOU.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than October 1, 2026, to submit to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report
on: (1) U.S. security cooperation with the Co-operative Republic of
Guyana for the past 5 years; and (2) Any plan for future security
cooperation with the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.
State Partnership Program
The committee notes the importance of the State Partnership
Program (SPP) in building cooperation with our allies and part-
ners. This cooperation can include working together to build inno-
vative defense capabilities to address the security needs of the
United States, its State Partnership Program partner, or both.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chief of the National Guard
Bureau, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment and the Under Secretary of Defense
for Research and Engineering, and other relevant elements of the
Department of Defense, to provide a briefing to the Senate Armed
Services Committee, not later than March 31, 2026, on the SPP.
The briefing should, at a minimum, address the following: (1) A de-
scription of SPP activities that involve collaboration on technology;
(2) A description of any opportunities to utilize SPP activities with
foreign partners to collaborate on and develop emerging tech-
nologies; and (3) Any other matters the Chief of the National
Guard Bureau deems relevant.

Strategic ports reporting
The committee notes that the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
is seeking to establish a stronger logistics and basing infrastruc-
ture overseas to allow the PRC to deploy and sustain military
forces at further distances. The committee notes that PRC access
to select foreign ports poses a potential impact to U.S. national se-
curity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in co-
ordination with relevant Federal departments and agencies, to pro-
vide a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 10, 2026,
outlining:
(1) A list of strategic foreign ports operated, controlled, or
owned directly or indirectly by the PRC;
(2) An assessment of any impact to U.S. national security re-
sulting from PRC control of such foreign ports;
(3) A description of Department of Defense efforts to coordi-
nate with other Federal departments and agencies to counter
or mitigate the national security threats posed by PRC control
of such foreign ports; and
(4) Any other matters deemed relevant by the Secretary.
Strategy on increasing membership in the Comprehensive
Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement
The committee recognizes the strategic importance of the Com-
prehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement
(CSIPA), signed in Washington, D.C., on September 13, 2023, as a
mechanism for enhancing regional cooperation on defense, eco-
nomic development, and technological innovation. CSIPA has
played a key role in improving joint military readiness, fostering
shared economic interests, and advancing scientific collaboration
among member states in the Middle East.
The committee is particularly interested in how CSIPA has sup-
ported effective multinational responses to emerging security
threats, including Houthi attacks on merchant vessels in the Red
Sea following October 7, 2023, and the deterrence posture main-
tained through U.S. naval operations in the region. The potential
of further expansion of CSIPA membership would strengthen re-
gional stability, improve collective deterrence against the Islamic
Republic of Iran and other malign actors, and advance U.S. stra-
tegic objectives.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than July 1, 2026, that
includes, at a minimum: (1) An assessment of the strategic benefits
of CSIPA to regional and global security; (2) An assessment of
CSIPA’s operational value to the Department of Defense and part-
ners in the region following the Red Sea attacks; (3) An assessment
of how CSIPA leverages U.S. military assets such as the Fifth Fleet
to address regional threats; (4) Identification of potential modifica-
tions to the CSIPA framework that would support broader regional
participation; (5) An evaluation of the resource and capability re-
quirements necessary to expand CSIPA membership; and (6) Rec-

terests, including U.S. Africa Command-led African Lion training
exercises, which are the largest of their kind on the African con-
tinent; counterterrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing; and
the National Guard’s State Partnership Program. The committee
continues to monitor the relationship with an eye toward facili-
tating greater security cooperation.

fense-wide, at the levels identified in section 4501 of division D of
this Act.
Sec. 1404—Defense Inspector General
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize ap-
propriations for the Office of the Inspector General of the Depart-
ment of Defense at the levels identified in section 4501 of division
D of this Act.
Sec. 1405—Defense Health Program
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize ap-
propriations for Defense Health Program activities at the levels
identified in section 4501 of division D of this Act.
Subtitle B—National Defense Stockpile
Sec. 1411—Modifications to Strategic and Critical Materials
Stock Piling Act
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 98d(b) of title 50, United States Code, to authorize disposal of
materials from the National Defense Stockpile if such disposal was
included in the annual materials plan submitted to congressional
defense committees and if the Stockpile Manager notifies congres-
sional defense committees not later than 15 days after disposing of
the material. The provision would also amend sections 98d(a)(2),
98e(d)(1), 98e(d)(2) of title 50, United States Code, to standardize
existing wait periods to all be 30 days.

The committee recommends a provision that would authorize an
appropriation of $77.0 million from the Armed Forces Retirement
Home Trust Fund for the operation of the Armed Forces Retire-
ment Home for fiscal year 2026.
Items of Special Interest
Advancing cobalt production in the United States
The committee continues to emphasize the importance of miti-
gating dependencies on the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for
batteries and other defense component supply chains by investing
in U.S. processing and refining capability. Cobalt sulfate is essen-
tial to battery technologies, and cobalt metal is vital in a variety
of aerospace and defense weapon systems. Both are fundamental to
a secure military and high-technology economy. Without assured
access to them, nearly every military platform and advanced tech-
nology that the United States depends on would be inoperable. The
committee remains concerned that America’s substantial depend-
ence on the PRC for processing of cobalt poses significant risks to
military readiness and economic competitiveness.
Domestic recycling of critical minerals
The committee commends the ongoing work of the Department
of Defense to expand sources for the National Defense Stockpile for
germanium through recycling. The committee believes that pro-
grams like the Strategic Material Recovery and Reuse Program
(SMRRP) can foster the creation of new sources for strategic and
critical materials to improve supply chain shortfalls.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Acquisition and Sustainment to provide a one-time brief-
ing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than March
1, 2026, on an assessment of the ability to leverage best practices
from existing recycling efforts of the SMRRP to potentially expand
and increase the scale to recycle, reuse, or otherwise recover any
additional materials, such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, and any other
materials determined to be a strategic and critical material under

Section 26:
section 3(a) of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act
(50 U.S.C. 98b(a)).
Material preference for the National Defense Stockpile
The committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense (DOD) is vulnerable to supply chain uncertainty for certain
critical and strategic materials. Accordingly, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to brief the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
March 1, 2026, on: (1) The identification of 10 materials or prod-
ucts already included in the DOD National Defense Stockpile,
which the DOD could procure to improve domestic production and
decrease national security vulnerabilities; (2) Recommended or re-
quired amounts of material for domestic procurement for each iden-

tified material or product for the next 3 years; (3) A public list of
materials or products and target percentages that is releasable to
industry, allies, and partners; and (4) Any potential challenges en-
countered by increasing domestic sourcing for such materials.
Reimbursement of Armed Forces Retirement Home for med-
ical care provided to TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries
The committee is aware that the Armed Forces Retirement Home
(AFRH) continues to face challenges in receiving reimbursement for
medical care it provides to residents who are eligible for health
care under the TRICARE program. The Joint Explanatory State-
ment to Accompany the Servicemember Quality of Life Improve-
ment and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025
(Public Law 118–159) required the Secretary of Defense to brief the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on the legal and policy issues related to the inabil-
ity to provide reimbursement for AFRH resident healthcare. Based
upon that briefing, the committee is aware of two existing impedi-
ments to TRICARE reimbursing the AFRH for the care provided to
eligible TRICARE beneficiaries.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1)
Progress made on transitioning the AFRH’s current health records
system to MHS Genesis; (2) The determination made on the ability
of the AFRH’s existing health record system to provide data needed
for TRICARE billing and reimbursement, including specifics about
any changes to the system required to effectuate TRICARE billing
and reimbursement and an estimate of the cost for making these
changes; (3) Any statutory impediments related to appropriations
issues; and (4) Any other matters the Secretary determines rel-
evant to enabling reimbursement for healthcare offered to
TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries at the AFRH.
Securing niobium supply
The committee supports the ongoing efforts of the Department of
Defense to increase the domestic production of high-purity niobium
to meet the requirements of the defense industrial base. The com-
mittee encourages the Department to continue eliminating depend-
ence on foreign sources for strategic and critical materials, espe-
cially those in supply chains located in, or with beneficial owner-
ship in, foreign entities of concern.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than March
1, 2026, on the: (1) Progress of niobium-related investments or
projects within the Department; (2) An estimate of how many De-
partment of Defense programs rely on foreign sources of niobium;
and (3) Approximate timelines to transition the niobium supply
chain to domestic or allied sources of supply.
Support for continued focus on critical mineral investment
The committee supports the Department of Defense’s efforts to
secure domestic and allied sources of critical minerals and mate-
rials through Industrial Base Resilience program investments. The

TITLE XV—SPACE ACTIVITIES, STRATEGIC
PROGRAMS, AND INTELLIGENCE MATTERS
Subtitle A—Space Activities
Sec. 1501—Delay in implementation of environmental as-
sessment for rocket cargo test and demonstration at
Johnston Atoll
The committee recommends a provision that would delay the im-
plementation of the Environmental Assessment for Rocket Cargo
Test and Demonstration at Johnston Atoll, United States (EAXX–
007–57–USF–1728497279, March 3, 2025) until the notice of intent
is further modified to include the consideration of the Ronald
Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, U.S. Army Garrison—
Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands.
The committee notes that this test site has long been the Major
Range Test Facility Base for missile defense and rocket launch ac-
tivities and should be considered in such a site selection for cost,
environmental impact, and existing capability for range instrumen-
tation, given the concept of operations for rocket cargo.
Sec. 1502—Study on future space launch capacity
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive study on future
space launch capacity, including long-term capacity, infrastructure,
and strategic viability of existing and potential heavy and super
heavy space launch sites. A report of the findings of this study will
be delivered to the House and Senate Committees on Armed Serv-
ices not later than March 31, 2026.
The committee supports the Department of Defense’s effort to as-
sess the long-term capacity and sustainability of domestic space
launch infrastructure for heavy and super heavy vehicles. As na-
tional security space launch demand continues to increase, driven
by both defense and commercial sector growth, the committee be-
lieves it is critical to ensure that existing sites, including Cape Ca-
naveral Space Force Station and Vandenberg Space Force Base, re-
main capable, efficient, and resilient. The committee also supports
the consideration of alternate or complementary launch locations
that could enhance strategic flexibility, reduce congestion, and sup-
port future mission requirements.
Sec. 1503—Acquisition and operation of space systems for
space warfighting and control
The committee recommends a provision stipulating that any
weapon systems intended to produce space control effects to adver-
sary satellite systems be acquired and operated by the U.S. Space
Force, with commercial augmentation as required. The provision

would further allow for a national security waiver to be granted,
with the stipulation that the Secretary of Defense would be re-
quired to provide notice to the congressional defense committees
within 10 days of exercising any such waiver.
Sec. 1504—Blast damage assessment guide for space vehicles
at Air Force launch complexes
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Air Force to publish a liquid oxygen (LOX) and
methane blast damage assessment guide for space launch vehicles
using U.S. Air Force launch range complexes within 1 year of the
date of enactment of this act, with a notice and one-time briefing
to the congressional defense committees within 30 days of publica-
tion. The provision would provide for a waiver based on reasons of
national security or impracticability, provided that the Secretary
proposes to the congressional defense committees a one-time alter-
nate date of publication of the LOX-methane blast damage assess-
ment guide.
The committee notes that the provision expresses the commit-
tee’s expectation that the LOX-methane blast damage assessment
guide be developed consistent with section 1601 of the Servicemem-
ber Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
The committee further notes that the provision requires the 1
year date of publication of the LOX-methane blast damage assess-
ment guide will be approximately 2 years since the original re-
quirement, established in section 1601(b) of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159), to determine a
process through which a scientifically based yield determination
can be assessed for space launch vehicles while in flight, and that
2 years should provide ample time for the publication of such a
guide, given the heavy demand that is now occurring on U.S. Air
Force launch range complexes.
The committee notes that section 172(h), title 10, United States
Code, delegates such authority to the Commanders of the Space
Launch Deltas responsible for the launch of space flight vehicles.
Therefore, the ability to execute the proposed provision should be
within the purview at a minimum of the Secretary of the Air Force
and more appropriately at the Space Launch Delta in order to com-
ply with the timeframe of the provision.
Sec. 1505—Acquisition of space-based tactical data capa-
bility
The committee recommends a provision that ensures, to the max-
imum extent practicable, that space acquisitions employ procedures
to maximize competition for programs to deliver space-based tac-
tical data and that the products from such vendors comply with
interfaces and standards that maximize resilience and interoper-
ability with Department of Defense systems.

Sec. 1506—Use of middle tier acquisition program for pro-
liferated warfighter space architecture of the Space De-
velopment Agency
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the Di-
rector of the Space Development Agency to use a middle tier acqui-
sition program for the rapid fielding of satellites and associated
systems for tranches 4, 5, and 6 of the proliferated warfighter
space architecture.
Sec. 1507—Continuation of operation of Defense Meteorolog-
ical Satellite Program
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to continue to operate the Defense Meteorolog-
ical Satellite Program until the end of the functional life of the sat-
ellites in orbit as of the date of the enactment of this Act. The pro-
vision would further direct the Secretary to brief the congressional
defense committees on the status of the program, its requirements
and capabilities, its projected annual and lifecycle costs, and the
projected costs to replace the program’s functions.
Subtitle B—Nuclear Forces
Sec. 1511—Matters relating to intercontinental ballistic mis-
siles of the United States
The committee recommends a provision that would establish a
target date of initial operational capability for the LGM–35A Sen-
tinel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system and
minimum inventory requirements for ICBMs and ICBM launch fa-
cilities. The provision would also prohibit the use of fiscal year
2026 funds to reduce the quantity of deployed ICBMs to a number
less than 400, with exceptions for maintenance, sustainment, or re-
placement.
Sec. 1512—Matters relating to Air Force Global Strike Com-
mand
The committee recommends a provision that would: (1) Reverse
any changes made to Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
manpower, composition, roles, or responsibilities related to efforts
to establish an Integrated Capabilities Office or an Integrated Ca-
pabilities Command (ICC) since October 1, 2023; (2) Limit the ex-
penditure of Air Force funds until the congressional defense com-
mittees are notified of such reversal; (3) Limit the authority of the
Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force
to make future changes to AFGSC without concurrence from the
Secretary of Defense and the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command
(STRATCOM); (4) Make several technical amendments to section
9040 of title 10, United States Code; (5) Codify Air Force Mission
Directive 63; and (6) Require the Secretary of the Air Force to up-
date Air Force Program Action Directive D16–01 within 90 days of
the date of the enactment of this Act.
The committee is deeply troubled by the Air Force’s apparent dis-
regard of the limitations on alterations to AFGSC enacted by sec-
tion 1631 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public

Law 118–159). The Air Force’s failure to fully inform the committee
of plans to ensure that future adjustments to the composition,
roles, or responsibilities of AFGSC will not adversely affect the
command’s capability to meet operational requirements of
STRATCOM or Department of Defense activities to achieve presi-
dential nuclear employment guidance objectives prior to such alter-
ations appear to contravene the clear intent of the provision.
The committee appreciates recent Air Force announcements that
nuclear forces will be exempted from further development of the
ICC until the concept has further matured. The structure of
AFGSC as a four-star major command is a direct result of institu-
tional lapses in senior Air Force leadership in, and inadequate
prioritization of, the nuclear deterrence mission immediately prior
to AFGSC’s elevation. Any efforts to dismantle such organizational
reforms without deliberate review and thoughtful consideration of
the ramifications would indicate to the committee an ignorance of
the causes that led to such failures and risk reducing our con-
fidence in future reform efforts, well-intentioned as they may be.
The committee is adamant that such lapses cannot be allowed to
recur and remains wary of any adjustments to AFGSC’s roles, re-
sponsibilities, or composition that could reduce the prioritization of,
or leadership attention to, this critical capability.
The committee will closely monitor Air Force compliance with the
requirements of this provision and will consider the use of all avail-
able mechanisms in pursuit of this objective, including reviews by
the Government Accountability Office and the Department of De-
fense Inspector General.
Sec. 1513—Adjustment to bomber aircraft nuclear certifi-
cation requirement
The committee recommends a provision that would clarify the
timing for the Air Force to complete operational certification of the
B–21 bomber with the AGM–181 Long Range Standoff Weapon.
Sec. 1514—Limitation on availability of funds pending estab-
lishment of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nu-
clear Deterrence, Chemical, and Biological Defense Pol-
icy and Programs
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 funds for the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and
for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy until the
Department of Defense has: (1) Updated all applicable regulations,
polices, and departmental guidance to reflect the establishment of
the Office of the ASD(NDCBDPP); and (2) Realigned personnel, fa-
cilities, and budgetary resources to reflect the implementation of

Section 27:
section 138(b)(4) of title 10, United States Code.
The committee welcomes the establishment of the position of As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Deterrence, Chemical, and
Biological Defense Policy and Programs (ASD(NDCBDPP)) but re-
mains deeply concerned about the Department of Defense’s ap-
proach to establishing the organization intended to assist the ASD
in carrying out his or her assigned responsibilities. The Depart-
ment’s decision to artificially separate the personnel management

systems for employees formerly assigned to the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Office of the Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S))
undermines the cohesion of the newly established Office of the
ASD(NDCBDPP) and adds unnecessary redundancy and complexity
to the management activities therein. Further, the Department ap-
pears to have failed to reallocate resources and staff expertise from
within the OUSD(A&S) to support the ASD(NDCBDPP)’s statutory
mandate to serve as the ‘‘principal Department of Defense civilian
responsible for oversight of portfolio management for nuclear forces
established by section 499c of [title 10, United States Code]’’. The
Congressional Budget Office recently released a report that esti-
mates the Department of Defense expects to spend approximately
$95.0 billion annually over the next decade to operate, sustain, and
modernize all aspects of the nuclear forces of the United States. In
order to effectively discharge the statutory responsibilities assigned
to it, the OASD(NDCBDPP) must be provided with the expertise
and resourcing required to effectively serve as the ‘‘principal civil-
ian adviser to the Secretary of Defense on nuclear deterrence poli-
cies, operations, and associated programs within the senior man-
agement of the Department of Defense’’. The committee notes that
the primary rationale for establishing the ASD(NDCBDPP) was to
improve collaboration among the various offices within the Office
of the Secretary of Defense with responsibilities relating to the nu-
clear deterrence mission by organically consolidating the various
lines of effort under a unified organization. The Department’s ini-
tial approach to implementing this direction fails to meet this ob-
jective and highlights precisely why Congressional action was re-
quired.
Sec. 1515—Adjustment to responsibilities of Nuclear Weap-
ons Council
The committee recommends a provision that makes a series of
technical adjustments to section 179 of title 10, United States
Code, to further clarify the responsibilities of the Nuclear Weapons
Council.
Sec. 1516—Limitation on availability of funds pending noti-
fication of tasking authority delegation
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 travel funds for the Sec-
retary of the Air Force until the Secretary of Defense submits the
notification required by section 1638(e) of the James M. Inhofe Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law
117–263).
Sec. 1517—Modification of requirement for nuclear-armed,
sea-launched cruise missile initial operational capability
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1640 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to authorize a middle-tier acquisition
pathway and adjust the target date of initial operational capability
for the nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missile from 2034 to

Section 28:
2032.

Congress established section 3602 of title 10, United States Code
(10 U.S.C. 3602), ‘‘Middle tier of acquisition for rapid prototyping
and rapid fielding,’’ as one of six adaptive acquisition pathways for
the Department of Defense to improve the Department’s capability
‘‘to rapidly develop fieldable prototypes to demonstrate new capa-
bilities and meet emerging military needs.’’
The sea launched cruise missile-nuclear (SLCM–N), as author-
ized by section 1640 of the Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Au-
thorization Act, is intended to rapidly deploy a cruise missile using
existing technologies and mature designs as much as possible to re-
duce cost and shorten fielding timelines. As such, the committee
believes the use of a middle-tier rapid prototyping authority found
in 10 U.S.C. 3602 has the potential to support the objectives of the
SLCM–N program.
Therefore, the committee directs the Government Accountability
Office to assess the effectiveness of this authority, and any related
authorities, in supporting the objectives of the SLCM–N program
and brief the congressional defense committees, not later than
March 31, 2026, on the results of this assessment and offer rec-
ommendations for improving its utilization for this ongoing effort.
Sec. 1518—Pilot program for unmanned aerial vehicle re-
supply to launch control facilities
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of the Air Force to carry out a pilot program over a pe-
riod of up to 3 years to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of
resupplying intercontinental ballistic missile facilities using un-
manned aircraft systems. The provision further requires the Sec-
retary, should he or she carry out said pilot program, to provide an
annual report, not later than December 1 of each year, on how the
pilot program is supporting Air Force Global Strike Command re-
quirements. Finally, the provision requires the Secretary to brief
the congressional defense committees on any statutory adjustments
required to enable or continue the efficient execution of such pro-
gram, not later than 180 days after the Secretary establishes a
pilot program.
Sec. 1519—Limitation on availability of funds pending com-
mencement of annual briefings on implementation of
recommendations by the Congressional Commission on
the Strategic Posture of the United States
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 funds for the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment until
the Under Secretary completes the first annual briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees required by section 1637 of the Serv-
icemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
Sec. 1520—Deep cleaning of launch control centers of the
Air Force Global Strike Command
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
deep cleaning of the underground crew capsules at the three inter-
continental ballistic missile (ICBM) wings every 5 years.

The committee notes that the capsules in some cases are more
than 60 years old, and each crew must spend 24 hours within each
capsule. The Department of Defense’s 2014 Force Improvement
Program required such a deep cleaning, which has since not been
institutionalized. The committee hopes that this provision will help
institutionalize a deep cleaning cycle until such time as the Sen-
tinel ICBM program decommissions and/or replaces the launch con-
trol center and its crew capsule.
Sec. 1521—Limitation on compensation caps
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit any
action to establish or implement a requirement to establish a cap
on reimbursement of compensation and benefits for non-federal em-
ployees under contract with the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration or employees of federally funded research and develop-
ment centers supporting U.S. atomic energy defense activities; the
sustainment and modernization of Department of Defense nuclear
forces; or the development, testing, or fielding of technologies sup-
porting the Golden Dome missile defense architecture.
The committee is concerned that the Office of Management and
Budget’s proposed rule to limit direct compensation is based on an
arbitrary comparison of unrelated factors and imposes unnecessary
restrictions on the capabilities of federally funded research and de-
velopment centers to attract and retain highly qualified technical
personnel at a time when such expertise is in exceptionally high
demand. While the committee supports efforts to ensure costs are
appropriately managed and controlled, actions to address specific
expenditures should be taken within the context of maximizing
overall value of returns on investments of taxpayer dollars. The
committee notes that the Department of Defense and the Depart-
ment of Energy expect to spend potentially hundreds of billions of
dollars over the next decade to operate, sustain, and modernize
U.S. nuclear forces and missile warning and defense capabilities
and does not believe that artificially limiting the ability of either
Department to access critical skill-sets will improve the likelihood
of success in either mission area.
Subtitle C—Missile Defense
Sec. 1531—Matters relating to the Golden Dome missile de-
fense system
The committee recommends a provision that would revise the na-
tional missile defense policy outlined in section 5501 of title 10,
United States Code; require an annual briefing on the development
and deployment of the Golden Dome missile defense system until
it reaches full operational capability; codify the establishment of
the position of Golden Dome for America Direct Reporting Program
Manager; and direct the Director of the Missile Defense Agency to
take such actions as necessary to enter into a contract for the con-
struction of two replacement missile range safety vessels.
The committee recognizes that the development and deployment
of the Golden Dome missile defense system potentially represents
a profound shift in how the United States deters and defends
against missile and aerial threats to the homeland. The committee

understands that, given the purported scale and scope of the Gold-
en Dome system, the requirements, costs, and timing for producing
and fielding the full capability will likely evolve over time. Ensur-
ing this effort successfully delivers the improved defensive capabili-
ties intended will require close cooperation with and oversight by
the Congress.
The committee also directs the Secretary of Defense, acting
through the designated senior defense official or military officer ap-
pointed to lead the development and deployment of the Golden
Dome missile defense system, to provide a one-time briefing to the

Compass Call Aircraft.
The committee notes that the Air Force has begun to produce the
EA–37B Compass Call aircraft to replace the EC–130H Compass
Call aircraft based on a Gulfstream G550 airframe. The committee
further notes, however, that it is not supported by the 350th Spec-
trum Warfare Wing, which was specifically created to support and
provide spectrum warfare capabilities, such as software-in-the-loop
and hardware-in-the-loop, as well as rapid reprogramming of elec-
tronic systems based on a shortened intelligence cycle. This support
to the EA–37B is essential to the mission of the aircraft and is the
fundamental reason the 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing was estab-
lished.
Finally, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to
provide a brief to the congressional defense committees, not later
than March 31, 2026, on the timeframe to implement the provision.

Defense’s authority to modify certain electromagnetic spectrum re-
lied on by the Department of Defense (DOD) until September 30,
2034, or when dynamic spectrum sharing is certified as fully oper-
ational. The provision prohibits modifications to DOD systems op-
erating between 3100–3450 megahertz and 7400–8400 megahertz
unless the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
jointly certify to Congress that such modification would not result
in a loss of capability.
Items of Special Interest
Accelerating space sensors
The committee notes that the President signed The Iron Dome
for America Executive Order (E.O. 14186), which emphasizes that
‘‘the threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles,
and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic
threat facing the United States.’’ The committee further notes that

onstrated successfully on-orbit by the Missile Defense Agency and
is in active production with the Space Development Agency. The
committee believes that the space-based sensor industrial base has
available capacity to accept the additional orders necessary to re-
spond to the Executive Order’s explicit direction to accelerate the
deployment of HBTSS.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide the Senate Armed Services Committee a plan, by not later
than December 1, 2025, to field the minimum number of such vehi-
cles to cover five orbital planes. This plan shall include a descrip-
tion of how the Department of Defense shall procure these vehicles.
Advanced manufacturing methods for hypersonic flight bod-
ies
The committee recognizes the need of the services to drive indus-
trial production capacity to quickly meet urgent needs, drive inno-
vation at the speed of battle, and deliver advanced warfighting ca-
pabilities. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment, to transmit a spend plan and brief the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on
advanced manufacturing practices, including artificial intelligence-
optimized robotic forming as well as additive and subtractive man-
ufacturing, and advanced materials and processing practices for
hypersonic flight bodies that will shorten the time for delivering
these weapon systems.
All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office future plans
The committee commends the All-domain Anomaly Resolution
Office (AARO) for its efforts to provide Congress with analysis of
unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and for its steps to en-
hance coordination and transparency through the public release of
case resolution reports and information papers. The committee be-
lieves this work is critical to ensuring public trust, providing anal-
ysis and credibility to investigations of UAPs, and advancing the
Department of Defense’s ability to detect, analyze, and respond to
anomalous activity across all domains.
As the AARO concludes work on Historical Record Report: Vol-
ume II and advances the GREMLIN sensor suite from research and
development into testing and field demonstration, the committee
affirms that the AARO remains an important focal point for coordi-
nation and execution of the Department’s enduring responsibilities
with respect to UAP inquiry. Sustained investment and strategic
planning are essential to maintaining continuity and mission ac-
complishment.
Therefore, the committee directs the Deputy Secretary of Defense
to brief the congressional defense committees, not later than March
1, 2026, on the strategic vision for the AARO across the Future
Years Defense Plan. The briefing shall include: (1) Priority focus
areas for the next 5 years; (2) Identification of elements within the
Department that may have capabilities or activities that could pro-
vide support to the AARO mission; (3) Anticipated challenges dur-
ing the next 5 years; (4) Projected budgets for the next 5 years that
allow the AARO to continue its role in addressing UAP reports; (5)

Army Indirect Fire Protection Capability High-Power
Microwave program
The committee strongly supports the Army’s ongoing investment
in high-power microwave (HPM) technologies to counter the esca-
lating threat of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to military in-
stallations, assets, and personnel as part of an overall integrated
air and missile defense strategy. The proliferation of UAS—dem-
onstrated by their increasing capability, affordability, and use in
conflicts in Ukraine and the U.S. Central Command area of respon-
sibility—underscores the urgent need for cost-effective, non-kinetic
defense solutions. The committee commends the Army’s efforts, led
by its Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, to evalu-
ate and integrate commercial HPM technologies into the Indirect
Fire Protection Capability High-Power Microwave (IFPC–HPM)
program, delivering prototype systems with residual combat capa-
bility for short-range defense against UAS swarms at fixed and
semi-fixed sites.
The IFPC–HPM program aligns with the National Defense Strat-
egy, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Under Secretary of
Defense for Research and Engineering’s priority focus areas for di-
rected energy. Recent progress—including technology maturation,
sensor integration, and prototype deployments to overseas loca-
tions—demonstrates the program’s potential to enhance layered air
and missile defense architectures. Unlike kinetic interceptors with
high per-shot costs, HPM offers a scalable, operationally effective
solution to neutralize UAS threats, including swarms, at reduced
expense. The committee recognizes the Army’s collaboration with
private industry as a catalyst for advancing this capability.
To ensure the Army can field IFPC–HPM systems at scale across
domestic and overseas installations, the committee encourages the
Army to transition the program to a program of record as soon as
possible.
Automation of intelligence tipping and cueing
The committee notes the potential for automated tipping and
cueing capabilities to make intelligence collection more effective
and efficient.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than March 1, 2026, on the use of automated tipping and cueing
capabilities for intelligence collection by the Department of De-
fense. The briefing should, at a minimum, include the following: (1)
An assessment of ongoing efforts by the Department to automate
tipping and cueing within the Defense Intelligence Enterprise; (2)
Identification of capability shortfalls or gaps in such efforts; (3)
Recommendations for expanding automation capabilities, including
estimated funding requirements; and (4) Any other matters deemed
relevant by the Secretary.

Autonomous Weapons Stations for Strategic Asset Protec-
tion
The committee notes that the rapidly evolving threat posed by
unmanned systems increases the urgency for fielding advanced
counter-unmanned aircraft systems (cUAS) technologies. For exam-
ple, the proliferation of small, unmanned aircraft systems, like first
person view (FPV) drones, presents a significant challenge due to
their low-cost, ease of scalability, and high operational efficiency.
These drones have been shown to be highly effective both in and
out of conflict zones where they have been successfully employed
against military targets, critical infrastructure, and personnel.
Recognizing this urgent threat, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to accelerate deployment of capabilities that will
support a layered defense posture that includes autonomous cUAS
technologies capable of executing the full kill chain—sense, decide,
and act. These systems should be modular, platform-agnostic, and
interoperable with existing command and control architectures.
The Secretary should also consider cost-effective integration with
legacy weapon systems or scalable effector options to conduct ki-
netic and non-kinetic engagements.
Briefing on Defense Property Accountability System appli-
cability to missile wing vehicles maintained by Air
Force Global Strike Command
The committee notes that the wide range of vehicles used in mis-
sile wing operations at F.E. Warren Air Force Base (AFB),
Malmstrom AFB, and Minot AFB routinely experience mileage and
usage far exceeding any other vehicles in the Air Force. The com-
mittee further notes that maintenance vehicles reach end-of-life
mileage easily exceeding 300,000 miles, much of which occurs in
harsh weather conditions. Given these circumstances, the com-
mittee is concerned that the general standard used in the Defense
Property Accountability System (DPAS) to determine end-of-life ve-
hicle replacement does not adequately account for the unique na-
ture of the vehicles used in missile wing operations.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Director of the Defense
Logistics Agency, in coordination with the Commander of Air Force
Global Strike Command, to provide a one-time briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on:
(1) The sufficiency and appropriateness of the DPAS for assessing
the end of life of high-mileage vehicles used under the command
of the 20th Air Force; and (2) What, if any, modifications should
be made to the DPAS to ensure these high mileage vehicles are re-
placed in a timely manner consistent with their job mission.
Briefing on infrastructure rehabilitation plan for restoring
U.S. Army Garrison—Kwajalein Atoll and the Ronald
Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site
The committee acknowledges a moderate increase in senior-level
Department of Defense attention to the condition of the Ronald
Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site and the United States
Army Garrison—Kwajalein Atoll as a whole. However, the com-
mittee remains deeply concerned that efforts to sustain the various

sufficient to adequately support the programs and organizations
that depend upon the viability of the installation to meet
warfighter requirements. The committee is especially mindful of
the likely substantial growth in these demands as development of
the presidentially directed Golden Dome missile defense initiative
progresses.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army, in
coordination with the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of
the Navy, the Commanders of United States Strategic, Space, and
Indo-Pacific Commands, and the Director of the Test Resource
Management Center, to brief the congressional defense committees,
not later than December 1, 2025, on a comprehensive, prioritized,
and resource-loaded plan for rehabilitating Department of Defense
infrastructure on and around the atoll to meet current and pro-
jected operational and testing requirements.
Briefing on resource-loaded plans for sustaining Minuteman

The committee remains concerned about the Air Force’s capa-
bility to sustain the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Commander, Air Force
Global Strike Command, not later than December 31, 2025, to brief
the congressional defense committees on sustainment plans for the
Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) weapon
system until the Sentinel ICBM reaches full operational capability.
The briefing should provide, at a minimum: (1) Identification of
system, subsystem, and critical component lifecycle sustainment ac-
tivities for support equipment, ground infrastructure, command
and control, and flight systems; (2) An assessment of the capacity—
in terms of personnel and support equipment—of Air Force Global
Strike Command to upload additional warheads onto deployed Min-
uteman III ICBMs within existing planned timelines established by
the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command if directed to do so; (3)
Resourcing plans to address any identified shortfalls; (4) Statutory
adjustments, if any, that can streamline efforts to execute outlined
sustainment and upload plans; and (5) Information on any other
matters the Commander, Air Force Global Strike Command be-
lieves relevant.
Briefing on risks to Global Positioning System and associ-
ated positioning, navigation, and timing services
The committee is concerned by potential vulnerabilities to the
Global Positioning System (GPS) and associated positioning, navi-
gation, and timing services, particularly in the context of a conflict
involving the United States or an attack on a U.S. ally. These capa-
bilities are critical to national security, military operations, and
global infrastructure, and their disruption could have significant
consequences.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than October 1, 2026, on the most likely risks to the
Global Positioning System and associated positioning, navigation,
and timing services in order to ensure a comprehensive under-

standing of these risks and the Department of Defense’s (DOD)
preparedness to address them. The briefing shall include the fol-
lowing elements:
(1) A description of risks posed by a lack of access to the
Global Positioning System and associated positioning, naviga-
tion, and timing services during a potential conflict in which
the United States is involved or in the case of an attack on a
U.S. ally; and
(2) An assessment of each of the following:
(a) The capabilities of competitor countries, including
the People’s Republic of China, to degrade or deny U.S. ac-
cess to the Global Positioning System and associated posi-
tioning, navigation, and timing services during a potential
conflict with the United States or in the case of an attack
on a U.S. ally;
(b) Current DOD efforts to develop or procure tech-
nology or systems to provide redundant global positioning
and positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities, in-
cluding space-based and terrestrial-based efforts; and
(c) The ability of the Resilient Global Positioning System
program of the Space Force to achieve, not later than 10
years after the date of the enactment of this Act, full ca-
pacity to provide Global Positioning System resilience to
existing U.S. satellites.
Briefing on Space Force education and potential center for
orbital warfare
The committee notes that in March 2025, Space Force published
a seminal document entitled ‘‘Space Warfighting: A Framework for
Planners’’ that establishes the basic principles for the use of mili-
tary power in space and defines a common strategic framework for
the force to achieve space superiority. The committee notes that, in
the foreword to this document, Space Force’s Chief of Space Oper-
ations stresses the importance of Guardians ‘‘at every level’’ being
educated and trained to carry out the force’s mission in accordance
with the framework.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chief of Space Operations
to brief the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed-
upon date, but not later than March 31, 2026, on the extent to
which professional military education for Space Force Guardians
addresses the elements of ‘‘Space Warfighting: A Framework for
Planners.’’
Further, the committee directs that the briefing shall assess the
feasibility and advisability of establishing a dedicated Center for
Orbital Warfare as part of achieving space superiority within the
context of the Framework document. This assessment shall detail:
(1) The benefits to the United States and our allies and partners
of advancing the knowledge of matters relating to orbital warfare,
including cybersecurity, electronic warfare, astro-geography,
sustainment, maneuver, tactically responsive space systems, and
emerging technology; (2) All relevant policy guidance from the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Defense; (3) Appropriate liaison relation-
ships with the geographic and functional combatant commands,
other Department of Defense stakeholders, and other government

and nongovernment entities and organizations; (4) An estimate of
the operational costs of such a center; (5) Potential partnership op-
portunities with U.S. allies and partners for collaboration and bur-
den sharing; and (6) Whether such a center would require legisla-
tion to be established.
Briefing on U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion plant trainer
The committee believes that there may be utility in the fielding
of a full-scale, immersive, hands-on nuclear propulsion plant simu-
lator to instruct officers and enlisted sailors in the operation and
maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants at the Navy’s Nu-
clear Power Training Unit. The committee further believes that
such a simulator could augment existing training methods, poten-
tially making training more flexible and less expensive for the
Navy.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1) The feasibility of fielding
a full-scale nuclear propulsion plant simulator; (2) The ways in
which such a simulator could augment existing training methods;
(3) Any cost savings associated with such a simulator; and (4) In-
dustry capabilities to develop a simulator.
Commercial ground stations
The committee encourages the Department of Defense to execute
efforts to enhance resilience and redundancy in military satellite
communications (MILSATCOM).
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense,
through the Enterprise Satellite Communication Management and
Control group, to assess how commercial ground-segment capabili-
ties can be integrated into existing MILSATCOM infrastructure
and to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the assessment. The briefing
should include strategies for commercial ground-segment integra-
tion that: (1) Leverage existing commercial ground infrastructure
for rapid offloading of MILSATCOM traffic, increasing resilience,
reducing vulnerability, and lowering operational costs; (2) Use
digitized and virtualized satellite communication management ar-
chitectures, employing modular, low-impact standards to enable
rapid waveform upgrades and network reconfigurations to main-
tain interoperability; and (3) Establish centralized management
procedures and security requirements, allowing commercial pro-
viders to deliver compliant services aligned with operational needs
and warfighter objectives.
Commercial Satellite Bus Integration
The committee recognizes the growing threat posed by adversary
counterspace capabilities, particularly those developed and de-
ployed by China and Russia. In response, the U.S. Space Force is
pursuing resilient and proliferated space architectures. However,
the committee is concerned that current acquisition strategies are
not fully leveraging the domestic commercial industrial base, which
is capable of producing configurable, commoditized satellite buses
at scale. These commercially available solutions have the potential

to reduce program cost and schedule risk by eliminating govern-
ment-funded, non-recurring engineering efforts, while also enabling
faster and more agile deployment of space assets.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of the
Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration to provide a brief-
ing to the congressional defense committees, not later than May 1,
2026, on the Department of the Air Force’s plans to incentivize and
increase the acquisition of domestically produced, configurable sat-
ellite buses in current and future proliferated satellite architec-
tures. The briefing shall include: (1) An analysis of the benefits and
challenges of identifying domestically produced, configurable sat-
ellite buses as a weighted source selection criterion in proliferated
space architecture acquisition programs; (2) A prioritized list of
mission areas suitable for proliferated satellite architectures and
an assessment of industrial base capacity to support these require-
ments; and (3) An evaluation of current acquisition policies, au-
thorities, and practices that incentivize the reduction of non-recur-
ring engineering costs to the Department of the Air Force for sat-
ellite bus modification within proliferated space architectures.
Commercial space domain awareness
The committee is aware that, according to the Department of De-
fense’s (DOD) annual report to the Congress on China’s military
and security developments, China launched over 200 satellites in
2023 alone. More than 360 Chinese satellites are believed to sup-
port intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.
Although Russia’s growth in space-based ISR is not as rapid, it re-
mains a significant concern. As the space domain becomes increas-
ingly contested, the committee underscores the strategic impor-
tance of leveraging commercial space-based and ground-based ob-
servation systems to enhance the DOD’s monitoring and assess-
ment capabilities.
Commercial space capabilities offer rapid innovation, lower costs,
and scalable access to persistent data that can augment DOD ef-
forts to detect, track, and characterize foreign ISR assets. By using
commercial observation platforms to the maximum extent prac-
ticable, the committee believes the Department can reduce reliance
on limited government-owned resources and improve resilience
across its space domain awareness architecture.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later
than March 31, 2026. The briefing shall include: (1) An assessment
of current and projected Chinese and Russian space-based ISR ca-
pabilities; (2) An overview of DOD monitoring efforts, including the
current and planned use of commercial systems; and (3) Rec-
ommendations for expanding the Department’s integration of com-
mercial capabilities to enhance space domain awareness, ISR detec-
tion, tracking, and mitigation strategies.
Comptroller General assessment of coordination with allies
on national security space acquisitions
The committee notes that the Department of Defense spends bil-
lions of dollars per year developing and procuring national security
space programs. The committee further notes that these programs

serve warfighters in a large variety of ways, including providing
protected communications, missile warning and tracking data, and
enabling battlespace awareness. In many areas of the national se-
curity space, the Department has close working relationships with
allies, and it shares information and resources in some cases. The
Department also has multiple strategies and policies that empha-
size the importance of relationships with allies and coordination
with them on space activities. In the past, the Department has had
allies as financial partners in developing space programs, which
served to decrease development costs for the Department, among
other benefits. The committee notes, however, this type of partner-
ship is not common.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The extent to which the Department
is partnering with allies on acquisitions of national security space
capabilities; (2) How the Department identifies and assesses oppor-
tunities for these partnerships, including any cost sharing agree-
ments; and (3) The risks and benefits of these partnerships.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General assessment of Department of Defense
program protection for space acquisition programs
The committee notes that the Department of Defense has estab-
lished various program protection-related policies and processes to
ensure that the Department is developing or acquiring systems
which are protected from cyber, physical, and other threats. The
committee further notes that the importance of these measures
cannot be overstated. Considering a dynamic threat environment,
the accelerating rate of technological change, and the increasing
importance of the space domain, the committee is concerned about
the ability of program offices to address dynamic threats effec-
tively.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The Department’s policies and proc-
esses, such as for the development and execution of program pro-
tection plans, which address protective measures to address cyber,
physical, and other threats for space systems being developed or
acquired; (2) How space system acquisition program offices
prioritize implementation of program protective measures versus
cost and schedule; and (3) The extent to which the most current
data and intelligence is used by program offices to inform program
protection planning and execution decisions.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives at a mutually agreed upon date, not later
than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a mutually agreed
upon format and timeframe. The committee further directs the
Comptroller General to advise the committee of any identified bar-

Comptroller General review of electromagnetic spectrum
needs during defense acquisition process
The committee notes that the electromagnetic radio frequency
spectrum is critical to the development and operation of a variety
of military systems such as radios, radars, and satellites. The com-
mittee understands that due to the changing nature of warfighting,
more and more military systems depend on spectrum to detect and
identify threats using advanced technologies, guide precision weap-
ons, and obtain information superiority. At the same time, the com-
mittee notes that demand for spectrum has increased with ad-
vances in commercial technology. This demand has led to competi-
tion between government and nongovernment users, making spec-
trum management vital to prevent harmful interference and to pro-
mote spectrum efficiency. The Department of Defense (DOD) has
policy and guidance documents that require the DOD to consider
spectrum needs during the acquisition lifecycle.
The committee notes that, in 2003, the Government Account-
ability Office found that DOD weapon programs often failed to ob-
tain, consider, or act upon adequate spectrum supportability knowl-
edge during the early stages of acquisition (‘‘Spectrum Manage-
ment in Defense Acquisitions’’, April 30, 2003, GAO–03–617R). The
committee is concerned that if the DOD is not intentionally and ac-
tively managing spectrum needs early in the acquisition lifecycle,
subsequent modifications could be excessively costly and could have
operational impacts, since those systems could remain in the
DOD’s arsenal for decades, when spectrum is expected to become
even more contested and congested than it is today.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) Whether other Executive Branch agen-
cies are providing sufficient guidance and information to the DOD
so that it has the necessary information to make spectrum manage-
ment decisions early in the acquisition lifecycle; (2) Whether the
DOD is implementing its spectrum management policy and guid-
ance documents; (3) Whether the DOD has a process to obtain, con-
sider, and act upon adequate spectrum supportability knowledge
during the early stages of an acquisition; and (4) Any other matters
the Comptroller General determines to be relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to the
congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon date,
not later than April 1, 2026, with final report to follow in a mutu-
ally agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of electromagnetic spectrum
operations
The committee notes that, in October 2020, the Department of
Defense (DOD) issued its Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) Superi-
ority Strategy to align EMS resources, capabilities, and activities
across the Department to support core national security objectives
while remaining mindful of the importance of U.S. economic pros-
perity. The committee further notes that the National Defense Au-

thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) included
a provision that required the Secretary of Defense, in coordination
with the Chief Information Officer, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of each of the military depart-
ments, to submit to the congressional defense committees an an-
nual report on the EMS Superiority Strategy of the Department.
However, the Government Accountability Office has previously re-
ported and testified that Department has not implemented its two
prior spectrum strategies (‘‘Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations:
DOD Needs to Address Governance and Oversight Issues to Help
Ensure Superiority,’’ December 10, 2020, GAO–21–64), despite rec-
ognition that near-peer countries were developing capabilities that
could undermine our national security.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller General of
the United States to assess: (1) The extent to which the DOD has
implemented its EMS Superiority Strategy; (2) Whether there are
accomplishments from the DOD’s implementation of the strategy;
(3) Whether the DOD has identified challenges in implementing
the strategy and, if so, taken steps to overcome the challenges; (4)
The extent to which the annual report complies with the require-
ments of section 502 of title 10, United States Code; and (5) Any
other matters the Comptroller General determines to be relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to the
congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon date,
not later than April 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a mutu-
ally agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of performance of the Logistics
Civil Augmentation Program contracting structure in
supporting U.S. Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll
The committee recognizes the importance of vital military assets
at Kwajalein Atoll and notes with concern the degraded state of
supporting assets and infrastructure critical to their operation.
Accordingly, to assist the committee in its oversight of these as-
sets, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the United
States to conduct a review and provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon time, not
later than March 1, 2026. The Comptroller General’s review should
assess: (1) The roles and responsibilities of U.S. Army Garrison
Kwajalein Atoll and its civilian contractors, including those man-
aged under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, in operating
and maintaining the supporting assets and infrastructure at the in-
stallation, to include power and cooling plants, stores, clinics, and
the garrison school; and (2) Department of Defense actions to ad-
dress challenges related to sustainment of key infrastructure on
Kwajalein Atoll.

Space Development Agency (SDA) plans to collect, integrate, and
disseminate data and products to the warfighter and broader com-
munity through its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture
(PWSA), which is predicated on an autonomous ground segment.
Accordingly, given the critical nature of this capability for na-
tional security and the DOD’s longstanding practice of launching
satellites before ground systems are fully operational, the com-
mittee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to as-
sess: (1) How the SDA is ensuring that the ground system will be
available to fully enable the proliferated and networked space-
based architecture; (2) The extent to which SDA is integrating,
processing, and disseminating the data that supports resilient mis-
sile warning and missile tracking; and (3) The extent to which the
SDA’s acquisitions address the needs of the warfighter and broader
community, including emerging needs in response to changing
threats.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
The committee further directs the DOD to provide the Comp-
troller General full access to any relevant information for this re-
view and directs the Comptroller General to advise the committee
of any identified barrier in conducting this work.
Comptroller General review of Space Fence program chal-
lenges
The committee notes the Space Fence ground-based radar was
developed to support the Space Force’s mission of tracking and cat-
aloging objects in multiple orbits. Space Fence was intended to
greatly enhance Space Force’s ability to identify and track smaller
objects on orbit and has greatly increased the amount of space situ-
ational awareness data available to the Department of Defense.
The committee further notes that during testing and in operations,
Space Fence experienced significant issues with the performance of
its hardware due to contamination of the water source used to cool
the radar. These issues threaten to shut down the radar, which
cost over $1.0 billion to develop.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess the extent to which DOD has identified and
addressed infrastructure and sustainment challenges that may be
inhibiting Space Fence readiness, including potential cost implica-
tions.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on its find-
ings at a mutually agreed upon date, not later than May 1, 2026.
Comptroller General review of space systems data net-
working capabilities

sion needs throughout the Department. To support the increasing
complexity of these space capabilities, the Department is devel-
oping various networking capabilities. The committee believes,
however, it is unclear whether networking efforts are sufficiently
synchronized with the development of space-based systems for this
new and dynamic environment.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) Steps the Department is taking to de-
velop the necessary infrastructure, hardware, and software to sup-
port networking requirements across various space-based legacy
systems and systems currently in development; and (2) The extent
to which the Department coordinates across various systems to en-
sure their resiliency and interoperability with respect to, among
other things, network architecture and protocols.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
The committee believes that in order to facilitate the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s (GAO) efforts, it is necessary to ensure
timely access to program information including but not limited to
cost, schedule, and budget information, program management re-
ports, and risk and technology readiness assessments. Given the
classified nature of some of the information, GAO is directed to ad-
vise the committee of any assistance GAO personnel will need to
secure access to information related to this review.
Cybersecurity for space assets
The committee notes that the cybersecurity of the control net-
work for satellite operations is of paramount importance, given the
attack vectors associated with the number of ground stations and
satellite apertures.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to brief the congressional defense committees, not later than March
31, 2026, on the cybersecurity of the Air Force Satellite Control
Network (AFSCN). In particular, the briefing should evaluate prin-
cipal locations, such as Schriever Space Force Base, locations in the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area of responsibility, and other such
sites as appropriate. The briefing should assess: (1) Recent cyber
stress testing of the network to assess its effectiveness and resil-
ience; (2) The presence and effectiveness of cyber event detection
capabilities in both information and operational technologies sup-
porting AFSCN operations; (3) The capability of forces assigned to
AFSCN facilities to respond to and recover from cyber attacks on
critical information and operational technologies; (4) The ability of
defensive cyber forces under U.S. Cyber Command to provide time-
ly and expert information technology and operational technology
defensive operations to ensure the wartime functionality of AFSCN
sites; (5) The level of support required from civilian and contractor
entities responsible for defending critical cyber assets; and (6) The
recovery processes needed to ensure the AFSCN can function and
support contingency operations.

feasibility and advisability of a lessons learned repository for both
peacetime and wartime cyber stress testing exercises.
Demonstrate leveraging commercial in-space data pur-
chases and analysis for unresolved imagery for Space
Domain Awareness
The committee recognizes the growing importance of leveraging
commercial capabilities to enhance national security in space. To
that end, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force, not
later than March 31, 2026, to brief the congressional defense com-
mittees on the feasibility and advisability of a study on using
ground-based and in-space commercial data and analytics to cap-
ture and exploit unresolved imagery collected by existing assets in
geostationary orbit (GEO). The study would demonstrate how com-
mercial data and analytics can be used to realize the value of unre-
solved imagery in GEO to increase space situational awareness and
defense capabilities. Results from this initial study would be used
in a demonstration mission where the unresolved commercial data
is leveraged to tip and cue Space Domain Awareness satellites, an
efficient and cost-effective solution to ensure greater early warning
of adversary space activities that could eventually expand to utilize
additional in-space sensors for observation and data collection as
the satellites’ secondary mission set.
Directed energy weapons
The committee is concerned about the Department of Defense’s
continued unwillingness to adequately invest in directed energy
weapons and its apparent lack of commitment to effectively ad-
vancing these technologies. The committee has received consistent
testimony regarding the potential value that directed energy weap-
ons have in supplementing integrated air and missile defenses. The
committee has further received testimony regarding the imbalances
in air warfare in terms of budget and inventory, and it is clear the
United States does not have sufficient inventory or budget to be
able to engage salvos of missiles and unmanned systems solely
with kinetic interceptors. The committee notes that the fiscal year
2026 budget from the Department lacks the clarity in resources
and planning to meet the needs in integrated air and missile de-
fense. The committee strongly encourages the Department to con-
sider the benefits of directed energy systems as part of the admin-
istration’s Golden Dome plans and in developing integrated air and
missile defense weapons and platforms.
The committee further directs the Under Secretary of Defense for
Research & Engineering, in coordination with the Direct Reporting
Program Manager for Golden Dome for America and the Director
of the Missile Defense Agency, to provide the congressional defense
committees with a briefing, not later than December 1, 2025, on a
strategy for comprehensively expanding the Department’s invest-
ments in the development of directed energy weapons over the next
Future Years Defense Program.

Dynamic robotic servicing in space
The committee notes that the development of robotic systems in
space for servicing or refueling satellites is of key importance for
the longevity of space systems. Potential applications of robotic sys-
tems include: (1) Disposing of derelict satellites to prevent colli-
sions that generate space debris; (2) Upgrading satellites in situ,
instead of replacing them, to save taxpayer dollars; (3) Refueling
satellites so they can stay in orbit; and (4) Returning science pay-
loads or manufactured goods to Earth by robotically retrieving and
berthing them in a reentry system vehicle.
The committee believes that, at present, the satellite servicing
industry is nascent. There are no widely accepted standards for re-
fueling or docking interfaces, and there have been few demonstra-
tions of such interfaces in space. Of note, China has already dem-
onstrated a robotic spacecraft to tug satellites into graveyard orbits
approximately 300 kilometers past geostationary orbit. The com-
mittee also notes with concern that Chinese investment in in-space
robotics currently outstrips that of the United States.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the feasibility of utilizing
existing Department of Defense expertise in space robotics to deter-
mine whether using a robotic system can capture the Vanguard-1
spacecraft and return it to Earth for display.
The committee notes that Vanguard-1 is the oldest manmade ob-
ject in orbit and constitutes a historically and scientifically valu-
able object. Developing the ability to robotically grapple and manip-
ulate objects in space and return them to Earth would be a high-
profile demonstration of the United States’ scientific expertise and
would help lay the groundwork for routine manufacturing of medi-
cines, industrial crystalline materials, and other valuable materials
in microgravity. The committee believes that executing such a mis-
sion would advance a multitude of technologies that could benefit
the U.S. industrial base in a variety of mission areas.
Electromagnetic warfare and spectrum operations man-
power
The committee notes there has been increased attention to elec-
tromagnetic warfare and spectrum operations (EMSO) as a result
of great power competition. The committee further notes that the
Joint Staff has created a Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Oper-
ations Center to drive spectrum operations planning cells at each
of the combatant commands. Furthermore, section 1091 of the
James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) requires that any tier one exercise
by a combatant command incorporate EMSO planning and that
EMSO is codified as a Joint Force mission in chapter 25 of title 10,
United State Code.
In response to the increasing importance of this domain of war-
fare, the U.S. Air Force has increased its emphasis on EMSO, first
by establishing the 350th Spectrum Operations Wing in 2021 and
then, in December 2023, establishing EMSO doctrine (‘‘Electro-
magnetic Spectrum Operations,’’ Air Force Doctrine Publication 3–
85). However, the committee understands that the U.S. Air Force

has yet to undertake a holistic review of a career field for personnel
planning that integrates EMSO into fully developed doctrine, orga-
nization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel,
and facilities.
Accordingly, not later than February 28, 2026, the committee di-
rects the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a one-time report to
the congressional defense committees with a long-term plan to es-
tablish a career field in EMSO for both air and space operations.
The plan should inventory all career fields within the U.S. Air and
Space Forces performing the EMSO mission set and develop a
strategy to integrate, manage, and train airmen and guardians,
both enlisted and officer, on EMSO.
Electronic warfare requirements and testing for Group 1–3
unmanned aerial systems and loitering munitions
The committee is concerned by the Department of Defense’s cur-
rent posture regarding the survivability and operational effective-
ness of Group 1 through Group 3 unmanned aerial systems (UAS)
and loitering munitions in contested electromagnetic environments.
In particular, the committee notes the demonstrated effectiveness
of Russian electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, including Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Radio Frequency (RF) jamming,
against U.S.-supplied Group 1–3 UAS and loitering munitions oper-
ating in Ukraine. These adversary electronic warfare threats high-
light critical vulnerabilities in current Department-fielded systems
and underscore the necessity of resilient UAS platforms capable of
executing mission requirements in RF- and GPS-denied environ-
ments.
The committee is further concerned that the Department has not
established a consistent baseline for operational performance in
contested EW environments for Group 1–3 UAS and loitering mu-
nitions. In addition, there appears to be an absence of a systematic
process for incorporating emerging EW threat intelligence into re-
quirements development, system design, or testing protocols. The
committee believes that the Department must implement a live,
virtual, and constructive test and evaluation regime that ade-
quately reflects the evolving EW threat landscape and that informs
the requirements and procurement decisions for these systems.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than December 31,
2025, on the Department’s current capabilities, requirements, and
testing standards to ensure the effective employment of Group 1–
3 UAS and loitering munitions in contested EW environments. The
briefing shall include the following: (1) A description of any existing
Department or military service requirements related to Group 1–
3 UAS and loitering munitions operations in RF- and GPS-denied
environments; (2) Minimum performance standards or required ca-
pabilities for these systems in such environments; (3) A list and de-
scription of any assessment mechanisms used to evaluate adver-
sary RF- and GPS-jamming capabilities, and how these assess-
ments are integrated into UAS and loitering munitions require-
ments development and acquisition processes; and (4) An overview
of the live, virtual, and constructive EW testing regimes for Group

1–3 UAS and loitering munitions, including how these testing ef-
forts incorporate the threat assessments referenced above and in-
form capability requirements.
The committee expects this briefing to inform future oversight of
DOD’s investments in tactical UAS and loitering munition capabili-
ties and their survivability in modern conflict environments.
Encouraging investment in deep space telescopes
The committee notes that radio telescopes such as the National
Radio Astronomy Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Tel-
escope provide unique capabilities for deep space situational aware-
ness. The committee believes these federally funded radio tele-
scopes and data acquisition systems provide key navigation and
tracking information and that these are unique national security
applications utilized by the Department of Defense.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Department to invest
in the design and planning of important new updates to these tele-
scopes such as the Next-Generation VLA and the Green Bank Tele-
scope system.
Extended life operations for U.S. Government satellites
The committee understands that end-of-life satellites are dis-
posed of every year as they are replaced with newer satellite con-
stellations. These end-of-life satellites may have significant mission
utility to support operations and training but are being disposed of
due to insufficient funding and staffing to operate the new and the
older constellations simultaneously. The committee further under-
stands that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s Polar Operational Environmental Satellites and the Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency’s Blackjack constellations both
currently operate a commercial model of operating Government sat-
ellites as a service.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
not later than March 31, 2026, to provide a briefing that: (1) As-
sesses how many satellites are disposed of annually; and (2) Com-
pares the costs and benefits of continuing to extract mission value
from older satellites by operating the satellites by a commercial en-
tity versus disposing of these satellites.
High-resolution three-dimensional geospatial data
The committee recognizes the importance of unclassified,
shareable high-resolution three-dimensional (HR3D) geospatial
data in support of Department of Defense operations, activities by
other elements of the U.S. Government, and international partners.
The committee understands that the Army Geospatial Center’s
HR3D program has successfully mapped over 4.3 million square
kilometers globally across more than 45 countries, providing essen-
tial geospatial information that enhances force positioning, mission
planning, and coalition effectiveness in key operational theaters.
The committee notes with concern that despite the abundance of
unclassified geospatial data in existence, there lacks a single custo-
dian based on geography, service, or agency. Additionally, geo-
graphic combatant commanders currently maintain separate proc-
esses for collecting geospatial data with a disproportionate empha-

sis on classified collection, which can result in inefficiencies and
missed opportunities in shaping operations in Phase 0 or Phase 1
operating environments. The committee emphasizes that shareable
HR3D data provides a foundation on which other data sources can
be layered and is uniquely positioned to support the changing secu-
rity environment with greater emphasis on operations in the com-
petitive space, including Phase 0 and Phase 1 operations.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit a report, not later than May 31, 2026, to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
that includes, at a minimum, the following: (1) A description of any
plans to sustain and expand the existing shareable HR3D program
capabilities, with particular emphasis on the Army Geospatial Cen-
ter’s BuckEye program, including a description of resourcing re-
quirements, organizational responsibilities, and anticipated
timelines for any such plan; (2) An assessment of the anticipated
benefits of implementing a Global Foundation Layer (GFL) require-
ments generation process and organizational structure to coordi-
nate geospatial data collection, integration, and dissemination
across each geographic combatant command, service, and agency;
(3) An assessment of opportunities to combine shareable HR3D
data with other unclassified data sets to enable blended analysis
and production; and (4) Any other matters deemed relevant by the
Secretary.
Integrated sensing roadmap for unidentified anomalous
phenomena
The committee notes the scientific and technical challenges in in-
vestigating, identifying, and validating unidentified anomalous
phenomena (UAP). Aside from the credibility gaps that exist in
some communities following this issue, there is a significant tech-
nical challenge to trying to collect necessary scientific and signa-
ture data for something that is inherently unknown and might ap-
pear unpredictably in location and time. To date, investigations
have relied primarily on eyewitness accounts or from sympathetic
sensors of various types that may have happened to be collecting
at the right time and place to capture evidence of some unknown
phenomena.
The committee is aware that the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution
Office (AARO) was established to investigate UAPs and to try to
develop definitive scientific evidence to help resolve these unknown
cases. The committee is also aware that the AARO has been invest-
ing in a set of sensors focused on airborne UAPs, but, as noted in
its annual report to Congress, gaps still exist in the sensing of
space, maritime surface, and maritime subsurface domains. Addi-
tionally, the ability to correlate data from these domains into a sin-
gle picture for analysis by the AARO does not currently exist.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the AARO to de-
velop an integrated sensing roadmap and to provide a briefing to
the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than August 1,

Section 30:
2026. Such roadmap should include the following: (1) A framework
for sensing needs and gaps for space, maritime surface, and mari-
time subsurface domains; (2) An assessment of available sensors
for each of those domains; (3) Challenges to developing an inte-

grated picture across those domains; (4) The ability to integrate
sympathetic collection of other sensors available during data collec-
tion events; and (5) An assessment of resources needed to address
any gaps or challenges identified by the roadmap.
Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor acquisition
The committee strongly supports accelerated integrated air and
missile defense (IAMD) modernization but understands that the
Army has not committed to supporting any partner procurement of
the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) system
unless there is parallel procurement of the Integrated Battle Com-
mand System.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the following subjects: (1)
Potential adjustments to the LTAMDS acquisition strategy, includ-
ing advance procurement of up to three battalions of radars per
year and the use of multi-year procurement to achieve a higher an-
nual production rate; (2) Possible annual savings associated with
bundling partner procurement of LTAMDS over the period of the
multi-year; and (3) An operational summary of how procurement of
LTAMDS at full rate to meet global demand would enhance IAMD
in the U.S. European, Central, and Indo-Pacific Commands’ areas
of responsibility.
Modernizing mission assurance for space launch
The committee reaffirms the importance of robust mission assur-
ance requirements for national security space launches. Histori-
cally, these requirements have been shaped by factors such as lim-
ited order quantities, demanding orbital parameters, complex cus-
tom integration needs, and the sensitive nature of national security
missions. However, this one-size-fits-all approach, often costly and
burdensome, has been uniformly applied across all national secu-
rity launches, despite the existence of multiple launch programs
that are designed with varying risk profiles aligned to specific mis-
sion objectives.
While the National Security Space Launch program has made
progress under Phase 3 to adopt more tailored, modern mission as-
surance standards in line with current industry practices, other
programs, such as the Orbital Services Program and the Sounding
Rocket Program, continue to operate under outdated and unneces-
sarily rigid frameworks. The committee believes that these pro-
grams play critical roles in supporting military capabilities and
would significantly benefit from a more flexible, agile mission as-
surance structure that reflects their distinct operational purposes.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Chief of Space Operations
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than September
30, 2025, detailing how the Space Force will modernize mission as-
surance requirements across its launch programs. This moderniza-
tion plan must include: (1) A specific timeline, responsible offices,
and measurable milestones for implementing modernized mission
assurance requirements for experimental, test, prototype, and oper-
ational payloads in all Assured Access to Space launch programs,

including the Orbital Services Program and Sounding Rocket Pro-
gram; and (2) A process for updating mission assurance require-
ments on a regular basis as launch cadence increases and more
launch providers are onboarded into Space Force managed launch
contracts.
Multi-use commercial communications for deep space mis-
sions
The committee strongly supports operationally relevant capabili-
ties and infrastructure for secure command and control and posi-
tion, navigation, and timing throughout cislunar space and encour-
ages the Secretary of the Air Force to increase investments in this
area. Further, the committee encourages the Secretary to develop
a coordinated program for commercial cislunar and deep space com-
munications services to augment the existing National Aeronautics
and Space Administration’s Deep Space Network and to meet U.S.
Government requirements for commercial, civil, and national secu-
rity space missions. The program should maximize commercial
models, such as public-private partnerships, to leverage innovative
technologies and approaches to reduce the costs and development
schedules of traditional deep space communication systems.
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
The committee believes the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency’s (NGA) Maven Program is critical to the United States’
ability to provide state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) capabili-
ties including, but not limited to, the current computer vision and
generative AI efforts. Such capabilities are important for rapidly
detecting, identifying, characterizing, extracting, and attributing
features and objects in imagery and video data sets at the speed
of crisis and conflict.
The committee urges the Director of the NGA to ensure that the
Maven Program continues to: (1) Operate with agility and speed;
(2) Support a competitive development and collaboration method-
ology; (3) Structure as open architecture with both platform and
enterprise engineering infrastructure across U.S. Government na-
tional security systems and classification domains; (4) Enable open
and fair participation from the entire national defense industrial
base; and (5) Ensure operational continuity from the strategic to
the tactical levels.
Further, the committee believes flexible, adaptive contracts could
enable the Maven Program to rapidly execute AI research and de-
velopment and adapt to changes in the global threat environment.
The committee further believes the Maven Program should con-
tinue its focus on sourcing from the best and brightest companies
from the national defense industrial base, regardless of size and
maturity, which would increase competition and provide the best
products and services to the Department of Defense.
Non-propulsive orbital maneuvering technologies
The committee supports continued development of maneuver
technologies that reduce reliance on consumable propulsion. As the
Department of Defense expands activity in low earth orbit (LEO)
and plans for cislunar operations, it must pursue mobility solutions

that avoid burdensome fuel logistics and enhance survivability.
Electromechanical deployment platforms offer energy-efficient ways
to reposition space assets for key space superiority missions while
improving endurance and enabling new economic benefits in the
space domain.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in coordination with the Chief of Space Operations and the Director
of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to submit a re-
port to the congressional defense committees, not later than March
1, 2026, assessing the feasibility, utility, integration potential, and
barriers to operational use of non-propulsive maneuver tech-
nologies. A classified annex may be included.
Ongoing Comptroller General review of Minuteman III
intercontinental ballistic missile operations and
sustainment
The committee notes that in 2021, the Air Force reported that
the Department of Defense (DOD) planned to retire the Minuteman
III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system when the re-
placement system, Sentinel, reached full operational capability in

Section 31:
2036. However, in early 2024, the committee notes that the DOD
reported that the Sentinel program had experienced a Nunn-
McCurdy breach triggered by critical cost overruns. The program
also faces significant schedule delays that will likely require the
Air Force to continue operating the Minuteman III system far
longer than planned. Consequently, the committee is concerned
about the Air Force’s ability to sustain the aging Minuteman III
system through the transition to Sentinel. In May 2025, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) completed a review of current
preparations to transition from Minuteman III to Sentinel and
made recommendations to use the time provided by the delay to in-
crease the Air Force’s focus on risks (‘‘ICBM Modernization: Air
Force Actions Needed to Expeditiously Address Critical Risks to
Sentinel Transition’’ (GAO–25–107048C, May 13, 2025)). Over the
past several years, GAO’s regular reviews of the Sentinel program
have been essential to congressional oversight of this program.
Therefore, to ensure that the committee continues to receive in-
formation on the Minuteman III program and the transition to
Sentinel, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct regular reviews of the operations and
sustainment of the Minuteman III ICBM program through fiscal
year 2030 and to brief the congressional defense committees on a
periodic, mutually agreed upon basis.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to issue
written assessments to the congressional defense committees based
on its regular reviews, as needed by the committees, in formats and
at times to be mutually agreed upon, through fiscal year 2030.
Performance review of security clearance process
The committee is aware that the Department of Defense (DOD)
continues to struggle with a backlog in security clearance investiga-
tions and adjudications that hinders industry, increases risk to the
Department, and generally slows down the ability of the Depart-
ment to onboard personnel working on important tasks for the De-

partment. There are many factors compounding delays, but the
committee believes a comprehensive business process review using
lean six sigma or similar techniques would provide helpful insight
into root causes for these delays. Additionally, the committee be-
lieves an outside review by an entity with experience in these tech-
niques, but not steeped in the business processes or culture of the
security process, could provide fresh perspectives on problems and
possible solutions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Department of Defense Per-
formance Improvement Officer to conduct a review of the DOD se-
curity clearance process and provide a briefing on the results of
that review to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than October 1, 2026.
The review should be focused on finding opportunities to improve
processing timeliness, data to help measure the progress and effec-
tiveness of the program, and reciprocity between defense organiza-
tions. Elements of the review shall focus specifically on examining
data related to: (1) Reciprocity within DOD components and the
interagency; (2) Timelines for security process steps, including de-
veloping a metric for timeliness; and (3) Interoperability of all of
the related systems of record related to security clearance proc-
essing.
Protection and advancement of electronic warfare systems
The committee strongly supports continued growth of the Army
Research Laboratory collaboration with academia in the develop-
ment of technologies that harden and increase the resilience of
electronic warfare systems. The committee further supports
leveraging advancements in directed energy effects, coupled with
electronic warfare approaches, to ensure mission success in a con-
tested, congested battlefield environment. The committee notes
that this is consistent with the Secretary of Defense Memorandum
on Army Transformation and Acquisition Reform, dated April 30,
2025, to achieve electromagnetic and air-littoral dominance by

Section 32:
2027.
Public-private partnerships in nuclear effects testing
The committee notes that the ongoing nuclear modernization ef-
fort, combined with an expansion of our missile defense capability,
has increased the need to modernize our nuclear effects testing ca-
pability, which has been slow to keep pace. The committee further
notes that most facilities that provide this capability were designed
in the 1980s and need a technical refresh. Furthermore, many of
the facilities are in high demand, with long waiting queues for
component- and system-level testing. In addition, the industrial
base for this field of technology has shrunk considerably.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Department of Defense’s
Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, in coordination with
the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Administrator for
Nuclear Security, to provide a one-time briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the
following subjects: (1) Any current gaps in radiation effects testing
capacity and any delays in weapon system testing resulting from
a lack of capacity; (2) The status of existing collaboration efforts

with industry on nuclear effects testing; (3) An analysis of the fea-
sibility of establishing a public-private partnership for nuclear ef-
fects testing; and (4) Any other relevant issues the Director or the
Administrator deems necessary.
Satellite hyperspectral imaging
The committee notes that hyperspectral imaging is an advanced
technique that captures and analyzes data across the electro-
magnetic spectrum, enabling the identification of objects and mate-
rials based on their unique spectral signatures at the pixel level.
The committee believes that commercial deployment of this tech-
nology in space holds significant promise to reduce costs to the
Government and expand accessibility through broader adoption
and use.
Therefore, not later than March 31, 2026, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence,
in coordination with the Directors of the National Geospatial-Intel-
ligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office, to brief the
congressional defense and intelligence committees regarding an as-
sessment of the gaps that could be filled by hyperspectral imagery
capabilities. The briefing should also address how commercial
hyperspectral imagery capabilities could contribute to addressing
existing and future defense and intelligence gaps.
Sea-based launch platforms for ballistic missile defense tar-
gets
The committee recognizes the importance of threat-representa-
tive testing capabilities for ballistic missile defense systems, as
well as challenges inherent to accurately simulating ballistic mis-
sile threats. In particular, the committee is concerned that mission
oversaturation at Cape Canaveral may limit the Navy’s ability to
fully test and evaluate different missiles, including Trident mis-
siles, given the growing space launch cadence and the likely in-
crease in missile defense testing as the Golden Dome project pro-
ceeds. The committee is encouraged by efforts to reconstitute sea-
based launch platforms for ballistic missile targets and encourages
the Secretary of the Navy to prioritize the deployment of such plat-
forms.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary, in coordination
with the Secretary of the Air Force and the Director of the Missile
Defense Agency, to provide a one-time brief to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than November 1, 2025, on the viability
of expanding the number of locations available for the Navy’s
launch and test capabilities, including through the use of maritime
spaceports as supplementary launch options.
Space access, mobility, and logistics
The committee remains concerned about increasing threats in
space as adversaries continue to develop and deploy advanced capa-
bilities to hold at risk, degrade, and destroy U.S. and allied na-
tional security space assets. In this new threat environment, estab-
lishing and sustaining freedom of maneuver and operations in tra-
ditional orbits and in cislunar space for dynamic space operations
in peacetime, crisis, or conflict requires an effective space logistics

architecture and enterprise. For this reason, the committee con-
tinues to support Servicing, Mobility, and Logistics (SML) pro-
grams to meet U.S. Space Command’s (SPACECOM) need for sus-
tained space maneuver in the near-term.
The 2022 U.S. Space Force Operations Doctrine for Space Forces
notes that SML to enable movement and support of military equip-
ment and personnel into, within, and from space ‘‘is integral to de-
livering freedom of action and independent options to the joint
force.’’ The U.S. Space Force has established increasingly capable
and competitive access into space.
However, to date, the U.S. Space Force currently lacks oper-
ational, space-resident assets capable of maneuvering relevant dis-
tances consistent with the 2022 doctrine. Also lacking is a logistics
enterprise for mobility throughout the space domain and for sus-
taining, redeploying, or reallocating forces in orbit. U.S. Space
Force and SPACECOM thus face logistical constraints for flexible,
cost-effective space access and on-orbit sustainment beyond low
earth orbit. The committee is aware that commercial providers are
currently developing novel SML capabilities. Developing and de-
ploying space-resident transportation and mobility capabilities, in-
cluding refuellable upper stages or refuellable orbital transfer vehi-
cles (OTVs) with high delta-v, would complement traditional
launch services to reduce the cost of satellite deployment to unique
or high-energy orbits, increase the flexibility of space asset deploy-
ment, and create resilient on-orbit response and sustainment capa-
bilities.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in coordination with SPACECOM, to provide a one-time briefing to
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than December 1, 2025, to assess: (1)
The operations and acquisition plans necessary for on-orbit logis-
tics, including for refuellable, high delta-v OTVs, to deliver space
assets to high-energy orbits and provide capabilities for on-orbit
repositioning; and (2) The advisability and feasibility of assuming
responsibility for the cancelled On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and
Manufacturing-1 spacecraft.
Space cooperation with allies and partners in Indo-Pacific
region
The committee believes that potential cooperation with allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, South Korea,
Australia, and India, is in our national security interest given the
growing space threat posed by China.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Space Policy and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Indo-Pacific Security Affairs to brief the congressional defense com-
mittees, not later than March 31, 2026, on efforts to coordinate
best practices in space with the governments of Japan, South
Korea, Australia, India, and other relevant allies and partners in
the Indo-Pacific region, including best practices on space situa-
tional awareness and space industrial policy and other matters of
mutual interest.

innovative acquisition model, which emphasizes rapid procurement,
scalability, and flexibility in addressing the growing demands for
space-based capabilities critical to national defense. The SDA’s ap-
proach has proven to be effective in reducing bureaucratic delays
and ensuring the rapid delivery of cutting-edge space systems to
the warfighter to keep pace with our adversaries. The committee
particularly applauds the SDA for defining requirements without
the lengthy processes typically associated with the Joint Capabili-
ties Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and for its use
of Other Transactions Agreements (OTA) that expedite traditional
contracting processes. Through its approach to requirements and
by utilizing OTAs, the SDA has demonstrated its ability to accel-
erate procurement timelines, bringing advanced technologies to the
field more efficiently than traditional acquisition methods allow.
To maintain the rapid delivery of space-based capabilities to the
warfighter, the committee supports the implementation of rec-
ommendations made in the February 26, 2025, report of the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) titled ‘‘Laser Communica-
tions: Space Development Agency Should Create Links Between
Development Phases’’ (GAO–25–106838). The committee encour-
ages the SDA to install an industry integrator for future tranches
of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture to ensure that
different vendors’ satellite optical communications terminals are
able to communicate with each other. The integration of these ca-
pabilities is critical for the rapid delivery of robust laser commu-
nications capabilities for missile warning and data transport. The
committee further encourages the SDA to use the full range of
available financial, contractual, and policy tools to maintain devel-
opment timelines and avoid increasing costs through the commer-
cial integration process.
The committee encourages continued investment in the SDA’s ac-
quisition approach, which balances the need for rapid acquisition
with the advantages of maintaining a competitive, multi-provider
landscape while considering the role of support contractors in the
rapid acquisition process. The committee further emphasizes the
importance of continued collaboration between the SDA, other enti-
ties of the Department of Defense, and the commercial space indus-
try to ensure that the United States remains the global leader in
space technology.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the SDA to pro-
vide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the following: (1) The SDA’s
progress toward implementing the recommendations made by GAO
in GAO–25–106838; (2) The range of financial, contractual, and
policy tools the SDA uses to ensure efficient acquisition and tech-
nology integration; and (3) The activities the SDA undertakes to
collaborate with the Department of Defense and the commercial
space industry.

Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking pro-
gram
The committee recognizes the intent behind the U.S. Space
Force’s Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking
(TacSRT) program to enhance operational support through com-
mercial data analytics. However, the committee is concerned that
TacSRT may be duplicative of existing intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities elsewhere in the Department
of Defense (DOD), including those executed by combatant com-
mands and agencies such as the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency.
Additionally, the committee is concerned that the program may
blur the lines between tactical ISR and intelligence functions tradi-
tionally subject to more robust oversight mechanisms, raising po-
tential implications for the delineation of roles and responsibilities,
required analytical rigor, and the proper classification and han-
dling of sensitive information.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Chief of Space Operations
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than January
25, 2026. The briefing shall include: (1) A description of TacSRT’s
current and planned capabilities and how they are distinct from or
coordinated with DoD ISR programs; (2) An explanation of the pro-
gram’s governance structure, including how oversight, data classi-
fication, and interagency coordination are managed; (3) An assess-
ment of the potential for duplication with existing programs and
how such duplication is being mitigated; (4) A review of how the
Space Force ensures that TacSRT does not encroach upon activities
traditionally subject to intelligence oversight; and (5) A summary
of any policy guidance or memoranda of understanding that govern
the use of commercial ISR in TacSRT operations.
Tactically Responsive Space
The committee notes the progress made on demonstrating
Tactically Responsive Space’s (TacRS) capabilities and its role in
securing our Nation’s interests in, from, and to space. The com-
mittee notes that TacRS is designed to challenge traditional as-
sumptions and processes by demonstrating the United States’ capa-
bility to rapidly acquire, launch, and operate a space vehicle on
operationally relevant timelines in order to respond to on-orbit
threats while also leveraging the innovation from commercial con-
tributions and private sector innovation. The committee believes
the Department of Defense should develop a strategic plan, includ-
ing the establishment of a program of record with the appropriate
funding and prioritization, to enable the warfighter to use this ca-
pability.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in consultation with the Chief of Space Operations, to provide a
brief to the congressional defense committees, not later than March
31, 2026, on TacRS. This briefing shall include, at a minimum, the
following items: (1) A plan detailing a 5-year roadmap for the de-
velopment, demonstration, integration, and funding of TacRS to in-
clude launch and space systems; (2) An evaluation of the current
industrial base for TacRS that could be used for TacRS, the Space

Development Agency, and space control missions; and (3) An eval-
uation of associated actions and milestones required to ensure suc-
cessful operational integration of TacRS for both on-orbit and
ground-based space systems.
Unified Data Library (UDL) integration and sensor data fu-
sion
The committee recognizes the critical role of data integration,
real-time sensor fusion, and decision support in enhancing national
defense operations. The committee notes that the Unified Data Li-
brary (UDL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in consolidating,
normalizing, and securely sharing diverse data streams to support
multi-domain awareness, threat detection, space situational aware-
ness, and health records across the Department of Defense. The
committee further notes the cost savings and operational effi-
ciencies realized through the UDL’s current implementation within
the U.S. Space Force and its increasing applicability to broader
joint and interagency missions.
Given the rising demand for data-driven decision-making across
combatant commands, the committee encourages the Department
of Defense to prioritize the integration of radar and sensor systems
within the UDL framework to enhance warfighter decision-making
in operationally relevant timelines. The ability to aggregate and
fuse data from space-based, airborne, and ground-based sensors
into a common operational picture will provide actionable informa-
tion to warfighters, enabling rapid and informed decision-making
across multiple domains. The UDL’s demonstrated ability to mobi-
lize data and rapidly connect disparate systems enables dramatic
cost savings across the enterprise and enables rapid operational
modernization across all domains not previously achieved.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the Department’s strategy for
enterprise-wide UDL adoption. This briefing should include rec-
ommendations for long-term governance, funding requirements, the
integration of radar and sensor data, and the potential for Office
of the Secretary of Defense sponsorship of the UDL to ensure its
availability across all military services and defense agencies as
needed.

TITLE XVI—CYBERSPACE RELATED MATTERS
Subtitle A—Matters Relating to Cyber Operations and Cyber
Forces
Sec. 1601—Comprehensive cyber workforce strategy
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, acting through the Department of Defense
(DOD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for Cyber Policy, to develop a comprehensive cyber
workforce strategy and submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than January 31, 2027. The provision directs the report
to include eleven specific elements.
The committee recognizes that the United States faces an un-
precedented and rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape that de-
mands a fundamentally transformed approach to cyber workforce
development and management within the DOD. The committee
notes with concern that current cyber talent acquisition and reten-
tion efforts have not kept pace with the sophistication and scale of
adversarial cyber capabilities, creating critical vulnerabilities in
national defense infrastructure and operations. The committee be-
lieves that this comprehensive strategy represents a vital step to-
ward addressing systemic workforce challenges that have hindered
the DOD’s ability to effectively counter state and non-state cyber
actors who continue to target critical defense systems and sensitive
information.
The committee also recognizes the increasing challenges faced by
the DOD in combating malicious cyber actors and the critical need
for collaboration with industry and academia to enhance the devel-
opment and throughput of highly skilled cybersecurity profes-
sionals through the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
program. The committee directs the DOD to evaluate the integra-
tion of programs to upskill the workforce, hosted and funded
through various academic institutions, into the activities and ef-
forts of the Cyber Academic Engagement Office under the DOD
CIO. The committee believes these programs are efficient solutions
to support the growth of small businesses within the defense indus-
trial base.
Sec. 1602—United States Cyber Command artificial intel-
ligence industry collaboration roadmap
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), in coordination
with senior Department of Defense (DOD) artificial intelligence and
research officials, to develop a roadmap for industry and academic
collaboration on artificial intelligence-enabled cyber capabilities for

cyberspace operations. The roadmap must address: (1) Collabo-
rative development lines of effort; (2) Industry engagement strate-
gies; (3) Contractual mechanisms; (4) Security clearance require-
ments; and (5) Organizational structure options, and be completed
by August 1, 2026. The Commander, CYBERCOM, shall provide a
briefing to the congressional defense committees on the roadmap,
courses of action, and selected approach by November 1, 2026, with
annual updates beginning with the fiscal year 2028 budget submis-
sion and continuing until 2030.
The committee recognizes that the rapidly evolving cyber domain
requires CYBERCOM to maintain close integration with entities
developing cutting-edge technologies, ensuring the Cyber Mission
Force possesses the most capable tools to hold adversaries at risk
and impose costs across the domain. The committee acknowledges
that while advanced technologies are being developed in national
laboratories and by Department of Defense research organizations
such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, industry
remains a critical partner in this endeavor. The committee is con-
cerned, however, with the current level of industry engagement
and collaboration on artificial intelligence-enabled cyber tools and
technologies. The committee notes that CYBERCOM possesses the
necessary budget and authorities to establish a robust program of
cooperative research, testing, and deployment of artificial intel-
ligence-enabled cyber tools, yet structured industry partnerships
remain underdeveloped. The committee believes that given the cur-
rent threat environment, there is an urgent need to accelerate
these collaborative relationships through a comprehensive roadmap
that maximizes the integration of commercial innovation with mili-
tary cyber capabilities.
Sec. 1603—Strategy for deterrence against cyberattacks
against defense critical infrastructure of the United
States
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to develop a strategy and courses of action to
create credible deterrence against cyberattacks on U.S. defense
critical infrastructure. The strategy must evaluate how to deter ad-
versary cyber actions and outline methods to impose costs on ad-
versaries targeting critical infrastructure. The provision also estab-
lishes requirements for an interim briefing and a final briefing to
the congressional defense committees on the strategy and courses
of action, not later than March 1, 2026, and June 1, 2026, respec-
tively.
The committee remains concerned that the current strategy to
deter attacks against defense critical infrastructure is not adequate
as evidenced by the activities of the Volt Typhoon and Salt Ty-
phoon persistent cyber actors. The committee believes that appro-
priate options to reestablish this deterrence and available response
options to detected activities is critical.

Sec. 1604—Amendment to annual assessments and reports
on assignment of certain budget control responsibility
to Commander of the United States Cyber Command
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1558 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) to include a require-
ment for a review of investments in artificial intelligence (AI) as
compared to roadmap milestones and identified use cases pre-
viously established by the Department of Defense (DOD), as well
as to extend the reporting requirement until fiscal year 2030.
The committee recognizes the DOD’s continued investment in AI
capabilities as a strategic priority to maintain technological superi-
ority and operational advantage. To ensure these investments are
effectively aligned with the Department’s broader modernization
goals and to ensure sustained oversight and continuity in assessing
the Department’s AI strategy and execution, the committee be-
lieves that additional review will provide greater visibility into and
sustained oversight of the Department’s progress in developing, in-
tegrating, and operationalizing AI capabilities across mission areas.
Sec. 1605—Report on reserve component integration into
cyber mission force and cyberspace operations
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy and the Commander,
U.S. Cyber Command, in collaboration with the Chief of the Na-
tional Guard Bureau and military service component leadership, to
report on reserve component integration into Cyber Mission Forces.
The committee acknowledges the unique capabilities, skills, and
authorities of reserve component personnel, who often possess ad-
vanced technical expertise and industry relationships from their ci-
vilian careers that are directly applicable to the Department of De-
fense’s cyber mission. The report shall examine: (1) How to utilize
Title 32 authorities to support domestic missions and provide
greater flexibility in integrating talent; (2) Strategies for leveraging
local industry expertise; (3) Methods to track civilian skills; (4) Re-
source requirements; and (5) Recommendations for improved re-
serve component utilization in cyberspace operations. The report
shall be submitted to the congressional defense committees by Feb-
ruary 1, 2026, with the officials providing a briefing by March 1,

Section 33:
2026.
The committee is concerned that the Department has not fully
identified, tracked, or integrated these unique capabilities into its
Cyber Mission Force structure and operational planning. The com-
mittee believes that improved understanding of these issues as ar-
ticulated by this comprehensive assessment and implementation
plan will help ensure that the Department is able to fully leverage
the skills and authorities of the reserve component to the max-
imum extent possible.
Sec. 1606—Evaluation of cyber range management and fund-
ing
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to complete a comprehensive evaluation of De-
partment of Defense cyber range oversight, not later than January

15, 2027, examining the separate executive agent designations for
cyber test and training ranges. The evaluation would assess fund-
ing mechanisms, integration possibilities, and impacts on transfer-
ring systems from test to operational use. Further, the committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees on findings of such evaluation and
any implementation plans for changes to cyber range oversight.
The committee is concerned with inconsistent funding across
cyber ranges and the absence of a consolidated test-to-training
strategy in a domain that requires speed. The committee believes
the current construct of two independent executive agents may im-
pede rapid transition of capabilities to operational use. The com-
mittee notes that as the Cyber Mission Force matures, it is impor-
tant to reevaluate periodically organizational structures supporting
its mission. The committee expects this evaluation to identify effi-
ciencies and improvements that better support the Department’s
cyber requirements.
Sec. 1607—Modification to reporting requirements for Sen-
ior Military Advisor for Cyber Policy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 392a(b) of title 10, United States Code, by modifying the re-
porting requirements for the Senior Military Advisor for Cyber Pol-
icy and Deputy Principal Cyber Advisor. The provision updates var-
ious reporting relationships by replacing references to ‘‘the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy’’ with ‘‘the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Cyber Policy’’ throughout the relevant statutory lan-
guage. This change streamlines the chain of command and clarifies
that cyber policy matters will now be reported directly to the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy rather than the
broader Under Secretary position.
Sec. 1608—Planning, programming, and budget coordination
for operations of cyber mission force
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 167b of title 10, United States Code, to codify enhanced budget
authority for Cyber Mission Force operations of the Commander,
U.S. Cyber Command that had previously been established in sec-
tion 1507 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2022 (Public Law 117–81).
Sec. 1609—Expansion of scope of affirmation of authority
for cyber operations to include defense of critical infra-
structure of the Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would expand the
scope of affirmation of authority for cyber operations under section
394 of title 10, United States Code, to include defense of critical in-
frastructure of the Department of Defense.
Sec. 1610—Review of future force employment concepts and
associated personnel policy needs for evolving cyber
forces
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a review of future force employ-

ment concepts for cyber forces, including all elements of the Cyber
Operations Force, to assess where additional personnel policy
changes may be warranted.
Sec. 1610A—Evaluation of Joint Task Force-Cyber in sup-
port of geographic combatant commands
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive study on estab-
lishing Joint Task Force-Cyber elements across all geographic com-
batant commands and evaluate force employment in support of
combatant commands by July 1, 2026.
Sec. 1610B—Prohibition on availability of funds to modify
authorities of the Commander of United States Cyber
Command
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
use of funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise
made available for fiscal year 2026 for the Department of Defense
to modify, reorganize, or otherwise change the responsibilities, au-
thorities, or command structure of the Commander, U.S. Cyber
Command.
Sec. 1610C—Program for talent management of cyber per-
sonnel through active and reserve transitioning
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to design and implement a program, not later
than May 1, 2026, as part of the Defense Cyber Workforce Frame-
work to support active management of cyber talent transitioning to
the reserve cyber force.
Sec. 1610D—Designation of Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Cyber Policy as principal staff assistant
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 138(b)(8) of title 10, United States Code, to designate the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy as a principal staff as-
sistant that reports directly to the Secretary of Defense.

Cybersecurity and Information Technology
Sec. 1611—Modernization program for full content inspec-
tion
The committee recommends a provision that would modify sec-
tion 1515 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) by formally renaming the modernization
program from ‘‘Network Boundary and Cross-Domain Defense’’ to
‘‘Full Content Inspection’’ (FCI). The provision would add a new im-
plementation phase requiring the integration of artificial intel-
ligence (AI) capabilities into the pilot program by December 1,
2026, in order to illuminate and actively counter foreign cyber ag-
gression against Department of Defense (DOD) networks. The pro-
vision also requires briefings on this program to the congressional
defense committees, with the first briefing not later than November

1, 2026, and additional briefings to follow every year thereafter
until 2028.
The committee acknowledges the increasing sophistication and
capabilities of cyber threats targeting the Department’s networks.
The committee notes that the Department must leverage advanced
technologies, particularly AI, to enhance its cybersecurity posture.
The committee believes these modifications are necessary to broad-
en the scope of the modernization program and ensure the Depart-
ment employs all available technologies to secure defense networks
at the packet layer. The committee further notes that robust FCI
capabilities will provide essential visibility and control over net-
work traffic and data flows, which are critical elements for detect-
ing and mitigating sophisticated cyber attacks that may otherwise
evade conventional security measures.
Sec. 1612—Assessment regarding real-time monitoring of de-
fense weapons platforms for cyber threats
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretaries of each
military department and the Under Secretary of Defense for Intel-
ligence and Security, to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the
feasibility and advisability of establishing a program for imple-
menting real-time monitoring for self-protection capabilities across
Department of Defense weapon system platforms and provide a re-
port to the congressional defense committees detailing findings,
recommendations, and implementation strategies not later than
January 1, 2027.
The committee remains concerned with the increasing threats to
weapon systems, particularly those built before the institution of
cyber security requirements as part of the acquisition process, and
the lack of progress with remediation efforts after many years of
analysis. The committee believes that these platforms should be se-
cured more expeditiously than the 2035 timeline identified in re-
cent comments made by the Department of Defense Zero Trust Of-
fice. Accelerating this timeline is critical to address current and
emerging cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could compromise oper-
ational effectiveness and security of such weapons systems.
Sec. 1613—Assessment of feasibility and advisability of es-
tablishing an operational technology cybersecurity
training center of excellence
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, acting through the Chief Information Officer
of the Department of Defense, to determine the feasibility and ad-
visability of establishing a center of excellence for operational tech-
nology cybersecurity training by December 1, 2026. The provision
would require assessing whether such a center would effectively in-
stitutionalize training on security and the protection of operational
technology and industrial control systems associated with defense
critical infrastructure. The provision would require the Secretary to
submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than December 1, 2026, on the findings and recommendations of
this assessment.

Sec. 1614—Framework for integration of information tech-
nology technical debt assessment into annual budget
process
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a framework for in-
tegrating technical debt assessment into existing Department of
Defense (DOD) processes, not later than September 1, 2026, to sup-
port the fiscal year 2027 planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution processes. The provision would require the Secretary to
reevaluate the Department’s technical debt definition and ensure
budget justification materials include technical debt assessments,
planned investments, and risk evaluations. The provision would re-
quire a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later
than September 15, 2026, on the framework’s implementation and
effectiveness.
The committee supports initiatives to remediate extensive tech-
nical debt across the DOD but remains concerned about inadequate
frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and remediating risks asso-
ciated with deferred investments. The committee believes existing
organizational structures should be leveraged to facilitate more ef-
fective implementation of technical debt management. The com-
mittee recognizes the Cyber Investment Management Board as an
ideal mechanism for coordinating these activities throughout the
Department. The committee expects this approach will strengthen
governance while minimizing administrative burden and promoting
consistent application of technical debt standards.
Sec. 1615—Mission Infrastructure Resilience Task Force
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a Mission Infrastructure Resil-
ience Task Force, within 180 days of the date of the enactment of
this Act, to assess vulnerabilities in defense critical infrastructure
necessary for executing defense operational and contingency plans.
The Task Force would conduct infrastructure vulnerability assess-
ments, develop remediation solutions, and establish readiness as-
sessment frameworks for installation and combatant commanders.
The Task Force must also develop a transition plan for converting
into a permanent Department of Defense organization, not later
than 180 days prior to its September 30, 2030 termination date.
The provision would require the Secretary of Defense to provide an-
nual briefings to the congressional defense committees, beginning
180 days before termination through September 30, 2033.
Sec. 1616—Plan for deploying private fifth generation Open
Radio Access Networks on Department of Defense bases
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretaries of the military departments to develop prioritized lists
of bases that merit investment in private fifth-generation (5G)
Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN), pursuant to section 1526 of
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Pub-
lic Law 118–31) and the Department of Defense (DOD) Private 5G
Deployment Strategy, dated October 2024. The provision would di-
rect the Secretary of Defense to consolidate these prioritized base
lists and determine an optimal investment, deployment, and spend

plan for private 5G ORAN networks across the DOD. The provision
would require coordination among the Secretaries of the military
departments and the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and
Engineering, the Chief Information Officer of the DOD, and rel-
evant combatant commanders and directors of defense agencies.
The Secretary of Defense would be required to provide a report on
this matter to the congressional defense committees, not later than
March 1, 2026.
Sec. 1617—Limitation on funds for travel pending briefing
on process for best-in-class cyber data products and
services
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated for
travel for the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of the Chief In-
formation Officer (CIO) until the DOD CIO, in coordination with
military service CIOs and Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA) Director, provides a briefing to the congressional defense
committees on establishing a competitive process for procuring
best-in-class cybersecurity solutions. The briefing must detail: (1)
The implementation status of Section 1521 requirements from the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public
Law 117–81); (2) An outline of an acquisition strategy for enter-
prise-wide procurement; and (3) Funding estimates for fiscal years
2026–2030.
The committee is concerned with the Department’s failure to for-
mally establish and identify an executive agent and program office,
as required by law. The committee recognizes that while certain of-
fices may perform similar functions, the Department has not offi-
cially designated any entity as the executive agent nor dem-
onstrated how existing structures fulfill the statutory require-
ments. The committee believes this lack of formal designation sig-
nificantly undermines the Department’s ability to implement a co-
hesive, enterprise-wide approach to cybersecurity acquisitions.
Sec. 1618—Limitation of funds for travel expenses for the
Office of the Chief Information Officer
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated for
travel for the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of the Chief In-
formation Officer (CIO) until the DOD CIO, in coordination with
the military departments’ CIOs, submits to the congressional de-
fense committees a comprehensive circuit transport transition plan
for updating legacy circuits to more modern Internet Protocol (IP)-
based circuits. The plan must identify: (1) All legacy circuits still
being used by the Department; (2) Establish transition timelines to
move to IP-based circuits; (3) Detail resource requirements; (4)
Specify budget funding lines where such requirements are cap-
tured; and (5) Include Future Years Defense Program investments.
The committee acknowledges that legacy telecommunications cir-
cuits represent one of the most significant examples of technical
debt within the Department. The committee believes that the De-
partment has been woefully behind in modernizing DOD tele-
communications infrastructure to enhance security and operational

capabilities across defense networks. While the committee acknowl-
edges the Department has undertaken some efforts to address this
issue, the committee remains concerned that insufficient progress
has been made to eliminate these obsolete systems, which pose
substantial risks to both cybersecurity posture and operational
readiness. The committee believes that accelerating the transition
to modern IP-based circuits is essential to maintaining techno-
logical advantage and network resilience in contested environ-
ments.
Sec. 1619—Limitation on availability of funds for the Com-
bined Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the
funds authorized to be appropriated for research, development,
test, and evaluation, Defense-wide, for the Joint Staff and the Chief
Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer for the Combined Joint

view of the transition of the Joint Fires Network initiative to a pro-
gram of record within the Department of the Air Force.
Sec. 1620A—Prohibition of the elimination of certain cyber
assessment capabilities for test and evaluation
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of Defense from divesting, consolidating, or curtailing
current cyber assessment capabilities or National Security Agency-
certified red teams supporting operational test and evaluation for
Department of Defense programs until providing a comprehensive
certification to the congressional defense committees. The certifi-
cation must include an analytic basis for the decision, independent
review by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evalua-
tion, certification by the Director of the Test Resource Management
Center per section 4173(c)(1)(B) of title 10, United States Code, and
a comprehensive transition plan with funding requirements and
continuity measures.
Sec. 1620B—Modification to certification requirement re-
garding contracting for military recruiting
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1555 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to permanently require the Secretary of
Defense to obtain a certification from any entity that contracts with
the Department of Defense for the purpose of placing military re-
cruitment advertisement, that the entity does not rate news infor-
mation sources for factual accuracy or provide ratings or opinions
on news sources regarding misinformation.

integrity of undersea cables
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to convene a working group, not later than
March 1, 2026, to develop a strategy and report on ensuring the
security, resiliency, and integrity of undersea cables.
Subtitle C—Data and Artificial Intelligence
Sec. 1621—Public-private cybersecurity partnership for
highly capable artificial intelligence systems
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy to establish a pub-
lic-private partnership body not later than 180 days after the en-
actment of this Act to address cybersecurity and physical security
threats to highly capable artificial intelligence and machine learn-
ing systems. The partnership would facilitate engagement between
the Department of Defense and commercial industry partners to
align security frameworks against sophisticated state actors. The
provision requires annual reports to congressional defense commit-
tees beginning one year after establishment and continuing until
December 1, 2030.
Sec. 1622—Digital sandbox environments for artificial intel-
ligence
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, acting through the Chief Digital and Artifi-
cial Intelligence Officer and the Department of Defense (DOD)
Chief Information Officer, to establish a task force on artificial in-
telligence sandbox environments, not later than April 1, 2026. The
task force would develop virtual environments supporting artificial
intelligence experimentation across the DOD for users of all tech-
nical proficiency levels. The provision requires an initial briefing to
the congressional defense committees, not later than August 1,
2026, with annual briefings thereafter until the task force termi-
nates on January 1, 2030.
The committee notes with interest the progress made by the De-
partment of the Army in establishing robust artificial intelligence
sandbox capabilities that support both large language models and
essential data science functionalities. The committee recognizes
similar initiatives underway within the Department of the Air
Force and encourages continued development of these critical capa-
bilities. The committee strongly believes these environments are es-
sential for both workforce development and technical innovation in
artificial intelligence applications. The committee emphasizes that
investments into the development and enhancement of these envi-
ronments, ideally across multiple security fabrics, must be
prioritized going forward.

cial intelligence (AI) model assessment and oversight by June 1,

Section 34:
2026. This team, led by the Department of Defense (DOD) Chief
Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer (CDAO), would develop a
standardized assessment framework for DOD AI models not later
than June 1, 2027, with identification of functional area leads not
later than January 1, 2027. Further, initial assessments of major
AI systems would be required no later than January 1, 2028, with
the cross-functional team sunsetting five years after enactment.
The Secretary would be required to brief the congressional defense
committees within 30 days after completion of each implementation
milestone and submit a transition plan to the committees 180 days
before termination.
The committee believes that establishing coherent governance
structures for model assessment, tracking, and oversight is critical
for successful AI implementation across the Department. The com-
mittee emphasizes this governance is especially important in mili-
tary contexts where operational conditions evolve rapidly and mod-
els must adapt accordingly. As battlefield environments change, AI
models require continuous evaluation to maintain effectiveness.
The committee understands a well-structured governance frame-
work would enhance return on investment by enabling the develop-
ment of branch models for correlated use cases while preserving
model lineage information that is essential for proper evaluation.
The committee further notes this framework would establish
groundwork for model assessment reciprocity, allowing more rapid
deployment of models across different components and use cases.
This approach would maximize the Department’s investments in
both custom-developed and commercial AI models.
The committee observes that several federal initiatives have suc-
cessfully implemented such governance frameworks and strongly
encourages the Department to build upon these established best
practices when developing its program to maximize economies of
scale and avoid duplicative development efforts.
The committee emphasizes that this provision is not intended to
create additional bureaucratic hurdles or security requirements
that would impede model development and deployment. The com-
mittee instead intends to facilitate greater transparency into model
capabilities and characteristics, thereby enhancing collaboration
across the Department and accelerating the development of special-
ized branch models. The committee believes this balanced approach
will strengthen the Department’s capacity to harness artificial in-
telligence while maintaining appropriate oversight of these increas-
ingly critical technologies.
Sec. 1624—Department of Defense Ontology Governance
Working Group
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a Department of Defense (DOD)
Ontology Governance Working Group to develop and implement a
common data ontology and governance structure to improve data
interoperability and enable more effective decision-making. The
Working Group would establish domain-specific data ontologies,
designate functional domain leads, and implement a governance
framework. Key deadlines include establishing the Working Group

not later than June 1, 2026, developing Department-level policy not
later than June 1, 2027, and completing implementation not later
than January 1, 2028, with an interim briefing to congressional de-
fense committees from the Working Group due not later than July
1, 2027, and a report to the same committees from the Secretary
due not later than June 30, 2028.
The committee strongly commends the Department’s collabo-
rative efforts with the Chief Data Officer in the Office of the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence through the DOD and Intelligence Com-
munity Ontology Working Group in establishing the Basic Formal
Ontology and Common Core Ontology as foundational elements for
cross-domain information exchange. The committee notes that
these policy actions represent a significant milestone in developing
robust mechanisms for data integration, retrieval, and analysis
across disparate systems. The committee believes it is important to
ensure that there is a clear framework and forum for continuing
this work into building domain-specific ontology at the pace that is
needed. The committee expects that this structured governance ap-
proach will drive substantial advances in ontological interoper-
ability throughout the DOD enterprise and among mission part-
ners, critically enhancing decision superiority and operational effec-
tiveness in an increasingly complex and contested information envi-
ronment.
Sec. 1625—Modification of high-performance computing
roadmap
The committee recommends a provision that would modify the
high-performance computing roadmap requirements in section
1532(c) of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law
118–159). The provision would direct the Secretary of Defense to
expand the roadmap to include both Department of Defense-owned
computing assets and commercially procured cloud services or in-
frastructure-as-a-service contracts. For any data centers to be built
or expanded on military installations, the provision would require
comprehensive assessments including physical space needs, elec-
tricity and water usage requirements for artificial intelligence data
center footprints, anticipated impacts on installations and sur-
rounding communities, and strategies to prevent utility service dis-
ruptions while ensuring community resilience. The Secretary must
provide triennial updates to the roadmap, with the first update due
not later than March 1, 2027, and subsequent updates due every
third year thereafter until March 1, 2033, to be submitted to the
congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1626—Artificial General Intelligence Steering Com-
mittee
The committee recommends a provision that would establish an
Artificial General Intelligence Steering Committee within the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) to analyze artificial intelligence trajec-
tories and develop DOD adoption strategies. The provision would
require the Secretary of Defense to establish the committee by
April 1, 2026, with the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serving as co-chairpersons.

The committee would assess adversary capabilities, analyze mili-
tary applications, and develop adoption strategies, including ethical
guardrails and resource requirements, with a report due to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than January 31, 2027.
Sec. 1627—Physical and cybersecurity procurement require-
ments for artificial intelligence systems
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity and
physical security framework for artificial intelligence (AI) and ma-
chine learning technologies procured by the Department of Defense.
The framework must address workforce risks, supply chain
vulnerabilities, adversarial tampering, data exposure risks, and se-
curity management practices, with security levels scaled to na-
tional security risks and designed to counter peer and near-peer
nation threats. The provision would authorize the Secretary to
amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to
require contractors developing, deploying, storing, or hosting cov-
ered AI technologies to implement the framework’s best practices,
with requirements tailored to specific technologies while consid-
ering cost-benefit analysis. The provision would also require the
Secretary to submit an implementation status report to the con-
gressional defense committees not later than 180 days after the
date of the enactment of this Act, building upon existing frame-
works such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology
Special Publication 800 series and the Cybersecurity Maturity
Model Certification framework.
Sec. 1628—Guidance and prohibition on use of certain artifi-
cial intelligence
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to require all Department of Defense (DOD)
offices and components to exclude or remove covered artificial intel-
ligence from DOD systems and devices within 30 days of the date
of enactment, including artificial intelligence developed by Chinese
company DeepSeek or entities owned or supported by High Flyer.
Further, the provision also prohibits contractors from using such
covered artificial intelligence for DOD contract work after 30 days
of the date of enactment.
Sec. 1629—Roadmap for advancing digital content prove-
nance standards
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to develop a roadmap, not later than June 1,

Items of Special Interest
Advancing Analytics data platform application integration
framework
The committee recognizes the Department of Defense’s (DOD)
substantial investment in the Advancing Analytics (ADVANA) data
platform and commends the progress achieved in establishing a
foundational enterprise data management and visualization pro-
gram. The committee believes that the long-term scalability, sus-
tainability, and mission utility of the ADVANA platform is contin-
gent upon establishing a structured, transparent onboarding frame-
work that aligns with broader DOD digital modernization objec-
tives. However, the committee is concerned that the DOD lacks a
comprehensive strategy for application onboarding that includes
clear evaluation criteria, prioritization methodology, and appro-
priate metrics for determining integration sequencing. Further-
more, the committee notes the absence of standardized cost recov-
ery models to facilitate financial planning between the platform ad-
ministrators and component organizations seeking application inte-
gration.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Chief Digital and Artifi-
cial Intelligence Officer (CDAO) to develop and implement a com-
prehensive application integration strategy for the ADVANA data
platform. This strategy should: (1) Establish objective criteria for
evaluating and prioritizing applications based on operational mis-
sion impact, data sensitivity classification requirements, technical
compatibility with existing ADVANA architecture, and overall
value to the DOD data ecosystem; (2) Define standardized reim-
bursable funding mechanisms, including potential service-level
agreements or other appropriate cost-sharing models, between the
CDAO and requesting DOD components; (3) Include performance
metrics to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the
onboarding process; and (4) Align with existing DOD data govern-
ance policies and enterprise digital transformation initiatives.
The CDAO should complete development and commence imple-
mentation of this framework not later than January 31, 2026. The
committee further directs the CDAO to provide a comprehensive
briefing to the congressional defense committees on the frame-
work’s structure, implementation status, and initial outcomes, not
later than March 31, 2026.
Artificial intelligence for assistive automation
The committee is aware that the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities
Development Command (DEVCOM) Analysis Center has an effort
to develop an analytical framework for leveraging and incor-
porating artificial intelligence (AI) and assistive automation (AA)
into Army operations. This effort supports human-machine teaming
integration by assessing the performance of individuals and teams
assisted with artificial intelligence or autonomous systems through
the development and definition of metrics which will permit quan-
titative and comparative assessment of these new tactical tech-

nologies. The committee believes this will enable the DEVCOM
Analysis Center to conduct analysis on trade-offs of performance,
effectiveness, and vulnerability, as well as analysis on sustain-
ability to enable senior Army decision makers to better evaluate
the impact of integrating developmental AI/AA systems into the
Army structure.
Accordingly, the committee strongly supports extension of the AI/
AA analytical framework and associated metrics to obtain a fuller
understanding of the broad scope of AI/AA applications for mission
command in the Army’s current and future operating environment.
Artificial intelligence-enabled weapons systems center of ex-
cellence
The committee notes that the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159) included section 1534, which required
the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility and advisability
of establishing one or more centers of excellence to support the de-
velopment and maturation of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
weapon systems. The committee believes a federated approach to
such centers will accommodate the differing needs for AI in dif-
ferent domains. The committee notes that the response to that re-
quirement is still in progress but believes that, in responding to
that provision, the Department of Defense should consider how
best to leverage proximity to relevant platforms, as well as where
technical expertise and infrastructure already exist, and how such
efforts might be more closely tied to prototyping, experimentation,
and operational and sustainment activities, in order to best provide
exposure to use cases that might most benefit the Department and
the military services. The committee also urges the Department to
use this as an opportunity to identify and codify relevant AI termi-
nology to provide some consistency, as well as to support future
doctrinal development.
Assessment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities of connected ve-
hicles
The committee recognizes that vehicle digitization and net-
working present both critical opportunities and significant risks for
the Department of Defense (DOD). The committee acknowledges
that connected vehicle technologies offer enhanced sensing capabili-
ties, edge computing, and predictive maintenance that will benefit
military operations. Yet, the committee is concerned that they also
increase the potential attack surface if the DOD is not proactively
prepared to mitigate such risks, as data from these connected vehi-
cles can be used to elicit sensitive patterns of life as well as to pro-
vide outright vectors for cyber attacks against DOD systems and
personnel.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in co-
ordination with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy,
the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the DOD, and the CIOs of
the military departments, to provide a briefing on the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities of connected vehicles and the threats such
vulnerabilities might pose to the DOD to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later

than August 1, 2026. Such briefing must include: (1) Classes of
vulnerabilities presented by connected vehicles, as such connections
might support adversary ubiquitous technical surveillance; (2) A
framework for the Department to assess the risk of such
vulnerabilities, as well as proposed mitigations; (3) An assessment
of the intelligence related to adversary use or exploitation of con-
nected vehicle vulnerabilities; and (4) Identification of centers of
expertise within the DOD with capabilities to identify, assess, miti-
gate, or remediate the kinds of vulnerabilities identified by the De-
partment.
Building core synthetic data sets for model development
The committee is aware that the increasing demands for artifi-
cial intelligence (AI) systems are also increasing demands for data
to train and refine such systems. The consumption of vast amounts
of publicly available data with little or no consideration for the ac-
curacy, bias, or cleanliness of such data for initial training has, in
some cases, resulted in unintended side effects. The committee is
also aware that a response to these shortcomings has been to bal-
ance that initial training with operational or domain specific data
sets that might help refine or focus the AI on specific use cases for
the Department of Defense (DOD). However, that approach also
presents challenges, like limiting competition or comparison be-
tween AI systems and challenging the classification of models
based on their training data.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the DOD, through test or-
ganizations such as the Test Resource Management Center, to gen-
erate more and better synthetic data sets for AI training that can
be shared more broadly with industry, academia, and foreign part-
ners and allies. The committee believes that a focused effort on
synthetic data sets for AI model training would allow the Depart-
ment to make more equitable comparisons of system performance
in support of acquisition competition as well as open up the playing
field to a wider range of industry and academic providers.
Collaborative computing environment in support of AUKUS
partnership
The committee continues to support the Australia, United King-
dom, and United States (AUKUS) agreement and understands the
urgency behind accelerating collaborative progress toward its goals.
To enable this progress, the committee believes that a collaborative
computing environment is necessary to enable Department of De-
fense (DOD) users and their counterparts in the United Kingdom
and Australia to rapidly share information from their own systems
to a common information domain for allied collaboration. This envi-
ronment should have access to productivity tools, digital engineer-
ing, artificial intelligence, and analytics services so that allies can
jointly develop platforms and advanced capabilities at speed and
scale.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense, through the
DOD Chief Information Officer, to conduct a comprehensive study
on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a multi-classifica-
tion level collaborative computing environment to support the
AUKUS partnership initiatives. The study should include a thor-

ough evaluation of various infrastructure options, including cloud-
based, hybrid, and physical infrastructure solutions that would en-
able secure information sharing and joint development capabilities
across different classification levels. The study should address how
such an environment could provide agility by enabling the Depart-
ment to establish additional secure enclaves rapidly, allowing
AUKUS to enable specific communities of interest or incorporate
additional communities quickly, if required. The Secretary should
provide a report on this study to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than January 1, 2026.
Competition related to the adoption of artificial intelligence
and commercial cloud computing capabilities
The committee is aware that the market for artificial intelligence
(AI) and commercial cloud computing capabilities for the Depart-
ment of Defense (DOD) is growing but remains focused on growing
the number of performers rather than clustering around a much
smaller set. The committee is concerned that while there are many
small, non-traditional performers in this space, the opportunities to
break through an increasingly consolidated number of AI models
and applications, as well as commercial cloud providers, appear to
be fewer and further between. While the DOD is increasingly fo-
cused on the many technology requirements for the warfighter, the
committee believes that insufficient attention is being paid to
longer-term market dynamics and preventing repeating past mis-
takes that have led to challenges resulting from market consolida-
tion in areas like aviation components, major weapons systems,
and microelectronics.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment, to provide a report to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than February 15, 2026, as-
sessing the current and long-term AI and commercial cloud com-
puting market. This report shall examine: (1) Competition dynam-
ics between AI and commercial cloud providers, including large and
small companies; (2) Impacts of these competition dynamics on
overall innovation in AI; (3) Barriers to entry for small and new
performers; and (4) The potential or perceived impact of concentra-
tions of market power or market share in the AI space on competi-
tion. The report shall also include recommendations for any legisla-
tive or administrative actions that might improve the DOD’s ability
to make better decisions and increase competition with respect to
AI and commercial cloud resource procurements.
Department of Defense software authorization and accredi-
tation reform
The committee notes that modern software development meth-
odologies are essential to maintaining technological superiority in
an era of strategic competition. Thus, the committee is strongly
supportive of the intent of the Department of Defense (DOD) to im-
prove upon the historically slow and burdensome Authorization to
Operate (ATO) and Risk Management Framework (RMF) proc-
esses. The committee is aware that the Department is considering
implementation of a new process known as Software Fast Track

(SWFT). The committee remains concerned, however, with the lack
of details surrounding the process for SWFT, how it will resolve
these issues, or how it interrelates with implementation of section
1522 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law
118–159), which also streamlines the ATO process.
In addition to ensuring the efforts within SWFT appropriately
balance the need for cybersecurity with removing duplicative and
unnecessary compliance tasks, the committee contends that several
related elements must be incorporated as part of any reform ef-
forts. For example, the committee also notes that congressional di-
rection regarding reciprocal ATO policies has not been fully imple-
mented across the Department. The committee observes that con-
tinuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) processes have dem-
onstrated significant time and cost savings where implemented.
The committee also believes that there is a critical need to address
operational technology (OT) integration and the intersection of in-
formation technology (IT) and OT within authorization frameworks,
as defense systems increasingly converge these domains.
Accordingly, the committee directs the DOD Chief Information
Officer to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
March 1, 2026, on the details of the SWFT initiative and its status,
as well as the plans to integrate compliance with reciprocal ATO
policies, the expansion of cATO adoption, and the integration of
operational technology considerations into the initiative’s lines of
effort. The committee further directs that this briefing should in-
clude, at minimum: (1) Details of the SWFT plan, milestones, and
lines of effort; (2) Metrics on current compliance with reciprocal
ATO policies across the military departments and defense agencies;
(3) Identified barriers to implementation of streamlined software
accreditation processes; (4) Measurable goals for reducing ATO
timelines; (5) Resource requirements to fully implement these ini-
tiatives in fiscal year 2027 and across the Future Years Defense
Plan; and (6) A comprehensive assessment of how OT and the
intersection of IT and OT will be integrated into authorization eval-
uation frameworks, including protocols for evaluating software ap-
plications within converged IT and OT environments.
Evaluation of Department of Defense data residency and re-
tention policies
The committee recognizes that as the Department of Defense
(DOD) expands its investments in cloud computing and data stor-
age capabilities to support operational requirements, a comprehen-
sive evaluation of existing data policies is essential. For example,
the committee understands that while no singular policy mandates
that all DOD data be stored exclusively within the continental
United States, current frameworks generally prioritize domestic
data storage for sensitive operational and intelligence information.
Additionally, the committee understands that current policies re-
lated to the time in which data can be retained for various pur-
poses may actually inhibit the ability to collect and store such oper-
ational data for the purposes of training artificial intelligence (AI)

related to data residency and retention are necessary to make sure
that outdated or unnecessary policies originally intended to serve
other purposes do not stand in the way of effective and efficient op-
eration of the Department’s information technology and AI system
or inhibit the Department’s ability to leverage commercial cloud in-
novations and affect interoperability with security partners during
combined activities.
Therefore, the committee directs the DOD Chief Information Of-
ficer, through the Defense Information Systems Agency, and in col-
laboration with the DOD Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence
Officer, to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than Feb-
ruary 28, 2026, evaluating current data residency and retention re-
quirements and their implications for DOD operations. Such brief-
ing should include: (1) An assessment of the benefits and potential
risks associated with implementing a commercial cloud approach
that is agnostic to data residency for different categories of infor-
mation; (2) An evaluation of double encryption principles and their
effectiveness in protecting data regardless of physical storage loca-
tion; (3) An analysis of sovereign key management frameworks that
incorporate multiple external physical key managers to govern
decryption processes; (4) An examination of how current data resi-
dency requirements affect operational capabilities and information
sharing with security partners; (5) The impact of current data re-
tention policies, either based on policy or statute, on the ability of
the Department to collect and store data to provide for longitudinal
analysis using AI or other machine learning systems; and (6) Rec-
ommendations for policy frameworks that appropriately balance se-
curity imperatives with operational requirements across different
data classification levels.
Evaluation of incentives for acquisition personnel sup-
porting United States Cyber Command
The committee is aware that based on the significant expansion
of authorities granted to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), spe-
cifically the establishment of the Joint Program Executive Office
for the Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture by fiscal year 2027 as
directed in section 1509 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263), there
has been an increasing demand for acquisition and contracting pro-
fessionals to support CYBERCOM. While the Cyber Excepted Serv-
ice (CES), established under section 1599f of title 10, United States
Code, was designed to provide the Department of Defense (DOD)
with enhanced flexibility in recruiting and retaining cyber per-
sonnel, the committee remains concerned that competition for simi-
lar personnel from other Federal agencies, with more competitive
compensation packages and career advancement opportunities, is
putting acute pressure on CYBERCOM to attract and retain such
personnel.
Therefore, the committee directs the Commander, CYBERCOM,
in coordination with the DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy, to conduct a
comprehensive review of existing incentive pay programs and accel-
erated promotion pathways available to acquisition and program

management personnel within the CES. This review should evalu-
ate opportunities to enhance competitive hiring and retention
through improved incentive structures comparable to those offered
by other Federal agencies.
The committee directs the Commander, CYBERCOM; the DOD
CIO; and the Assistant Secretary to jointly brief the congressional
defense committees on the findings, recommendations, and imple-
mentation plan resulting from this review, not later than May 31,

Section 35:
2026.
Expansion of Department of Defense Cyber Service Acad-
emy Eligibility
The committee affirms its support of the scholarship-for-service
program provided through the Department of Defense Cyber Serv-
ice Academy. The committee further appreciates the Department’s
compliance with the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) and the effort
to rapidly award scholarships before the fall semester of 2024.
Under the law, program scholarships are permitted for periods of
up to 5 years. Yet, current Department policy limits program eligi-
bility to students who previously completed the first year of an as-
sociate degree or at least 2 years of a bachelor’s degree program.
The committee is concerned that these limitations on eligibility will
hinder the Department’s efforts to develop and retain the highly
skilled cyber workforce that is necessary to defend the nation
against rapidly evolving threats in cyberspace.
Therefore, the committee strongly encourages the Secretary of
Defense to expand the Cyber Service Academy program to the full
extent permitted by law, extending eligibility to all qualified stu-
dents, including first-year students in associate and bachelor’s de-
gree programs.
Implementing open architecture accreditation of encryption
in mounted form factor program
The committee commends the Department of Defense (DOD) for
progress on implementation of Modular Open Systems Architecture
(MOSA) and, in particular, the Army for progress on the Com-
mand, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Modular Open Suite of
Standards Mounted Form Factor (CMFF) program of record. The
committee looks forward to the Army’s commitment to a long-term
resourced program to realize CMFF benefits including reduced size,
weight, and power of systems, increased capability integration on
armored and tactical vehicles, and speed of development and tech-
nology refresh.
While the committee is encouraged by this progress and the an-
ticipated award of CMFF Block 1, the committee is concerned that
the long-term CMFF program may experience significant delay
without establishment of program security accreditation milestones
and firm delivery and fielding dates. The committee understands
that CMFF needs a clear security accreditation strategy for all
CMFF delivery blocks to maintain its program schedule. A prohibi-
tively complicated and unpredictable accreditation process could

negatively impact levels of industry engagement and investments
and lead to lack of program achievement and accountability.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Army, to provide a report to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than February 1, 2026, out-
lining the strategy for implementing a MOSA-specific accreditation
process for implementing DOD Type 1 encryption security. This re-
port shall include anticipated timelines for the accreditation proc-
ess of CMFF systems as well as details on whether Type 1
encryption will be accredited at the system, subsystem, or compo-
nent level. The report shall also include how such processes would
apply to and impact the Army’s CMFF program delivery schedule
and associated funding portfolio for all CMFF blocks.
Improving cyber coordination with foreign partners
The committee is aware that the Comptroller General of the
United States issued a report titled ‘‘Cyberspace Operations: De-
partment of Defense Should Take Steps to Improve Coordination
with Foreign Partners’’ on July 25, 2024 (GAO–24–103716C). The
report outlined several issues related to the ability of the Depart-
ment of Defense to carry out certain cyber coordination activities
with foreign partners and made several recommendations. How-
ever, the committee is not aware that the Department has yet
taken any action to begin implementing these recommendations.
Due to the high interest in collaborating with our foreign partners
and allies in cyberspace, the committee believes it is important for
the Department to have a comprehensive and holistic foreign en-
gagement strategy that addresses known coordination concerns and
improves overall coordination and prioritization of cyber teams and
resources with the geographic combatant commands to ensure such
activities are best aligned with broader theater security cooperation
plans.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Cyber Policy, in coordination with the Commander, U.S.
Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) and the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to develop a comprehensive foreign partner cyber
engagement strategy and to provide a briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than November 1, 2026. Such a foreign partner cyber en-
gagement strategy shall include the following: (1) A framework to
prioritize country engagements with foreign partners, including a
process for factoring the input of the geographic combatant com-
mands based on their respective theater security cooperation plans;
(2) A process for factoring in requests from foreign partners; (3) A
repeatable methodology for assessing the resources needed to exe-
cute such engagements, in order to promote long-term planning for
sustained engagements; (4) Assessment of burden sharing for costs
between CYBERCOM, the affected geographic combatant com-
mand, and the affected partner nation; (5) A system or dashboard
for tracking and analysis of such foreign partner engagements; (6)
An implementation plan for how the Department intends to resolve
the recommendations made in said GAO report (GAO–24–
103716C); and (7) Other such items that the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Cyber Policy determines to be necessary.

Independent review of lessons learned from United States
Cyber Command acquisition activities
The committee notes that United States Cyber Command
(CYBERCOM) was established with the need to have some distinc-
tive authorities from most other combatant commands.
CYBERCOM is a functional command that at times is a supporting
command and at others is a supported command. The Congress de-
termined CYBERCOM would also need to have acquisition authori-
ties to allow it to develop cyber-peculiar technologies. The com-
mittee acknowledges that developing the core competency, work-
force, processes, and experience to effectively manage an acquisi-
tion enterprise takes time. The committee believes CYBERCOM is
making progress in this direction but also recognizes the oppor-
tunity to evaluate CYBERCOM’s progress in this respect to deter-
mine areas to aid its growth.
Therefore, the committee directs the Inspector General of the De-
partment of Defense to conduct an independent review of the acqui-
sition activities of CYBERCOM and provide a briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than September 30, 2026.
Such a review should include an assessment of the: (1) Sufficiency
of the acquisition and contracting workforce to determine if
CYBERCOM has a sufficient mix of numbers and skill sets based
on the scale of acquisition activities it is executing, including con-
tracted support; (2) Metrics being used to determine the timeliness
and effectiveness of in-house and assisted acquisition activities; (3)
Processes related to acquisition decision-making to determine if
timelines can be reduced or made more efficient; (4) Timeliness and
effectiveness of entities providing assisted acquisition support to
CYBERCOM; (5) Market research capabilities of CYBERCOM, in-
cluding a representative sample of market research artifacts to as-
sess the sufficiency of such market research; and (6) Lessons
learned from recent acquisition actions and the extent to which
such lessons have been incorporated into CYBERCOM processes.
Integration of local initiatives, small business programs,
and academic institutions to limit gaps between training
events
The committee recognizes the critical importance of maintaining
continuous technical training and skill development throughout the
cyber operator pipeline within the Department of Defense (DOD).
The committee understands that training gaps are often inevitable
due to scheduling constraints, resource limitations, and the com-
plex nature of multi-phase cyber education programs.
The committee believes that while complete elimination of train-
ing interruptions may not be feasible, viable options exist to pre-
vent trainees from experiencing extended periods of downtime that
could result in skill degradation and compromised mission readi-
ness. The committee is aware that there are local initiatives, small
business partnerships, and academic collaborations that exist that
could be leveraged to bridge these gaps.
Accordingly, the committee encourages such partnerships with
small business programs and academic institutions that can offer
hands-on training in simulated environments, operational cyber
range experience, and targeted coursework to develop cyber talent.

The committee notes the Mississippi Cyber Initiative as an exam-
ple of an effective local partnership that provides valuable supple-
mentary training opportunities for servicemembers. The committee
believes these programs have the potential to enhance DOD capa-
bilities, address critical cybersecurity challenges, and strengthen
the national cyber workforce while ensuring cyber operators remain
technically proficient throughout their training pipeline.
Leveraging artificial intelligence-enabled training environ-
ments for cyber readiness
The committee encourages the Department of Defense (DOD) to
build upon its 2023 Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Adoption Strategy by leveraging machine learning and natural lan-
guage processing to create dynamic, threat-informed training envi-
ronments. The committee believes that these capabilities should
enable real-time, AI-generated threat scenarios for faster and more
adaptive military cyber training while also enabling realistic sim-
ulation of cyber-kinetic attack scenarios on military networks to en-
hance the protection of critical systems from foreign adversaries.
The committee assesses that adoption of these technologies may
strengthen national security posture across all domains through
agile, cost-effective, and scalable solutions that enable personnel to
engage with AI-driven adversaries in realistic, scenario-based as-
sessments.
The committee further recommends that the DOD prioritize in-
vestments in autonomous and adaptive learning platforms that in-
tegrate seamlessly with both on-premise infrastructure and com-
mercial cloud environments. By integrating AI-enabled platforms
into existing test and evaluation frameworks, the committee be-
lieves that the Department could accelerate the development of re-
silient cyber, space, and missile defense capabilities while signifi-
cantly reducing costs associated with traditional training models.
Modernization of Department of Air Force reserve compo-
nent business applications
The committee recognizes the critical importance of our nation’s
reserve components and their invaluable contributions to the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) and to national security. The com-
mittee has long been a strong advocate for ensuring that reserve
forces receive the necessary resources and support to maintain
peak readiness and operational effectiveness. The committee under-
stands that for reserve personnel to maximize their focus on readi-
ness and training activities during training status, they must be
supported by efficient and modern business support systems that
enable core administrative functions. The committee acknowledges
that streamlined processes for order generation, approval, and
other essential administrative tasks are fundamental to operational
success and personnel satisfaction.
The committee is deeply concerned with the poor state and clear
lack of investment in Air Force reserve component business sys-
tems, particularly the Unit Training Assembly Processing System
(UTAPS) and the Air Force Reserve Online Workflow System
(AROWS). The committee has received reports indicating that
these critical systems are extremely cumbersome to navigate and

operate, creating unnecessary administrative burdens for reserve
personnel who should be concentrating on mission-critical training
and readiness activities. The committee is further troubled that
these systems, due to insufficient updates and modernization ef-
forts, present significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could
compromise personnel information.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a comprehensive briefing outlining a detailed, one-year
modernization plan for core Air Reserve component business appli-
cations, including UTAPS and AROWS, not later than June 30,
2026, to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives. Such a plan should include specific fund-
ing requirements, detailed contract requirements and acquisition
strategies, and a robust user engagement and feedback component
to ensure continuous improvement and user satisfaction.
Multimodal generative artificial intelligence language trans-
lation capabilities
The committee recognizes artificial intelligence’s (AI) ability to
improve the Department of Defense’s warfighting posture, includ-
ing by providing enhanced foreign language translation capabili-
ties. Several military units are currently utilizing multimodal gen-
erative AI foreign language translation capabilities that include
text, audio, video, and image integrated with automated human-in-
the-loop review and verification processes that allow for mission-
specific, live fine-tuning. This capability is being used to great ef-
fect, augmenting linguists such that tasks that used to take a
month are now being completed in a few days. Such capabilities re-
sult in a high return on investment for a wide range of mission
areas, including joint exercises, intelligence, information oper-
ations, and counterintelligence investigations. The committee notes
that deployment of this technology is critical to ensure the
warfighter is fully equipped and that the Department is efficiently
utilizing resources to meet critical mission needs.
The committee is concerned that using humans to manually
translate virtually all foreign language media is an unsustainable
and high-cost effort that will never fully address the foreign lan-
guage translation needs of our forces without the assistance of
modern technology. Therefore, the committee encourages the Sec-
retary of Defense to invest in and utilize multimodal generative AI
foreign language translation capabilities that include automated
human-in-the-loop review and verification processes and built-in
mission-specific live fine-tuning, at scale across all services, com-
batant commands, and appropriate mission areas.
Munitions production decision support
The committee commends the Department of Defense for work-
ing diligently to try to increase munitions production goals to bet-
ter position the Department to prepare for future contingencies and
support its partners and allies. The committee is aware that efforts
such as the Joint Production Accelerator Cell and the Wartime Ac-
quisition and Sustainment Support Plan used by the Navy have in-
creased analytical support and attention to try to identify bottle-
necks in the process. However, the committee notes that, to date,

the processes used for capturing the outputs of such analyses, and
continuously updating and sharing such data, is startlingly anti-
quated and manually intensive for a data-powered organization
like the Department of Defense.
Accordingly, the committee believes it is critical for the Depart-
ment’s efforts to transition to an information technology-based deci-
sion support system or dashboard to better collect, analyze, vis-
ualize, and share information related to munitions production, pref-
erably linked with related processes for developing the munitions
requirements and operational planning tools in order to improve
the speed and scalability of planning and execution.
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy
resourcing
The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense
(DOD) is not adequately investing in and providing the resources
necessary to build out the Office of the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Cyber Policy (OASD(CP)) to match the statutory respon-
sibilities outlined by the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) and the coordination needs
for that office. The committee recognizes that these resources are
needed to ensure that there is adequate technical, operational, and
policy experience in key areas that will build capabilities and a
workforce that is able to reestablish a credible cyber deterrent and
hold our adversaries at risk through the imposition of costs. Fur-
thermore, in order to meet its service-secretary-like responsibilities
to maintain civilian control over our cyber forces, as well as to fully
realize its intended benefits in workforce development, cyber capa-
bilities enhancement, and strategic deterrence implementation, this
office needs to be sized to exert similar oversight as a major func-
tional combatant command.
The committee is aware of a comprehensive resourcing study con-
ducted prior to the formal establishment of the OASD(CP). Accord-
ingly, building upon that initial study and reviewing its conclu-
sions, the committee directs the OASD(CP) to conduct an updated
resourcing study for the office. Such study should include: (1) A
thorough assessment of needed technical and operational experi-
ence requirements, both in terms of numbers of individuals as well
as types and diversity of skill disciplines needed; (2) A detailed
evaluation of limitations within existing Cyber Excepted Service
hiring authorities, as well as other hiring authorities available to
this office; (3) Recommendations for integration of Highly Qualified
Experts or special Government employees to provide unique
skillsets not readily available within the Government; and (4) Iden-
tification of various courses of action for future investments aligned
with the National Defense Strategy’s priorities.
The committee further directs that the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Cyber Policy provide the report on the completed study
to the congressional defense committees, not later than January 31,
2026, and deliver a comprehensive briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the study’s
findings, the courses of action presented to the Secretary, and the
Secretary’s final decision.

Phishing-resistant authentication
The committee notes that the importance of protecting the De-
partment of Defense’s (DOD) systems and networks is underscored
by investment in the principles of zero trust, including managing
identity and access using phishing-resistant authentication. The
committee further notes that while the DOD has established a
process for approval of new multifactor authentication technologies,
to date few approvals appear to have made it through that process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to de-
velop a strategy to ensure that phishing-resistant authentication,
which includes hardware-based public key infrastructure, is used
by all personnel of the DOD and to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, not later than May 1, 2026. The strategy shall include
an action plan for the deployment of phishing-resistant authentica-
tion across the DOD and retirement of legacy authentication tools
by the end of fiscal year 2027. The strategy should also include ex-
ceptions for applications in which the use of phishing-resistant au-
thentication is not feasible or practical and should require a proc-
ess for components seeking an exception to provide documentation
of an appropriate mitigation of the risk imposed by not using
phishing-resistant authentication.
Realignment of the Defense Cyber Crime Center
The committee recognizes the Department of Defense (DOD)
Cyber Crime Center (DC3) has a unique, multi-mission capability
supporting law enforcement, counterintelligence, cyber threat anal-
ysis, digital forensics, and defense industrial base (DIB) cybersecu-
rity incident response. The committee further notes that DC3 con-
tinues to serve as a national-level partner for cyber incident coordi-
nation and forensic support.
At the same time, the committee acknowledges the expanded re-
sponsibilities of the Department of Defense Cyber Defense Com-
mand (DCDC), which is tasked with the protection and operational
defense of the DOD Information Network (DODIN). In fulfilling
this mission, DCDC increasingly requires access to and awareness
of threats and trends affecting both the DODIN and interconnected
systems across the DIB, as well as mechanisms for enhanced en-
gagement and collaboration with those DIB partners on cybersecu-
rity threats and vulnerabilities.
The committee notes there is substantial functional alignment
between DC3 and DCDC in the following mission areas: (1) Cyber
incident analysis and coordination; (2) Digital forensics and
malware analysis; (3) Assessment of threats to DOD networks and
critical infrastructure; (4) Support to defensive cyberspace oper-
ations; and (5) Early warning and situational awareness related to
cyber intrusions and malicious cyber campaigns.
Given these shared mission areas, the committee believes it is es-
sential for the Department to ensure DCDC maintains a holistic
operational picture of threats to the DODIN, including those origi-
nating in the DIB or identified through digital forensics analysis.
The committee is concerned that failure to integrate or align rel-
evant elements of DC3 with DCDC could result in mission duplica-

tion, fragmented awareness of emerging threats, or the unneces-
sary development of parallel capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee urges the Secretary of Defense to as-
sess options to better align DC3 with DCDC, including through for-
mal coordination mechanisms, enhanced tasking authorities, or re-
vised organizational alignment. In doing so, the DOD should en-
sure continued support for DC3’s law enforcement and counter-
intelligence authorities while enabling DCDC to fully leverage
DC3’s existing capabilities in support of its operational mission.
Strategy for identifying and addressing blockchain
The committee recognizes that emerging cyber technologies like
blockchain pose significant threats. The committee is concerned
that the Department of Defense (DOD) currently lacks adequate ca-
pabilities to collect and analyze intelligence on blockchain applica-
tions and transactions. The committee notes this intelligence gap
leaves the DOD unable to effectively counter blockchain-enabled
activities including illicit trafficking of military dual-use tech-
nology, terrorism financing, sanctions evasion, and ransomware op-
erations that fund hostile military activities.
The committee believes the DOD needs a comprehensive
blockchain strategy that addresses four key areas: identification of
blockchain capabilities, risk and vulnerability analysis, threat miti-
gation, and capability development. The committee expects this
strategy to integrate the Department’s intelligence, cybersecurity,
and analytical capabilities to disrupt adversarial cyber operations,
counter illicit financial networks that threaten military security,
and guide strategic investments across the enterprise.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to de-
velop a strategy for analyzing blockchain technology applications—
including identifying classes of vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and
proposing mitigations and opportunities—and to brief the congres-
sional defense committees on the strategy, not later than July 1,

Section 36:
2026. Such strategy should include: (1) Options for streamlining
and formalizing investment and leveraging commercial tools for
blockchain analysis and utilization; (2) Policy and budgetary
changes needed to facilitate broader adoption of commercial
blockchain intelligence technologies; (3) Recommendations to better
enable real-time blockchain intelligence sharing and integration be-
tween the DOD and interagency and international partners; and
(4) Recommendations to enhance the traceability of foreign military
and state-sponsored cyber unit blockchain transactions targeting
U.S. defense and critical infrastructure.
Strategy for private cloud capabilities
The committee recognizes the Department of Defense has devel-
oped multiple cloud offerings to meet the diverse mission require-
ments of its components and military services. The Defense Infor-
mation Systems Agency (DISA) has made significant investments
in both commercial cloud solutions under the Joint Warfighting
Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract and private cloud infrastructure.
These private cloud environments provide many benefits similar to
public cloud solutions’ benefits, such as flexibility, agility,

scalability, and availability, while ensuring secure and controlled
deployments for sensitive missions.
The committee is aware that the Department is currently invest-
ing in enhancements to its private cloud capabilities, namely the
Stratus program, to provide improved options to mission partners.
However, the committee requires additional information regarding
how these investments will deliver unique capabilities not already
available through existing cloud offerings.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chief Information Officer of
the Department of Defense to provide a briefing to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than March 31, 2026, on the
Department’s comprehensive private cloud strategy. This briefing
should include: (1) Current status of existing private cloud platform
implementation; (2) Identification of opportunities for expanded
private cloud deployment; (3) Assessment of how private cloud in-
vestments complement public cloud capabilities; (4) Evaluation of
security and operational advantages of private cloud solutions; and
(5) Analysis of how the overall private cloud strategy advances data
protection, mission resilience, and cost and energy efficiencies with-
in the Department’s modernization efforts.
Time-based objectives for Department of Defense data re-
covery
The committee remains concerned that the United States faces
an intensifying and sophisticated national security threat, particu-
larly in the cyber domain, from the People’s Republic of China. The
committee is aware that malicious cyber actors increasingly target
backup systems and data repositories as part of coordinated at-
tacks against Department of Defense (DOD) networks and systems.
The committee notes that resilient and rapidly deployable data re-
covery mechanisms are necessary for DOD components to prevent
catastrophic and extended loss of mission-critical capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the DOD Chief Information
Officer, in coordination with the DOD Chief Digital and Artificial
Intelligence Officer, to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than April 30, 2026, on a Department-wide evaluation of
existing policies and implementation guidance governing Recovery
Time Objective metrics for mission-essential data systems. Such
briefing should: (1) Examine current authoritative documentation
provided to the Department regarding maximum allowable restora-
tion timeframes following cyber compromise; (2) Identify systems
that currently satisfy established recovery time objective require-
ments; (3) Document the modern data recovery capabilities em-
ployed across the Department; and (4) Evaluate systems presenting
the highest vulnerability to cyber compromise. The briefing should
also include the development of recommendations for appropriate
recovery capabilities to mitigate identified technical and policy gaps
across the DOD enterprise.
Transition strategy for formal methods in software and
hardware development

(DOD) systems. The committee notes that formal methods and ap-
proaches for validation and verification, which establish mathe-
matical guarantees in software code, can be used to prove the ab-
sence of exploitable vulnerabilities. The committee also notes that
such approaches can and have also been used to secure hardware
systems as well, demonstrating even broader application of formal
methods.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense, acting through
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment,
the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the
Director for Operational Test and Evaluation, the Director of the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy, and the Department of
Defense Chief Information Officer, to develop a comprehensive
strategy for transitioning DARPA’s formal methods research in-
vestments into production environments across the DOD.
The committee directs that the strategy include the following ele-
ments: (1) Identification of high-priority software and hardware-
based platforms and systems for consideration for initial integra-
tion of formal methods approaches, with specific timelines and im-
plementation phases; (2) A description of integration pathways for
transitioning formal methods into both programs in sustainment
and newly acquired systems; (3) An assessment of necessary invest-
ments in workforce training, tooling, and infrastructure to enable
successful adoption of formal methods at scale; (4) Metrics to meas-
ure the effectiveness and return on investment of formal methods
implementation across different system types; and (5) Development
of incentives for industry to adopt such approaches for programs
they are developing.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives on this transition strategy, not
later than March 31, 2026, including specific resource require-
ments, policy recommendations, and implementation milestones.
United States Cyber Command dual-hat leadership arrange-
ment
The committee continues to assess the effectiveness of the dual-
hat leadership arrangement under which a single individual serves
as both the Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) and
the Director, National Security Agency (NSA). Established in 2010,
this structure was intended to improve operational integration and
alignment between the two organizations in support of national se-
curity objectives.
The committee notes that in 2022, the Secretary of Defense and
the Director of National Intelligence sponsored an interagency re-
view of the dual-hat arrangement. The study concluded that sepa-
rating the leadership roles would increase cost, reduce unity of ef-
fort, and result in less decisive national security outcomes. The
analysis further found that the existing arrangement enhances co-
ordination, accelerates decision-making, and achieves greater effi-
ciency in the employment of cyber and signals intelligence capabili-
ties.

The committee further notes that Congress increased its over-
sight of the NSA/CYBERCOM relationship in section 1556 of the
James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263), directing the Secretary of Defense
to provide annual briefings on the command relationship and oper-
ational coordination between the two organizations. This provision
amended sec. 1642 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328), limiting the ability to ter-
minate the dual-hat only following the satisfaction of certain condi-
tions that would have to be jointly certified by the Secretary of De-
fense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that such a de-
cision would not pose risks to the military effectiveness of
CYBERCOM that are unacceptable to the national security inter-
ests of the United States. To date, the Department of Defense has
yet to satisfy either provision.
The committee further notes that breaking up the dual-hat rela-
tionship would have significant risk at the strategic, operational,
and tactical level. The committee further acknowledges there would
also be cost impacts incurred by building the appropriate infra-
structure for two separate leadership organizations. The cost for
doing so has not yet been determined.
The committee believes that the dual-hat arrangement continues
to serve the best interests of U.S. national security and resource
stewardship and encourages the Department to maintain and
strengthen this structure.
The committee therefore directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on the in-
frastructure requirements and costs associated with changing or
potentially ending the dual-hat leadership arrangement, not later
than December 1, 2025.
Zero trust implementation
The committee appreciates recent updates on the progress made
by the Department of Defense (DOD) toward zero trust implemen-
tation but remains concerned that the DOD faces aggressive
timelines to adhere to the 2027 zero trust mandates directed by the
DOD Zero Trust Strategy. The committee believes that to achieve
goals within DOD-specified timelines, military departments, com-
batant commands, and other DOD components should leverage
scalable, security-certified, and managed services solutions like the
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) program,
Thunderdome, that went through an open vendor selection process
and comprehensive prototyping before production. Where a man-
aged solution does not effectively satisfy requirements, the com-
mittee believes that components should, to the greatest extent pos-
sible, leverage existing blanket purchase agreements and similar
DOD-wide procurement vehicles that offer easy and efficient access
to solutions at the appropriate security level. The committee under-
stands such solutions allow components to adopt the full range of
zero trust capabilities including edge computing, internet-of-things,
remote user access, and other technologies in a manner that best
integrates with the component’s existing security architecture and
requirements.

vehicles they can leverage to quickly and efficiently acquire the
technologies and solutions necessary to achieve their zero trust im-
plementation goals.

DIVISION B—MILITARY CONSTRUCTION
AUTHORIZATIONS
Summary and explanation of funding tables
Division B of this Act authorizes funding for military construc-
tion projects of the Department of Defense (DOD). It includes fund-
ing authorizations for the construction and operation of military
family housing as well as military construction for the reserve com-
ponents, the Defense Agencies and Field Activities, and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program. It also
provides authorization for the base closure accounts that fund mili-
tary construction, environmental cleanup, and other activities re-
quired to implement the decisions made in prior base realignment
and closure rounds.
The tables contained in this Act provide the project-level author-
izations for the military construction funding authorized in division
B of this Act and summarize that funding by account.
The fiscal year 2026 budget request included $18.9 billion for
military construction and housing programs. Of this amount, $15.2
billion was requested for military construction, $1.8 billion for the
construction and operation of family housing, $448.0 million for
base closure activities, and $410.2 million for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization Security Investment Program.
The committee recommends the authorization of appropriations
for military construction, housing programs, facilities sustainment,
and base closure activities totaling $40.7 billion. The total amount
authorized for appropriations reflects the committee’s continued
commitment to investing in the recapitalization of DOD facilities
and infrastructure.
Sec. 2001—Short title
The committee recommends a provision that would designate di-
vision B of this Act as the ‘‘Military Construction Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2026.’’
Sec. 2002—Expiration of authorizations and amounts re-
quired to be specified by law
The committee recommends a provision that would establish the

ties, and contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
Security Investment Program as October 1, 2028, or the date of the
enactment of an Act authorizing funds for military construction for
fiscal year 2029, whichever is later.

ommendations relating to information sharing to im-
prove oversight of military construction
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to implement the recommendations of the
Government Accountability Office report, published September 16,
2024, titled, ‘‘Military Construction: Better Information Sharing
Would Improve DOD’s Oversight’’ (GAO–2024–106499), not later
than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, or to report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives explaining why the Secretary has not imple-
mented those recommendations.
Additionally, the committee directs the Secretary to provide a
one-time briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, on the status of implementing these recommendations.
Sec. 2806—Extension of requirement for contract for obliga-
tion and execution of design funds for military construc-
tion projects

Sec. 2807—Extension of authorization of depot working cap-
ital funds for unspecified minor military construction
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2208(u)(4) of title 10, United States Code, to extend the au-
thorization of depot working capital funds for unspecified minor
military construction projects from 2025 to 2027.
Sec. 2808—Extension of authority for temporary expanded
land acquisition for equine welfare
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2804(c) of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and

Subtitle B—Military Housing
Sec. 2821—Improvements to annual reports of Department
of Defense on waivers of privacy and configuration
standards for covered military unaccompanied housing
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2856a of title 10, United States Code, by adding elements to
be included in future iterations of the barracks waiver reports sub-
mitted by the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD and the
military services have made progress toward improving unaccom-
panied housing, but the committee remains concerned that many
servicemembers continue to be housed in substandard conditions,
as described by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a
report published on September 19, 2023, titled ‘‘Military Barracks:
Poor Living Conditions Undermine Quality of Life and Readiness’’
(GAO–23–105797).
Additionally, in accordance with the requirements of section 2833
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024
(Public Law 118–31), the GAO provided the committee with a brief-
ing on the first DOD report submitted under section 2856a of title
10, United States Code, which revealed certain limitations in the
current report requirements. The provision would improve and
strengthen future iterations of the report so that it provides infor-
mation vital to improvement in the long-term conditions of bar-
racks across the services.
Sec. 2822—Modification of Housing Requirements and Mar-
ket Analysis to account for impact of civilians and con-
tractors
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2837(d) of title 10, United States Code, to account for impacts
of civilians and contractors of the Department of Defense.
Sec. 2823—Authority for unaccompanied housing project
under pilot authority for use of other transactions for
installation or facility prototyping
The committee recommends a provision that would grant permis-
sive authority to the Secretary of Defense to conduct an unaccom-
panied housing project under section 4022(i) of title 10, United
States Code.
Sec. 2824—Elimination of indoor residential mold in housing
of Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for Health Affairs, the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to con-
duct a comprehensive study on the health effects of indoor residen-
tial mold growth in military unaccompanied housing or other hous-
ing on military installations.

Sec. 2825—Requirement for disclosure of information relat-
ing to liability insurance and dispute resolutions relat-
ing to privatized military housing
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2891c(a)(2) of title 10, United States Code, by requiring land-
lords of privatized military housing units to disclose to the Sec-
retary of Defense information relating to insurance coverage and
payments for dispute resolutions with tenants.
Sec. 2826—Treatment of nondisclosure agreements with re-
spect to privatized military housing
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2890(f) of title 10, United States Code, to prohibit a landlord
from requesting that a tenant or prospective tenant of a privatized
housing unit sign a nondisclosure agreement.
Subtitle C—Land Conveyances
Sec. 2831—Authorization to acquire through exchange or
lease certain land used by the Armed Forces in Hawaii
The committee recommends a provision that would temporarily
authorize the Department of Defense to acquire mission critical
military training lands that are currently leased by the military de-
partments from the State of Hawaii. The committee’s intent for
this provision would be to address the multiple military training
ranges across Hawaii that have expiring leases in the near future.
Sec. 2832—Report on land withdrawals
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Army to submit a report on certain land with-
drawals.
Subtitle D—Other Matters
Sec. 2841—Modifications to Defense Community Infrastruc-
ture Program
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2391(d)(1)(B) of title 10, United States Code, to modify the pri-
ority list and definitions for Defense Community Infrastructure
Program projects.
Sec. 2842—Designation of Ronald Reagan Space and Missile
Test Range at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands
The committee recommends a provision that would redesignate
the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site as the Ron-
ald Reagan Space and Missile Test Range to better reflect the
range’s broader role in supporting the development and operation
of long-range missile systems, defenses, and space capabilities.
Sec. 2843—Joint base facility management of Department of
Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would improve the
Department of Defense’s (DOD) facility management of joint bases.

The committee notes that preliminary findings from an ongoing
Government Accountability Office (GAO) report show that the DOD
has faced challenges in ensuring that the 12 joint bases are man-
aging the sustainment, restoration, and modernization of their fa-
cilities to support mission needs. The GAO also notes that the DOD
facilities are requiring more work to maintain, due to facility age,
accumulated deferred maintenance, and older systems such as
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The committee notes
that the DOD has not provided consistent and clear guidance on
facility maintenance responsibilities and funding. In the absence of
guidance specific to joint base management, each joint base is ap-
proaching issues such as facility management in a fragmented
manner, and this has led to issues such as lingering disputes about
how to fund critical infrastructure needs. The DOD also has been
unable to determine how funding for facility maintenance is allo-
cated among military components on joint bases. This has pre-
vented the DOD from completing a determination of whether there
is any funding discrepancy between the joint base components and
whether any such discrepancy is negatively impacting mission
readiness. Further, the DOD has not regularly assessed whether
they have the staff that is needed to meet changing requirements
and to keep DOD facilities in good working order to support the
mission and provide servicemembers with good quality of life.
Sec. 2844—Limitation on use of amounts for travel based on
compliance with requirements related to minimum cap-
ital investment
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit both
the service secretary and service chief of a military department
from using any funds to travel outside of the continental United
States should their respective military department not be in com-
pliance with section 2680 of title 10, United States Code.
The committee notes the minimum facilities sustainment funding
set forth in section 2680 will be specifically used for maintaining
existing infrastructure as well as demolition funding to dispose of
excess inventory. The committee encourages Department of De-
fense senior leadership to review and utilize existing authorities to
improve its facility backlog.
Sec. 2845—Extension of prohibition on joint use of Home-
stead Air Reserve Base with civil aviation
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2874 of the Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023, Division B of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–253), by strik-
ing ‘‘September 30, 2028,’’ and inserting ‘‘September 30, 2034’’.
Sec. 2846—Pilot program on procurement of utility services
for installations of the Department of Defense through
areawide contracts
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a pilot program for the purposes
of the military departments to procure utility services from an
areawide contract with a public utility provider. The provision

would also require the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to
the congressional defense committees within 90 days of the pilot
program terminating on any efficiencies, benefits, or cost-savings
derived under the pilot along with any proposed solutions for tran-
sition the authority to a permanent status.
The committee notes that under this pilot program, the Secretary
of each military department must enter into at least one areawide
contract within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this Act.
Sec. 2847—Authorization for monetary contributions to the
conveyees of utility systems for infrastructure improve-
ments
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2688(k) of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the De-
partment of Defense to pair utilities privatization with the Energy
Resilience and Conservation Investment Program.
Sec. 2848—Prohibition on use of funds for development of
Greenbury Point Conservation Area at Naval Support
Activity Annapolis, Maryland
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
use of funds for development of Greenbury Point Conservation Area
at Naval Support Activity Annapolis, Maryland.
Sec. 2849—Application of certain authorities and standards
to historic military housing and associated historic
properties of the Department of the Navy and the De-
partment of the Air Force
The committee recommends a provision that would amend title
54, United States Code, to apply certain authorities and standards
to historic military housing and associated historic properties of the
Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force.
Items of Special Interest
B–21 bomber shelter strategy
The committee notes that the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159) required the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on
the suitability of open-sided environmental protection shelters
(EPSs) in comparison to traditional hangars for B–21 bomber air-
craft operating out of installations that are at risk of severe weath-
er events. The committee notes that the briefing shows the poten-
tial of EPSs in terms of cost savings and accelerating construction
time. The committee notes the Air Force stated that building tradi-
tional hangars instead would cost an additional $3.0 billion in mili-
tary construction funding and $8.3 billion in life-cycle sustainment
costs. The committee understands that EPSs can also improve bed-
down times by a number of years, which will increase operational
readiness. The committee finally notes that while there are cases
where a traditional hangar is preferred, such as in extreme cold or
blizzards, the Air Force noted that EPSs are the preferred solution
with a small mix of traditional hangars.

The committee believes the Air Force should continue to focus on
EPS as an alternative to traditional hangar construction depending
on the operational mission requirement.
Civilian housing at public naval shipyards
The committee is aware that the availability and affordability of
housing in communities surrounding the public naval shipyards is
relevant to the ability of the government to recruit and retain
skilled shipyard workers. Therefore, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy
and the Director of the Office of Industrial Policy of the Depart-
ment of Defense, and informed by the operational commanders of
shipyard workers and commanders who manage shore infrastruc-
ture, to provide a report to the congressional defense committees,
not later than September 30, 2027, on the feasibility, costs, and
benefits of providing apartment-style or dormitory housing units
for civilian workers at the four public naval shipyards, to include:
(1) An assessment of the estimated costs of constructing,
maintaining, and leasing apartment-style or dormitory housing
units for civilian workers at public naval shipyards;
(2) An assessment of the potential economic and workforce
effects of providing such housing units, including on recruit-
ment and retention rates;
(3) An assessment of the feasibility of providing such housing
units, including the timeline required for implementation;
(4) An assessment of the operational effects of providing such
housing units, including on worker availability, morale, and
commuting burdens;
(5) An assessment of the effect of providing such housing
units on the housing market in surrounding areas, including
for non-shipyard workers;
(6) Options for deducting fair-market rent or below-market
housing fees directly from employee paychecks, including ad-
ministrative, legal, and contractual implications;
(7) Comparisons with similar workforce housing models used
by the Department of Defense or other Federal agencies; and
(8) Case studies of at least two covered naval shipyards that
include specific data on the potential effectiveness of providing
apartment-style or dormitory housing units for civilian workers
at such shipyards.
For the purposes of the report, the public naval shipyards shall
be considered to be:
(1) Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia;
(2) Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Mainte-
nance Facility, Hawaii;
(3) Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Maine; and
(4) Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Mainte-
nance Facility, Washington.

any facilities that produce energy, including but not limited to,
electrical, chemical, thermal, mechanical, and nuclear energy. Ad-
ditionally, the only limiting factor to the committee not specifically
amending section 2922a of title 10, United States Code, to this end
is a direct spending score by the Congressional Budget Office. Last-
ly, the committee intends for the Department of Defense to inter-
pret this statute as such, especially as it relates to area-wide con-
tracts and other non-Department funded energy projects.
Comptroller General review of maintenance of general and
flag officer quarters
The committee is concerned with how the Department of Defense
(DOD) manages the maintenance of General and Flag Officer Quar-
ters (GFOQs), in particular the planning and costs for maintenance
of these units. Generally, the military services’ GFOQs are older
and larger than typical military family housing, and many of these
properties are historic, with some dating back to the early 19th
century. These factors make general and flag officer homes costly
to maintain.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on cost in-
creases in GFOQ renovation projects and raised questions about
the military services’ management of these units over 20 years ago,
in a report published on May 17, 2004, titled ‘‘Issues Related to the
Renovation of General and Flag Officer Quarters’’ (GAO–04–555).
In that 2004 report, the GAO found that requests for changes to
housing units—typically from the quarters’ occupant or the instal-
lation’s command officials—and unforeseen repairs were the pri-
mary reasons for cost increases to GFOQ renovation projects. Un-
planned repairs, such as for termite damage or unexpected historic
preservation requirements, had occurred because problems were
not identified during home inspections.
The committee remains concerned about unforeseen maintenance
of GFOQs. Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States to assess the following: (1) The policies,
process, and procedures for maintaining GFOQs; (2) The extent to
which the military services effectively plan for major repairs and
manage requests for changes to these homes while balancing other
maintenance installation priorities; (3) The primary factors that
have contributed to cost increases for GFOQ maintenance and to
what extent the DOD has assessed the causes of the cost increases;
and (4) Any other matters the Comptroller General determines ap-
propriate related to this topic.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives on preliminary find-
ings from this assessment, by not later than March 1, 2026, and
determine a mutually agreed upon timeframe to communicate the
final results.
Coordination of advanced nuclear efforts

Defense (DOD) to invest in advanced nuclear capability and en-
courages endeavors to bring those efforts into strategic alignment.

lic of China and the Russian Federation, have recognized the criti-
cality of civil nuclear energy. As a result, they are investing vast
state resources in developing and deploying the next generation of
nuclear reactors while actively pursuing long-term global contracts
for nuclear energy. The committee believes it is critical that the
DOD leads in the development and deployment of nuclear reactors
to prevent our adversaries from monopolizing control of related
supply chains, both to prevent adversaries from achieving such geo-
political leverage and to ensure that our own critical infrastructure
is not dependent on adversary technology. The DOD faces unprece-
dented power needs and will need civil nuclear technology to en-
sure agile, resilient, secure, and uninterrupted power to critical
missions and to military installations and operations, in particular
in austere and unique environments. The DOD must act swiftly
both to secure its own military installations and to ensure the DOD
leads in the development and deployment of civil nuclear tech-
nology.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the
Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not later than Novem-
ber 1, 2026, to brief the congressional defense committees on op-
tions for establishing and executing an advanced nuclear energy
technical project support program of record. At a minimum, the
briefing should include: (1) The likely use cases for advanced nu-
clear energy, including micro-reactors, with coordinated input from
combatant commands to establish operational and installation
needs, including the support of force electrification, base
sustainment, elimination of fuel supply vulnerabilities, addressing
climate threats, enabling multi-domain operations, and advanced
weaponry, at the secret level; (2) The process for establishing re-
quirements for a program of record; (3) The estimated minimum
number of units needed to establish a cost-effective program and
minimize the time to Initial Operational Capability; (4) The max-
imum number of units with assumptions on which operational
plans are in effect; (5) The process for establishing a comprehensive
regulatory framework for DOD-managed advanced reactors and the
deployment of pilot nuclear reactors for installations; (6) Estimates
on fuel requirements to support deployment models; and (7) The
expected annual budget required to transition the Project Pele
demonstration, as well as programmatic budget needs for the pro-
gram of record through 2030 or through the first 5 years in which
advanced nuclear energy, including micro-reactors, is deployed for
operational and installation energy, whichever is longer.
Feasibility study on potential land use of Pentagon Reserva-
tion
The committee notes that in May 2024 the National Capital
Planning Commission approved a Pentagon Reservation master
plan update, outlining proposed improvements to the Pentagon and
nearby Department of Defense (DOD) property. Among the ele-
ments of this plan is the potential reuse of some DOD land adja-
cent to Pentagon City, Virginia. The revised master plan, in ele-
ment 3.5.4, identifies this land for future development under

mixed-use or supportive purposes, saying it should be, ‘‘considered
for land use types that provide a more positive impact than surface
parking.’’ It also notes that the ‘‘economic development dynamics of
Pentagon City along with the potential benefits to the Pentagon
suggest strongly that further study of this area should be con-
ducted to identify the most appropriate use for these sites.’’ Given
security and financial suitability needs, the plan states that ‘‘fur-
ther study of this area should be conducted to identify the most ap-
propriate use for these sites.’’
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives a one-time briefing, not later than March
1, 2026, on the potential use of DOD land adjacent to the Pentagon
Reservation fronting Army Navy Drive in Arlington, Virginia, cur-
rently being used as parking lots. The briefing should reflect the
contents of element 3.5.4 of the 2024 Pentagon Reservation master
plan update and balance the needs of sound fiscal planning, secu-
rity, sustainable land use, and military families. Lastly, the brief-
ing should identify next steps and associated funding requirements.
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning replacement at
Luke Air Force Base
The committee understands that Luke Air Force Base (AFB) re-
quires upgraded heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
systems. The committee notes that, due to the Air Force’s inability
to properly budget for facility sustainment funding, HVAC systems
across Luke AFB are aged and now need replacement. The com-
mittee understands that temperatures in the Phoenix, Arizona,
area, also known as ‘‘America’s Hottest City,’’ can approach 120 de-
grees Fahrenheit. The committee notes that operating older, less
efficient HVAC systems in areas experiencing extreme heat may
result in higher operating and maintenance costs. The committee
is concerned that this poses a safety and readiness issue—impact-
ing airmen’s ability to work effectively in high heat—and a fiscal
inefficiency.
Accordingly, the committee urges the Secretary of the Air Force
to include appropriate funds when planning the Air Force’s budget
for fiscal year 2027.
Impacts to energy and water utilities on military installa-
tions
The committee notes that Department of Defense (DOD) installa-
tions need to be resilient against extreme weather events and chal-
lenges. The committee further notes that military installations
need to ensure that basic functions remain operational so the pri-
mary mission of the installation is not under threat from interrup-
tion of energy and water utilities. The DOD needs to be able to bet-
ter understand in detail the exposure their facilities have to ex-
treme weather events and how the impacts of such events may
limit military operations, pose risk to DOD utilities, and under-
mine readiness.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
coordination with the Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, to
provide a one-time briefing to the committee, not later than March

1, 2026, on the potential risk exposure of water and energy utilities
at military installations in the Indo-Pacific as a result of extreme
weather events. The briefing should include: (1) A categorized list
of incidents or malfunctions that led to a major disruption of water
or energy services as a result of extreme weather and impeded the
utilities at installations from functioning properly; (2) An assess-
ment of military installations in the Indo-Pacific that are at risk
of energy and water utility disruptions due extreme weather events
and mitigating actions those installations took to reduce this risk;
(3) A list of DOD policies and statutes that inhibit installation com-
manders’ ability to better prepare and develop military installation
resilience strategies to address the vulnerability of water and en-
ergy utilities to extreme weather events; and (4) An assessment of
how the design of water and energy utility infrastructure on DOD
installations is being adjusted to account for extreme weather
events.
Implementation of increased architecture and engineering
design fee limitation
The committee notes that the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) raised the architec-
ture and engineering (A&E) design fee limit from 6 percent to 10
percent of estimated construction costs for Department of Defense
projects. While Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
48 Code of Federal Regulations part 236 was amended on June 27,
2024, implementation has been inconsistent, with some contracting
officers unaware of the update. This lack of awareness has led to
delays and hindered firms from fully benefiting from the revised
limitation. To ensure full implementation, the Secretary of Defense
should issue acquisition, program objective memoranda, and budget
guidance to all services to ensure consistent application of the new
fee limitation, reflect the revised fee limit in future budgets, and
train contracting officers and acquisition personnel on compliance.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, not later than December 1, 2025, on the De-
partment’s efforts to ensure full implementation of this change.
Infrastructure support for the 185th Air Refueling Wing
The committee remains concerned about infrastructure limita-
tions affecting the operational readiness of the 185th Air Refueling
Wing (ARW), a critical National Guard unit supporting global aer-
ial refueling missions. Located at a dual-use facility not owned by
the Department of Defense, the 185th ARW relies on non-federal
infrastructure for mission execution. These limitations have re-
stricted the Department’s ability to invest in necessary upgrades to
sustain readiness and future mission requirements.
The Department has historically faced challenges in using mili-
tary construction funds to support infrastructure it does not di-
rectly own. However, the 185th ARW’s reliance on such facilities
presents a unique case where readiness and strategic capacity may
be weakened without targeted investment and coordination. Pro-
grams such as the Defense Community Infrastructure Program

(DCIP), cooperative agreements, or other legal authorities may
offer pathways for resolving these infrastructure gaps.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than April 1, 2026, on
the Department’s plan to: (1) Preserve the operational readiness of
the 185th ARW, including support for current and projected mis-
sion requirements; (2) Identify infrastructure challenges associated
with the unit’s reliance on non-federally owned facilities; (3) Assess
available legal authorities and potential legislative changes that
would enable the Department to contribute to infrastructure mod-
ernization efforts, including the use of programs such as the DCIP;
(4) Describe any current or planned mitigation efforts, such as
partnerships with state or local governments; and (5) Provide rec-
ommendations for congressional action.
Installation energy demands in Indo-Pacific
The committee notes the energy demands of operating in a for-
ward environment not only in peacetime but especially in a con-
tested environment. The committee notes that if the Department of
Defense (DOD) assessed potential opportunities to partner with key
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to develop geothermal en-
ergy, it could help meet its growing energy demands and provide
crucial information for future infrastructure planning.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a one-time briefing to the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee, not later than March 1, 2026, with an assessment of oppor-
tunities for the DOD to develop geothermal energy across the Indo-
Pacific that could increase deterrence, promote energy and national
security, and boost exports of U.S. technologies. The briefing should
include: (1) An assessment of countries and regions in the Indo-Pa-
cific in which the development or expansion of geothermal energy
is most beneficial to the DOD’s security interests, including in sup-
port of U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy, and most feasible based on fac-
tors such as existing geothermal production or exploration, sub-
surface data, regulatory and economic conditions, energy demand,
and workforce quality; (2) An assessment of the benefits of addi-
tional geothermal production on military installations that could
improve energy reliability, affordability, security, and reduced reli-
ance on adversaries; (3) An assessment of the barriers to the devel-
opment and expansion of geothermal energy on military installa-
tions; (4) An assessment of the potential for the DOD’s competitive
advantage in the development and export of next-generation geo-
thermal technologies; and (5) A recommendation for whether to es-
tablish a pilot program for the DOD to promote geothermal energy
internationally and the resources necessary for such a program.
Integrated project delivery
The committee is concerned that the military services have not
incorporated best practices from the private sector into military
construction (MILCON) projects. Section 2814 of the James M.
Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023
(Public Law 117–263) required the Secretary of the Army, the Sec-
retary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force to each enter

into at least one integrated project delivery project. The committee
has not received any information to indicate the military services
complied with this requirement.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Naval Facilities Engi-
neering Systems Command commissioned a study and report by a
third-party to determine the MILCON Cost Premium and under-
lying cost drivers, which was published on April 28, 2025. The
study concluded that there is a significant cost premium associated
with military construction when compared to private sector con-
struction of similar facilities. The study included several rec-
ommendations to reduce the MILCON cost premium, among which
was the adoption of best practices from the private sector, includ-
ing the use of integrated project delivery that uses open-book pric-
ing, enhanced collaboration, and the use of an integrated project
team. The committee agrees that increasing collaboration and shar-
ing of risk and rewards could contribute to the on-time and on-
budget delivery of MILCON projects.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment to provide a briefing to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than March 1, 2026, on the
feasibility and advisability of using integrated project delivery for
MILCON projects, to include:
(1) A comprehensive list of any legal or regulatory barriers
to the use of integrated project delivery, including associated
waiver authorities;
(2) A strategy for training the workforce for awarding and
managing construction employing integrated project delivery;
(3) A detailed explanation of the challenges and opportuni-
ties of using integrated project delivery; and
(4) An explanation for the Department of Defense’s failure to
comply with section 2814 of the James M. Inhofe National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.
Intergovernmental service agreements for unaccompanied
housing
The committee notes that the Department of Defense continues
to face challenges meeting unaccompanied housing needs across
the services, especially in regions with high concentrations of
servicemembers. The committee is aware of proposals to use Inter-
governmental Service Agreements (IGSAs) to lease unaccompanied
housing units. The committee believes that this approach could
provide additional unaccompanied housing options, increasing sup-
ply faster than traditional methods.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,
Installations, and Environment, to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, not later than March 1, 2026. The briefing shall in-
clude but not be limited to:
(1) The viability of using IGSAs to lease unaccompanied
housing;
(2) Funding models, to include the use of basic allowance for
housing funds to fund the leases;

(3) A sample of military installations that could benefit from
this model; and
(4) Any scoring implications that would hinder congressional
action for a future pilot authority.
Mold kits
The committee believes that it is essential for the Department of
Defense to continue to examine and improve quality-of-life initia-
tives for our servicemembers. Specifically, as it relates to housing
under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, the committee
is concerned regarding ongoing reports of mold inside housing
owned and operated by private contractors.
Accordingly, the committee strongly encourages the Board of Di-
rectors for each service exchange system to maintain ready stock
at all locations, where feasible and consistent with operational ca-
pabilities, of at-home environmental testing kits. These kits should
enable military families to detect and identify potential health haz-
ards in housing environments. The Secretary of Defense shall pro-
vide a written report to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 1, 2026, that includes, at a minimum:
(1) The percentage of military exchange locations carrying
at-home environmental testing kits by product type;
(2) A list of military exchange locations selling these kits;
(3) A plan to keep the kits readily available at military ex-
changes; and
(4) Any challenges or costs associated with maintaining at-
home environmental testing kits.
Requirement for Camp Navajo entry bridge repairs
The committee notes that in the event of a conflict, it is critical
to have reliable access to munitions in storage and the ability to
expediently ship munitions. The committee acknowledges that the
transport of munitions often relies on rail transportation to expedi-
tiously move munitions from the interior of the United States to
munition ports to be shipped outside the contiguous United States
to the theater of operations.
The committee acknowledges that properly maintaining the in-
frastructure, such as bridges and overpasses, at military installa-
tions operating munitions storage missions along the Strategic Rail
Corridor Network, including Camp Navajo in Bellemont, Arizona,
is important for our national security. However, the condition and
size of the current bridge limits the portion of the strategic na-
tional rail line underneath the overpass to one lane of travel, cre-
ating a limiting factor to support contingencies, logistics, and re-
supply in the Indo-Pacific area of responsibility.
Accordingly, the committee urges the U.S. Army and the U.S.
Army National Guard to prioritize military construction and
sustainment funding to replace and sustain the bridge network
contained within the Department of Defense’s jurisdiction.

threaten to destroy traditional wood or concrete utility poles, leav-
ing military installations without power and unable to accomplish
basic functions. However, composite utility poles capable of with-
standing the effects of extreme weather could offer a more resilient
and cost-effective alternative over the long term.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
conduct an assessment and provide a one-time briefing to the com-
mittee, not later than March 1, 2026, to identify Department of De-
fense locations where modular composite utility poles will improve
grid resilience, reduce pole failures, and decrease life-cycle costs
compared to traditional wood utility poles. The assessment and
briefing should include the identification of locations on military in-
stallations that have experienced utility pole failures and electrical
outages due to excessive ice loading, hurricane-force winds, or
wildfires. Lastly, the assessment and briefing should include the
consideration of environmental moisture, such as from swamps and
wetlands, and wildlife interference and corruption as additional
factors in assessing electrical equipment failure.
Yuma Proving Ground
The committee is aware of the substandard conditions of Pole
Line Road, an interior test road running through Yuma Proving
Ground. The committee wishes to underscore the importance of
maintaining road safety, in particular on testing grounds, where
personnel often operate in small teams and maneuver critical and
expensive testing equipment.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
conduct an estimate cost analysis to repair the existing Pole Line
Road and an estimate cost analysis to replace Pole Line Road. Cost
estimates and analyses should include impacts to the status quo
and further road degradation on mission success and personnel
safety. The committee further directs the U.S. Army to provide a
one-time briefing to the committee, not later than March 1, 2026,
on the results of these cost analyses.

the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah River Plu-
tonium Processing Facility.
The committee recognizes that dramatic shifts in the inter-
national security environment have compelled the Department of
Defense to reassess anticipated nuclear weapons stockpile require-
ments, which are likely to levy additional production needs on the
nuclear security enterprise beyond the original targets established
in 2015. As such, the committee acknowledges that the 80 pits per
year production target is likely insufficient to facilitate timely mod-
ernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile in a manner that
preserves deterrence against growing threats from China, Russia,
and North Korea. In order to effectively establish realistic targets
within this legislative cycle, the Congress requires updated assess-
ments of projected annual production rate requirements for pluto-
nium pits. These assessments will inform conference negotiations
for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, act-
ing through the Chair of the Nuclear Weapons Council, to brief the
congressional defense committees on the results of an updated an-
nual, full-rate production target for plutonium pits, encompassing
both the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah River

Items of Special Interest
Accelerating cleanup milestones at Los Alamos National
Laboratory
The committee notes that Los Alamos National Laboratory has
long-standing sub-surface ground water contamination issues, asso-
ciated with chromium and explosives testing, that will take decades
to remediate.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Energy to brief
the congressional defense committees, not later than March 31,
2026, on recommended actions that can be taken to accelerate
cleanup milestones with the State of New Mexico at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, including chromium plume control interim
measures to control migration of a hexavalent chromium plume

tion Explosive (RDX) plume in Can˜on de Valle.
Briefing on Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program
The committee remains concerned about the proliferation of nu-
clear and radiological materials.
Therefore, the committee directs the National Nuclear Security
Administration’s Administrator for Nuclear Security, not later than
June 1, 2026, to provide a one-time briefing to the congressional
defense committees on developments in the global security environ-
ment over the past 18 months regarding: (1) Persistent threats of
state and non-state actors seeking to obtain nuclear and radio-
logical materials; (2) State actors potentially undermining non-
proliferation regimes and arms control agreements to which the
United States is adherent; and (3) Increased risks of the avail-

Briefing on feasibility of public-private partnerships to sup-
port modernization of National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration high-yield experimentation capabilities
The committee notes that the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration’s (NNSA) high-yield experimentation capabilities, like
much of the NNSA’s infrastructure, is in need of modernization to
meet the needs of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and ensure
the NNSA retains a robust scientific base across all disciplines re-
lating to high-energy physics. To alleviate continually increasing
fiscal and programmatic pressures on the NNSA and its workforce,
the committee believes that innovative approaches to developing
and resourcing future capabilities should be explored.
Therefore, the committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear
Security to provide the congressional defense committees with a
one-time briefing, not later than November 1, 2025, on the feasi-
bility of initiating a program to update existing high-yield experi-
mentation facilities or build replacement facilities through the use
of public-private partnerships. The briefing should address, at a
minimum: (1) An assessment of the capability of potential private
industry partners to effectively contribute to the modernization of
NNSA high-yield experimentation capabilities; (2) A review of ex-
isting statutory authorities for conducting a public-private partner-
ship for such purposes; (3) An evaluation of possible siting options
for the construction of new facilities, as necessary; and (4) An ini-
tial cost and schedule projection for recapitalizing existing facilities
or constructing new facilities.
Comptroller General review of Defense Nuclear Non-
proliferation legacy nuclear security programs
The committee notes that following the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the Department of Energy initiated a range of cooperative
nuclear and radiological material security programs with Russia
and the other former Soviet states. Among other things, these ef-
forts included programs to improve the security of facilities with
weapon-usable nuclear materials and radiological sources, to re-
move or consolidate materials to fewer locations, and to detect and
interdict smuggling of materials across borders. Following the es-
tablishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration
(NNSA) in 2000 and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
these efforts were expanded on a global scale. Significant progress
was made over the past two decades to reduce nuclear and radio-
logical risks worldwide.
Given this progress, the committee would like more information
about whether the significant amount of funding that is still dedi-
cated every year to these efforts under the NNSA’s Office of De-
fense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) is being expended commen-
surate with the remaining risks posed by poorly secured fissile ma-
terials. Specifically, the committee seeks to understand whether
these ‘‘legacy’’ programs may now be generally addressing lower-
value materials or facilities and working with countries that may
pose less urgent or direct nuclear security and proliferation risks

to the United States. Furthermore, the committee seeks to under-
stand whether current programs are flexible enough to address
new risks as they emerge.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess, for each DNN program identified, includ-
ing those within the DNN offices of Global Material Security and
Material Management and Minimization: (1) The range of activities
implemented by the program and the countries in which the pro-
gram operates or is planning to operate; (2) Outcomes defined by
the program, the national security benefits of those outcomes, and
how the program measures progress toward the outcomes; (3)
Funding levels for the program, including carryover funds; (4) The
scope of work remaining in the program, and the projected timeline
and cost for completion of the work; and (5) The extent to which
current program design is sufficiently flexible to respond to emerg-
ing global risks.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than February 1, 2026, with final results to
follow in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration construction project cost drivers
The committee notes that in recent years, the National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) has experienced significant cost
growth in its portfolio of capital asset acquisitions. The committee
is seeking to understand the drivers of cost across this portfolio,
both in terms of baseline costs as well as cost growth. For example,
the committee has learned of significant differences in the con-
struction cost per square foot of facilities built by NNSA manage-
ment and operating contractors as compared to the private sector
and would like to better understand what drives these differences.
Similarly, the committee has learned of quality assurance problems
on nuclear construction that have contributed to costly rework.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess the factors that contribute to the signifi-
cant costs of construction in the nuclear security enterprise. The
committee further directs the Comptroller General to provide a
one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to
the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon
date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a
mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration’s artificial intelligence and machine
learning strategy
The committee notes that modeling and simulating the com-
plexity of nuclear weapons systems is essential to maintaining con-
fidence in the performance of the stockpile without underground
nuclear explosive testing. The committee notes that artificial intel-
ligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies have the poten-
tial to transform how the nuclear enterprise uses computer models
and simulation to evaluate, design, certify, and qualify the stock-

pile and to dramatically reduce the time to execute stockpile stew-
ardship and modernization. Applying AI/ML in the nuclear enter-
prise also presents unique challenges, given the high-security and
high-consequence environment in which the National Nuclear Se-
curity Administration (NNSA) and nuclear security laboratories op-
erate. These challenges include limited or sparse data sets, tight
constraints on model correctness driven by the high consequence of
error, and the complexity of the computer codes needed to simulate
nuclear weapons.
The committee understands that in 2023, the NNSA’s Advanced
Simulation and Computing program developed an AI/ML strategy,
called AI for Nuclear Deterrence (AI4ND), to develop and deploy
technologies and computing capabilities that can effectively lever-
age AI for stockpile stewardship. The committee seeks to enhance
its understanding of this strategy.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The NNSA’s efforts to address data,
modeling, and other challenges to adopting AI/ML to stockpile
stewardship and modernization; (2) The resources the NNSA has
identified as needed to achieve the goals of the AI4ND strategy;
and (3) The risks and opportunities of collaborating through part-
nerships with industry, academia, and across the Federal Govern-
ment on AI/ML.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than March 31, 2026, with final results to fol-
low in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration’s federal program and project manager
responsibilities
The committee notes that the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration’s (NNSA) effort to modernize the nuclear security enter-
prise will cost billions of dollars over the next two decades and in-
volve multiple complex programs and supporting projects that must
be effectively integrated. For example, the committee notes that
NNSA’s effort to establish a modern pit production capability—one
of the most complex and potentially costly of NNSA’s moderniza-
tion efforts—encompasses a broad range of program activities, six
major capital asset projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and
the Savannah River Site, and other activities. NNSA has struggled
to mitigate the risks of uncontrolled changes to scope, cost, and
schedule and to meet production program and project goals. The
committee is aware that NNSA program and project managers are
concerned that they may lack appropriate authority to direct con-
tractors’ work, control budgetary resources, accept project and pro-
gram risk, and be supported by a sufficient and well-trained federal
team—all key features of effective program and project manage-
ment. The committee notes that recent NNSA personnel reductions
may complicate these efforts.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The NNSA’s federal program and
project manager responsibilities, including their authorities and re-

sponsibilities in the NNSA and the ability of these managers to ef-
fectively execute them; and (2) Federal staffing for the production
modernization programs and their associated projects, which were
previously assessed in a July 2024 Government Accountability Of-
fice report, titled ‘‘National Nuclear Security Administration: Ac-
tions Needed to Improve Integration of Production Modernization
Programs and Projects’’ (GAO–24–106342).
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than April 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration’s Office of Cost Estimating and Program
Evaluation
The committee notes that in 2013, the Office of Cost Estimating
and Program Evaluation (CEPE) was established by statute within
the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to provide
unbiased analysis in support of decision-making on projects, pro-
grams, and portfolios. The committee believes that this was a capa-
bility the NNSA lacked. CEPE’s responsibilities have grown over
the years, and the NNSA is undertaking a massive and challenging
nuclear modernization effort. The committee understands that this
moment has been described as the busiest the NNSA has been
since the Cold War. The committee would like to understand
whether CEPE has the capacity to fulfill its responsibilities and
keep pace with modernization efforts.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The extent of CEPE’s various respon-
sibilities and how they have changed over time; and (2) Any chal-
lenges to CEPE’s ability to fulfill its responsibilities, the independ-
ence of its evaluations, or the implementation of the results of its
analyses.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of Office of Environmental
Management efforts to optimize cleanup activities
The committee notes that the Department of Energy’s Office of
Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for cleaning up
sites and facilities contaminated by decades of nuclear weapons
production and nuclear energy research. The committee under-
stands that EM’s most costly responsibilities involve tank waste
management and the deactivation and decommissioning of excess
facilities. The agency regularly makes choices among options for
cleaning up and disposing of radioactive waste that have different
costs, limitations, and risks.
The committee notes that in a September 2024 report, the U.S.
Government Accountability Office (GAO) developed a hypothetical
optimization model to serve as an example of how EM could poten-

tially optimize nuclear waste disposal decisions, which could in
turn achieve cleanup sooner, decrease costs, and reduce risks
(‘‘Hanford Cleanup: Alternatives for Treating and Disposing of
High-Level Waste Could Save Billions of Dollars and Reduce Cer-
tain Risks’’ (GAO–24–106989)). However, GAO reported in April
2025 that EM is not taking steps to optimize the disposal sequenc-
ing of its nuclear waste (‘‘Priority Open Recommendations: Depart-
ment of Energy’’ (GAO–25–108093)). The committee notes that it is
unclear to what extent EM is optimizing the sequencing of cleanup
activities—including tank waste cleanup activities and deactivation
and decommissioning efforts—within and across its sites.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess opportunities to optimize EM nuclear waste
cleanup and disposal and deactivation and decommissioning efforts.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to coordi-
nate with the congressional defense committees to determine which
waste streams or cleanup efforts to review and to provide a one-
time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to the
congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon date,
not later than March 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a mu-
tually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of Office of Environmental
Management’s fraud risk management for contracts and
subcontracts
The committee notes that, as one of the largest contracting agen-
cies in the federal government outside of the Department of De-
fense, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Environmental
Management (EM) relies primarily on contractors to carry out its
diverse missions and operate its laboratories and other facilities,
spending approximately 90 percent of its annual budget on con-
tracts. In fiscal year 2025, $8.0 billion of that annual budget will
be spent on nuclear waste cleanup activities across the country.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the DOE’s
Office of Inspector General have identified multiple contracting
fraud risks and reported on incidents of fraudulent activity by the
DOE’s contractors and subcontractors. The committee notes that
GAO first designated aspects of the DOE’s contract management as
high-risk areas for the Government in 1990 because its record of
inadequate management and oversight of contractors left the DOE
vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. As of 2025,
EM’s acquisition and program management remain on GAO’s High-
Risk List.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess EM’s fraud risk management efforts with
respect to contracts and subcontracts, including assessments of pos-
sible: (1) Conflicts of interest; (2) Bid rigging; (3) Small business
fraud; and (4) Overpayments. The committee further directs the
Comptroller General to provide a one-time preliminary briefing on
the results of its assessment to the congressional defense commit-
tees at a mutually agreed upon date, not later than March 1, 2026,
with final results to follow in a mutually agreed upon format and
timeframe.

Comptroller General review of options for grouting low-ac-
tivity waste at the Hanford Site
The committee notes that the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Of-
fice of Environmental Management’s (EM) most expensive cleanup
project is located at the Hanford Site in Washington State and in-
volves the treatment and immobilization of radioactive and haz-
ardous tank waste. The committee understands that in 2024, EM
announced plans to grout 2,000 gallons of low-activity tank waste
for off-site disposal as a part of EM’s Test Bed Initiative. Addition-
ally, pursuant to a recently finalized holistic agreement among the
Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and
the State of Washington, EM now plans to complete retrieval of 22
tanks in Hanford’s southwest tank farms by 2040. The committee
understands that the low-activity portion of this waste would be
grouted and disposed of off-site. However, DOE has not yet decided
where this waste will be grouted, and some stakeholders have
raised concerns about EM’s plans to transport this waste.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The status of EM’s Test Bed Initiative;
(2) The on-site and off-site options EM has considered for grouting
Hanford’s low-activity waste; and (3) The benefits and drawbacks
of on-site versus off-site treatment prior to disposal.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than March 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of status of Idaho National Lab-
oratory’s defense nuclear waste treatment
The committee notes that the Department of Energy’s Office of
Environmental Management (EM) began operating the Integrated
Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) at Idaho National Laboratory in
April 2023, after a nearly $1.0 billion cost overrun and 10-year
delay. The facility is designed to treat 772,000 gallons of sodium-
bearing waste, a liquid waste that EM currently manages as high-
level radioactive waste. Idaho National Laboratory also stores ap-
proximately 4,400 cubic meters of dried granular calcine waste,
stored in six stainless steel bin sets, but it does not yet have plans
for how it will treat or dispose of this waste. EM likewise currently
manages the calcine waste at Idaho National Lab as high-level ra-
dioactive waste.
The committee notes that since beginning operations in 2023, the
IWTU has faced ongoing issues, raising questions about the reli-
ability and operability of the facility. For example, the facility was
shut down in September 2023 so that staff could replace media in
its granular activated carbon beds. The media removes mercury
from the gas by-product of the waste treatment process. EM offi-
cials estimated that the facility would restart operations in Janu-
ary 2024. However, when attempting to restart in March 2024,
crews identified abnormal conditions, causing EM to further sus-
pend start-up activities; the facility ultimately restarted in Sep-
tember 2024. The facility again shut down for 2 weeks in January
2025 to address a clogged feed line. In February 2025, Idaho offi-

cials announced that the facility would shut down for an additional
4 months to replace a carbon bed and perform other maintenance.
The committee understands that, in addition, EM has not yet de-
termined how it will dispose of the immobilized waste treated by
the IWTU. EM has considered disposing it as transuranic waste at
the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico but will need to
overcome legal and regulatory barriers before doing so. Moreover,
the waste reportedly may need further treatment with vitrification
if it cannot be disposed of as transuranic waste.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The steps EM is taking to address tech-
nical issues it has encountered and the impacts of the technical
issues on its treatment efforts; (2) The extent to which EM holds
its contractors accountable for continued issues facing the IWTU;
and (3) EM’s plans for treating and disposing of the sodium-bearing
and calcine waste at Idaho National Laboratory.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than March 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of the transportation of defense
radiological materials
The committee notes that the Department of Energy’s Office of
Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for cleaning up
sites and facilities contaminated by decades of nuclear weapons
production and nuclear energy research. Much of this waste is dis-
posed of at off-site disposal facilities. The committee further notes
that, in recent years, communities along transportation paths have
voiced concerns about radiological materials being transported
through or near these communities, and, in some cases, municipali-
ties have banned such transport.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The steps EM takes to ensure the safe
packaging and transportation of radiological and hazardous mate-
rials; (2) How EM engages with stakeholders and communities
along transportation routes; and (3) The lessons EM can learn from
other entities that package and transport radiological and haz-
ardous materials.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees on the status of its
review at a mutually agreed upon date, not later than March 1,
2026, with final results to follow in a mutually agreed upon format

half to include more rigorous project management requirements
that reflect best practices. Despite these more rigorous expecta-
tions, NNSA’s project performance is declining, and NNSA is in-
creasingly seeking to obtain capital assets through means other
than projects executed under Order 413.3B or is seeking waivers
to the order’s requirements. The committee recognizes that the way
NNSA has elected to implement Order 413.3B requirements may
be onerous, and the committee would like to better understand
what opportunities for improvement exist while still ensuring that
projects are managed consistent with best practices. Further, the
committee is seeking to better understand alternative means of ac-
quiring capital assets.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The extent to which DOE Order 413.3B
reflects best practices in project management and NNSA’s ap-
proach to implementing the order’s requirements; (2) Any opportu-
nities that may exist to streamline or improve NNSA’s implementa-
tion approach, particularly with respect to improving projects’
schedule performance; and (3) Whether the alternative means
NNSA has pursued to acquiring capital assets have proved bene-
ficial with respect to schedule performance and risk management.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than April 30, 2026, with final results to follow

Rendija Canyon land study
The committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear Security to
conduct a study of portions of Tract A–14 (Rendija Canyon) that

means subtracts that have been identified by the National Nuclear
Security Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, that meet the requirements for conveyance under the
Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and
Related Agencies Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–119), that require
minimal remediation, and that will meet the requirements for con-
veyance of the Department of Energy Order 458.1, ‘‘Radiation Pro-
tection of the Public and the Environment,’’ and the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91–190). The committee
further directs the Administrator to brief the congressional defense
committees with the results of the study immediately upon its com-
pletion, not later than March 31, 2026.

The committee understands that at PULSE, formerly known as the
U1a Complex, scientists conduct subcritical and physics experi-
ments to obtain technical information about the U.S. nuclear weap-
ons stockpile. In particular, PULSE is undergoing a major con-
struction project that will enable it to conduct Enhanced Capabili-

ties for Subcritical Experiments (ECSE), which will host two of the
most capable weapons radiographic systems in the world, the
ZEUS and Scorpius test beds. Both are critical components in ef-
forts to assess pit design as the NNSA begins to produce pits at
scale at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah
River Site. Further, the committee understands that the NNSA is
now incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in weapons design to
integrate the data from over 1,000 above- and below-ground tests
to interpolate and extend design parameters outside the existing
testing envelope and parameter database.
Therefore, the committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear
Security, not later than March 1, 2026, to provide a one-time brief-
ing to the congressional defense committees on:
(1) How the combined initiatives of using AI in weapons de-
sign, pit production, and ECSE could provide greater certainty
on warhead performance as compared to current weapons de-
sign process; and
(2) The estimated costs and length of preparation time re-
quired to conduct a full scale nuclear explosive test should a
determination be made that such a test is required to ensure
the safety, reliability, performance, or military effectiveness of
a weapon in the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.
Report on commercially available counter unmanned aerial
systems
Continued advances in commercially available artificial intel-
ligence, computer vision, and sensor fusion capabilities could help
meet the growing threat that unmanned aerial systems (UAS) pose
to critical infrastructure and secure sites, including Department of
Energy installations. The committee remains supportive of the Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) efforts to leverage
commercially available software and hardware technology to detect
ground and aerial intrusions and advanced defeat capabilities to
combat the UAS threat. Following a review of its security require-
ments, NNSA implemented a pilot program leveraging these com-
mercial technologies to combat the UAS threat.
The committee is encouraged by the Department of Energy’s in-
novative approach, which provides for the rapid deployment of
leading commercial technology to improve security while reducing
overall costs. The committee also supports NNSA’s efforts to transi-
tion its successful pilot to a family of systems program of record
and expand deployment of this technology to additional sites across
the NNSA complex as part of its future years nuclear security pro-
gram.
The committee directs the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security
and Administrator, NNSA, to provide a briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than December 13, 2025, regarding the expansion of this
program and transition to a family of systems program of record,
including associated resource requirements and timelines to deploy
these commercially available capabilities across the national secu-
rity enterprise.

Satellite facility long-term leasing
The committee recognizes that authorizing the National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) to purchase options for future
purchasing or leasing of real property provides benefits to the
NNSA in long-term infrastructure planning. The committee be-
lieves this authority has been particularly helpful in cost-effectively
expediting the expansion and modernization of the Kansas City
National Security Campus to meet increasing production demands
for the nuclear security enterprise (NSE). The committee under-
stands that expanded use of such authorities could benefit other lo-
cations within the NSE that require significant infrastructure up-
grades, particularly in such cases where selected supporting facili-
ties could be relocated outside protected areas to reduce cost and
unnecessary administrative burdens. Such evolutions in long-term
installation capability planning will be key to efficiently and cost
effectively managing the operation of NNSA-supporting facilities
over the coming decades, and the committee strongly recommends
that the NNSA maximize the use of this authority in the develop-
ment of site strategies across the NSE.
Therefore, the committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear
Security, in consultation with the Directors of Los Alamos, Law-
rence Livermore, and Sandia National Laboratories and the Site
Managers of the Y–12 National Security Complex, the Savannah
River Site, the Pantex Plant, the Nevada National Security Site,
and the Kansas City National Security Campus, to provide a one-
time briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later
than May 1, 2026, on site strategies across the NSE. The briefing
should include the identification of opportunities for expanding the
use of the authorities provided by Section 3265 of the National Nu-
clear Security Administration Act (section 2466 of title 50, United
States Code) and any recommendations for additional authorities
that might aid the NNSA in making greater use of satellite facili-
ties in areas neighboring laboratory and site installations.
Unexploded ordnance from legacy tests near Sandia Na-
tional Laboratories
The committee notes that Cold War-era nuclear weapons tests
have left unexploded ordnance (UXO) across the United States. Al-
though measures have been taken to remediate UXO, the com-
mittee remains concerned that additional remediation efforts may
be needed in lands near the National Nuclear Security Administra-
tion’s (NNSA) Sandia National Laboratories and the adjoining
Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) What UXO remediation efforts NNSA
has completed in the vicinity of Sandia National Laboratories; and
(2) The extent to which additional efforts are needed to ensure that
all affected nearby communities have been cleared of legacy UXO.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than April 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.

DIVISION D—FUNDING TABLES
Sec. 4001—Authorization of amounts in funding tables
The committee recommends a provision that would provide for
the allocation of funds among programs, projects, and activities in
accordance with the tables in division D of this Act, subject to re-
programming in accordance with established procedures.
Consistent with the previously expressed views of the committee,
the provision would also require that decisions by an agency head
to commit, obligate, or expend funds to a specific entity on the
basis of such funding tables be based on authorized, transparent,
and statutory criteria or merit-based selection procedures in ac-
cordance with the requirements of sections 2304(k) and 2374 of
title 10, United States Code, and other applicable provisions of law.

Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate
It was not possible to include the Congressional Budget Office
cost estimate on this legislation because it was not available at the
time the report was filed. It will be included in material presented
during the Senate floor debate on the legislation.
Regulatory Impact
Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate requires that a report on the regulatory impact of the bill be
included in the report on the bill. The committee finds that there
is no regulatory impact in the case of the National Defense Author-
ization Bill for Fiscal Year 2026.
Changes in Existing Law
Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the
Standing Rules of the Senate, the changes in existing law made by
certain portions of the bill have not been shown in this section of
the report because, in the opinion of the committee, it is necessary
to dispense with showing such changes in order to expedite the
business of the Senate and reduce the expenditure of funds.

TO AUTHORIZE APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026 FOR MILITARY
ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND FOR MILITARY
CONSTRUCTION, TO PRESCRIBE MILITARY PERSONNEL STRENGTHS FOR
SUCH FISCAL YEAR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
JULY15, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. WICKER, from the Committee on Armed Services,
submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 2296]
The Committee on Armed Services reports favorably an original
bill (S. 2296) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2026 for
military activities of the Department of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy,
to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and
for other purposes, and recommends that the bill do pass.

COMMITTEE OVERVIEW
Each year, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) au-
thorizes funding levels and provides authorities for the U.S. mili-
tary and other critical defense priorities, ensuring America’s forces
have the training, equipment, and resources they need to carry out
their missions.
On July 9, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 26–1 to
advance the NDAA for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 to the Senate floor.
Today, the United States is operating in the most dangerous
threat environment since World War II. We face an axis of aggres-
sors comprised of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and this
axis operates across multiple theaters. These nations share weap-
ons, resources, and a unifying objective: to dismantle American in-
fluence around the world. While many of the national security chal-
lenges we face resemble those of the past, warfare looks much dif-
ferent today. Technological advances in artificial intelligence, un-
manned technology, hypersonic strike weapons, sixth-generation
aircraft, and space-based weapons are transforming the nature of
modern conflict.
Thankfully, there is broad consensus among Congress, the White
House, the Department of Defense, and key allies about these cur-
rent threats and the need to address them. Recognizing the com-
plexity of today’s geopolitical environment, our nation must take
action toward reindustrialization and work to rebuild the arsenal
of democracy.
To achieve this, we must advance significant reforms to mod-
ernize the Pentagon’s budgeting and acquisition operations. This
bill implements key Pentagon reforms to improve efficiency, un-
leash innovation, and modernize the budget process. Ultimately,
our servicemembers must have the resources they need to carry out
their duties successfully, and the American people deserve oper-
ational efficiency from their government. Both are achievable.
BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF THIS ACT (SEC. 4)
The committee recommends a provision that would require that
the budgetary effects of this Act be determined in accordance with
the procedures established in the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of
2010 (Public Law 111–139).
SUMMARY OF DISCRETIONARY AUTHORIZATIONS AND
BUDGET AUTHORITY IMPLICATION
The administration’s budget request for national defense discre-
tionary programs within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee
on Armed Services for fiscal year 2026 was $848.5 billion for base
Department of Defense (DOD) programs and $33.8 billion for na-
tional security programs in the Department of Energy (DOE).
The committee recommends an overall discretionary authoriza-
tion of $925.8 billion in fiscal year 2026, including $879.3 billion for
base DOD programs, $35.2 billion for national security programs in
the DOE, and $11.3 billion for defense-related activities outside the
jurisdiction of the NDAA.

DIVISION A—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATIONS
TITLE I—PROCUREMENT
Subtitle A—Authorization of Appropriations
Sec. 101—Authorization of appropriations
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize ap-
propriations for procurement activities at the levels identified in
section 4101 of division D of this Act.
Subtitle B—Army Programs
Sec. 111—Strategy for Army tactical wheeled vehicle pro-
gram
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 112(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) to require the Secretary of the
Army to provide an updated tactical wheeled vehicle strategy with
the submission of the President’s budget request for fiscal year

marine program
The committee recommends a provision that would provide pro-
curement authorities for not more than five Columbia-class sub-
marines.
Sec. 122—Procurement authorities for Medium Landing
Ships
The committee recommends a provision that would provide au-
thorities for a block buy of up to 15 Medium Landing Ships to sup-
port testing and experimentation of the Marine Littoral Regiment
formation. The committee notes that this authority may include the
lead ship and follow on commercial or non-developmental ships as
authorized under section 128(b) of the Servicemember Quality of
Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2025 (118–159).

for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 123 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), by extending the prohibition on replac-
ing existing waterborne security barriers with the current barriers.
The provision would require the Secretary of the Navy to submit
a plan to the congressional defense committees, not later than
April 1, 2026, that would: (1) Develop a formal set of requirements
for waterborne barriers; (2) Certify that the requirements exceed
the capability of existing barriers; (3) Produce an acquisition strat-
egy to meet the requirements; and (4) Submit a plan for acquiring
waterborne security barriers using full and open competition. The
provision would require implementation of the plan by September
30, 2027.
Sec. 124—Modification to limitations on Navy medium and
large unmanned surface vessels
The committee recommends a provision that would repeal section
122 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) and replace
it with new requirements.
Sec. 125—Limitation on availability of funds for TAGOS ship
program
The committee recommends a provision that would create a limi-
tation on the availability of funds for the Tactical Auxiliary Gen-
eral Ocean Surveillance (TAGOS) ship program pending the sub-
mission of a report by the Secretary of the Navy on the maturity
of the design for the TAGOS vessels, among other things.
Sec. 126—Limitation on availability of funds relating to am-
phibious warfare ship requirement
The committee recommends a provision that would limit certain
funds for the Secretary of the Navy unless the 30-year shipbuilding
plan for fiscal year 2027 meets the requirement to maintain 31 am-
phibious warfare ships pursuant to section 8062 of title 10, United
States Code. The provision would further limit certain funds for the
Secretary of Defense unless the defense budget materials for fiscal
year 2027 support the same requirement for 31 amphibious war-
fare ships.
Sec. 127—Temporary unavailability of amphibious warfare
ships
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 8062 of title 10, United States Code, to define ‘‘temporarily un-
available’’ to be a ship that has not surpassed its planned mainte-
nance availability by certain margins. Ships that exceed those mar-
gins would no longer count toward filling the requirement to main-
tain 31 amphibious ships.

Subtitle D—Air Force Programs
Sec. 131—B–21 bomber aircraft program accountability mat-
rices
The committee recommends a provision that replaces section 238
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017
(Public Law 114–238) with a new provision to account for advances
in the B–21 program as it advances from engineering to manufac-
turing and production. The provision would direct the Secretary of
the Air Force to submit, beginning with the President’s annual
budget request for fiscal year 2027 and every 180 days after, infor-
mation on B–21 program costs, goals, and program execution to the
congressional defense committees and the Comptroller General of
the United States. The provision would further direct the Comp-
troller General, not less frequently than annually, to review the in-
formation submitted by the Secretary of the Air Force and submit
to the congressional defense committees an assessment of this in-
formation.
Sec. 132—Bomber aircraft force structure and transition
roadmap
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Air Force to submit a comprehensive bomber road-
map, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of
this Act.
The committee supports the Air Force’s continued modernization
of the bomber force to ensure credible long-range strike capabilities
against peer adversaries. This includes transitioning from legacy
platforms to the B–21, modernizing the B–52 to remain operational
through the 2050s, and responsibly divesting the aging B–1 fleet.
The committee is also interested in the Department of the Air
Force’s efforts to more fully integrate the reserve components into
next-generation bomber operations to enhance readiness, increase
operational flexibility, and improve cost-effectiveness.
The committee wants this roadmap to ensure that the Air Force
implements a coherent, phased transition that will maintain global
strike capacity and align with long-term force design and deter-
rence objectives. This roadmap should: (1) Establish the full
timeline for bomber modernization; (2) Identify key decision points
on that timeline; (3) Explain the strategic rationale for platform di-
vestments, capability fielding, and modernization investments
across the bomber fleet; and (4) Specify the planned role of the Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve in the future bomber force.
The committee expects this roadmap to serve as a tool for over-
sight, risk mitigation, and long-term resourcing. The committee
also reiterates its support for the Air Force to acquire and field no
fewer than 100 B–21 aircraft.
Sec. 133—Requirement for an intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance roadmap for the Air Force
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Air Force to submit a comprehensive intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) roadmap to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than 180 days after the date

of enactment of this Act. This roadmap should outline the Air
Force’s strategic vision for ISR across air, space, and cyberspace do-
mains and must include: (1) An assessment of current and pro-
jected ISR requirements, including ISR support to joint and coali-
tion operations; (2) An inventory of existing ISR systems and plat-
forms, including associated capabilities, readiness levels, and ex-
pected service lives; (3) Plans for modernization or divestment of
legacy ISR systems and the rationale for each such decision; (4)
Planned investments in emerging ISR technologies, including arti-
ficial intelligence, autonomy, and space-based capabilities; (5) A
strategy for integrating ISR data into command and control sys-
tems, ensuring interoperability with other services and allied
forces; (6) An assessment of potential capability gaps, risks, and
proposed mitigation strategies; and (7) Implementation timelines
and key milestones over the next 10 fiscal years.
The committee is concerned with the lack of a comprehensive
and unified roadmap for the future of capabilities across the U.S.
Air Force. As global threats evolve and near-peer competitors con-
tinue to invest in advanced ISR technologies, the committee be-
lieves that a clearly articulated strategy is necessary to guide the
Air Force’s ISR investment, divestment, and integration decisions
over the next decade.
The committee expects this report to be submitted in unclassified
form, but the Secretary may include a classified annex as appro-
priate.
Sec. 134—Annual report on Department of Defense unified
datalink strategy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1527 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to require annual reports through 2032
on the Department of Defense’s datalink strategy. These reports
are to include updated implementation timelines for each element
of the strategy outlined in subsection (a)(2) of section 1527, as well
as detailed accounts of both funding and execution efforts planned
or undertaken during the current fiscal year.
The committee continues to emphasize the critical importance of
resilient, interoperable, and secure datalink capabilities as a foun-
dation for Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and
future warfighting concepts. Building on the requirement estab-
lished by section 1527, the committee believes sustained oversight
is essential to ensure the Department achieves measurable
progress toward an integrated and future-ready datalink enter-
prise.
The committee expects these annual reports to provide clear visi-
bility into datalink modernization across platforms, services, and
domains, including efforts to address legacy system integration,
electromagnetic spectrum resilience, software-defined datalinks,
and coalition interoperability.
Sec. 135—Plan for open mission systems of F–35 aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive plan to establish
a government-controlled open mission systems computing environ-

ment for all variants and blocks of the F–35 aircraft operated by
the Department of Defense and to deliver a report describing this
plan to the congressional defense committees, not later than July
1, 2026.
The committee recognizes the strategic imperative of enabling
rapid, secure, and cost-effective modernization of the Department
of Defense’s fifth-generation aircraft, including the F–35. An open
mission systems computing environment that is government-con-
trolled would reduce reliance on proprietary architectures, enhance
joint interoperability, and allow for the rapid integration of ad-
vanced capabilities across platforms.
Sec. 136—Modification of prohibition on retirement of F–15E
aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 9062(l)(1) of title 10, United States Code, by striking ‘‘Sep-
tember 30, 2029’’ and inserting ‘‘September 30, 2027’’ and by strik-
ing ‘‘68 F–15E aircraft’’ and inserting ‘‘34 F–15E aircraft.’’ The pro-
vision would also repeal certain portions of section 150 of the Serv-
icemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
Sec. 137—Prohibition on retirement of A–10 aircraft

Items of Special Interest
Acceleration of Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile Program
The committee supports the Department of the Air Force’s con-
tinued development of hypersonic strike capabilities, including the
Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program. As peer adver-
saries invest heavily in advanced long-range systems, the United
States must ensure timely fielding of survivable, precision-strike
options capable of penetrating integrated air defense systems. The
committee is interested in the Air Force’s plans to accelerate this
timeline where feasible, including steps to ensure industrial base
readiness and early production.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, on the plan to transition the HACM to
production. The briefing must include: (1) Identification of key pro-
gram milestones and funding requirements, by the fiscal year, nec-
essary to deliver tactically relevant quantities of HACM by October
1, 2029; (2) Assessment of opportunities for producibility improve-
ments or capability enhancements that could accelerate the
timeline to initial operational capability; and (3) A description of
industrial facilitization and supply chain investments needed to
support production, including any associated schedule risks or con-
straints.
Acoustic system for passive surveillance
The committee notes that the Army has been testing a multi-
array, non-line-of-sight, passive surveillance system with sensors
that can detect and track acoustic emissions from threat platforms
while rejecting signals from commercial aircraft and other ambient
noise sources. Such a system has broad applications for developing
situational awareness in congested airspaces to identify incursions
of recreational drones or other threats in an operational environ-
ment, such as at joint-use airports.
Therefore, the committee encourages the National Guard Bu-
reau, in consultation with Reserve and Active-Duty partners, to ex-
amine the utility of these systems specifically at joint-use airports
and Combat Readiness Training Centers during military exercises
focused on contingency response operations.
Advanced Combat Engine
The committee is encouraged by the Department of the Army’s
development of a more fuel-efficient, lower-emission, and cost-effi-
cient engine to support Next Generation Combat Vehicles. Based
on the successful demonstrations at Camp Grayling and Yuma
Proving Grounds, the committee expects the Department of the
Army to continue development and then transition to the fielding
of this critical powertrain solution.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-

resentatives on funding requirements and fielding plans to inte-
grate the Advanced Combat Engine into current and next-genera-
tion combat vehicles.
Aeromedical evacuation platform inventory requirements
The committee recognizes the importance of aeromedical evacu-
ation capabilities but is concerned that the Department of the
Army may have insufficient capacity to meet requirements for the
range of missions the Army may be called to support. It is critical
that the Army maintain the right mix of capabilities to meet con-
tingency training, humanitarian assistance, and operations require-
ments.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
detailing the Army’s inventory of aeromedical evacuation platforms
as of the date on which the report is submitted, as well as the pro-
jected inventory of such platforms in 2030. The report shall also in-
clude: (1) The number of HH–60M aircraft in the Army inventory
configured for aeromedical evacuation; (2) The number of UH–60L
or other utility helicopters equipped with an aeromedical evacu-
ation interior; (3) The number of LUH–72 aircraft configured or
used for aeromedical evacuation missions; and (4) The minimum
number of aircraft, by type, required to support: (a) geographic and
functional combatant commanders; (b) contingency operations and
operational plans; (c) defense support to civil authorities and chem-
ical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response force missions;
(d) humanitarian assistance and disaster response missions; and
(e) installation support for garrison emergency medical response
operations.
The report required shall be submitted in unclassified form but
may include a classified annex.
Airborne fire control radars
The committee is aware that the U.S. Air Force and the U.S.
Navy primarily rely on two suppliers to equip fighter aircraft with
fire control radars. These radars allow aircraft to detect, target,
identify, and engage or avoid airborne and ground threats at
tactically significant ranges. United States air dominance is predi-
cated on fielding premier fighters with innovative weapons and
sensors, and this in turn depends on a healthy industrial base.
The committee strongly encourages the Department of Defense to
be cognizant of the radar industrial base implications of pending
tactical air acquisition decisions, including the risk to the engineer-
ing workforce from further program delays, and expects that the
Department would seek to mitigate the implications of any such
delay with appropriate industrial base investment. Further, the
committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial
Base Policy to review the risks to and resilience of the fire control
radar industrial base and provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 31, 2026, with recommendations to mitigate
any identified industrial base risks.

Army aviation transformation
The committee is aware of the Army’s plan to significantly re-
duce the force structure of Army Combat Aviation Brigades, to in-
clude divesting of Air Cavalry Squadrons. While the committee
supports the cost savings of pure fleeting to AH–64E Apache air-
craft, the committee is concerned about the lack of details regard-
ing the proposed realignment, particularly how the Army will
maintain sufficient capability and capacity through its trans-
formation. The committee is interested in Apache Future Develop-
ment funding and its alignment with Army Transformation Initia-
tive goals, including efforts on manned-unmanned teaming,
launched effects, and modular open system approach implementa-
tion.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than February 15, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on the combat aviation transformation efforts that includes:
(1) The rationale supporting the Army aviation force structure deci-
sion; (2) The investment plan to sustain and modernize the endur-
ing AH–64E Apache fleet across the Future Years Defense Program
(FYDP); (3) A detailed description of current technologies capable
of assuming the reconnaissance role of the Air Cavalry Squadrons,
to ensure there are no capability gaps; (4) A detailed plan describ-
ing the quantities of AH–64E required, by component, across the
FYDP; and (5) Any other matters the Secretary determines rel-
evant.
Army command and control systems software
The committee supports the objectives of the Army’s new net-
work modernization strategy, which aims to field simpler, more in-
tuitive, flexible, and lower signature command and control capabili-
ties across its formations. The committee also notes the significant
investments the Army has previously made in developing and field-
ing its Integrated Tactical Network. Given rapid advances in com-
mercial software and overall budgetary challenges, the committee
would like to better understand how the Army is taking advantage
of its prior investment in commercially developed command and
control software as it pivots its Next Generation Command and
Control (NGC2) strategy.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
on command and control software as it relates to the Army’s NGC2
strategy. The report shall include the following: (1) An identifica-
tion of the capabilities and requirements the Army is seeking in a
new suite of command and control software; (2) The schedule, ac-
quisition strategy, costs, and affordability assessment associated
with the development of new command and control software for
theater, corps, division, and below headquarters; (3) An assessment
of the Army’s prior investment in commercial, off-the-shelf software
for its network strategy and its plans to maintain commercially de-
veloped software to meet its future command and control needs; (4)

Secretary considers relevant.
Army Digital Engineering Center of Excellence
The committee remains supportive of previous efforts to establish
a Digital Engineering Center of Excellence led by the Army Ground
Vehicle System Center. This effort will apply the U.S. Army’s dig-
ital transformation effort to all parts of the vehicle lifecycle, includ-
ing development, manufacturing, fleet maintenance (including pro-
ducing an inventory of obsolete parts, which are no longer manu-
factured, for deployed weapon systems), and the ability to virtually
and physically prototype next generation ground systems. The com-
mittee believes that a Digital Engineering Center of Excellence
would provide the government and its academic partners with an
avenue whereby the warfighter can meet the growing threats by
rapidly fielding capabilities that are both current and emerging.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 20, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives detailing the status of the establishment of a Digital
Engineering Center of Excellence. The briefing shall include, at a
minimum, information about the Army’s planning for and imple-
mentation of digital engineering practices across the lifecycle of its
vehicles. It should also include Army efforts to capitalize on the ca-
pabilities of domestic academic partners in this endeavor.
Army Ground Combat Vehicles
The committee supports the Army’s decision to accelerate its
M1E3 tank modernization program and to continue investment in
its next-generation combat vehicle program, XM–30. The committee
is concerned with the shift in the autonomous ground combat vehi-
cle efforts and would like to better understand how the Army in-
tends to incorporate remote ground combat vehicle investments to
date into its future formations. Additionally, with years of lagging
investment in Armored Brigade Combat Team modernization and
near-term focus on Infantry Brigade Combat Team organization
and structure, the committee is concerned about the Army’s plan-
ning and investment strategy for modernizing its heavier forma-
tions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than October 10, 2025, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, on the Army’s concept for delivering modernized ground com-
bat vehicles to its Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Teams.
The briefing shall include: (1) A description of brigade combat team
structure, by vehicle type, as planned; (2) A projected timeline for
modernizing these formations across the active and reserve compo-
nents; (3) Procurement quantities and funding through the future
years defense program; and (4) Any other matters the Secretary be-
lieves relevant.

tive outcomes associated with the Maneuverable Lightweight Elec-
tric Weight Reducer (MLEWR) efforts, including incorporating Si-
lent Tactical Energy Enhanced Dismount and associated Modular
Mission Payloads (MMP) into U.S. Army Transformation-in-Con-
tact events, highlight the potential for significant enhancements in
troop mobility, lethality, and survivability. Further, the committee
understands that the U.S. Army developed an Abbreviated Capa-
bility Development Document for the Dismount Unit Soldier Trans-
port (DUST) based on the MLEWR effort. We applaud U.S. Army
efforts to rapidly experiment, procure, and deploy these capabili-
ties.
The committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a
briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on:
(1) The procurement plan for DUST capabilities; (2) An analysis of
the utility of the MMPs developed at the direct request of units; (3)
How MMPs fit into the procurement plan; and (4) A summary of
current activities on the platforms within the DUST and MLEWR
efforts.
Army Prepositioned Stocks
The committee understands that the Army is developing concepts
to optimize its Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS) program. As stra-
tegically positioned sets of equipment with rolling stock and weap-
on systems, APS are designed to reduce deployment response
times. Recent actions, including Army efforts to move away from
afloat stocks and issuance of stop-work notices for other APS sets
due to lack of funding, raise serious concerns about the Army’s
commitment to this critical capability.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, on Army efforts to optimize its APS programs to en-
sure it has the right equipment in the right location with the right
readiness level. The briefing shall include: (1) Planned posture, lo-
cation, and structure of stocks; (2) Intended readiness model; (3)
Plan to maintain visibility of equipment sets; (4) Future facility re-
quirements, including modernization requirements of current facili-
ties; (5) Planned governance structure that mitigates noted defi-
ciencies in current management model; and (6) Planned funding for
the APS program through the future years defense program.
Assessment of hypersonic materials manufacturing and in-
dustrial base
The committee supports the Department of Defense’s ongoing ef-
forts to expand and strengthen the U.S. hypersonic weapons indus-
trial base, which is critical to the development and fielding of cur-
rent and future hypersonic and reentry systems in alignment with
the National Defense Strategy. To ensure continued progress in
this area and mitigate supply chain risks, the committee empha-
sizes the need for a comprehensive assessment of the resilience and
scalability of the industrial base supporting these technologies.
The committee notes that hypersonic systems and reentry vehi-
cles used in strategic systems operate under extreme thermal and

structural stress, relying on advanced high-temperature materials,
including Thermal Protection System (TPS) components. The com-
mittee understands that one such material, Carbon/Carbon (C/C)
composite, is essential due to its ability to withstand extreme heat.
However, the manufacturing of these materials, especially through
processes such as densification, which makes the material stronger
and more heat-resistant, remains slow and presents a key produc-
tion bottleneck. These constraints, along with limitations in ma-
chining, assembly, and specialized workforce availability, present
challenges to scaling production to meet national security needs.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026,
on the state of the U.S. hypersonic materials manufacturing and
industrial base. The briefing shall include: (1) An evaluation of cur-
rent Carbon/Carbon composite densification capabilities, including
capacity limitations and throughput challenges; (2) An analysis of
emerging or alternative densification processes being developed or
utilized by industry that could significantly accelerate production
and reduce cost; (3) A review of key bottlenecks across the indus-
trial base, including in the areas of materials fabrication, precision
machining, and system assembly, along with recommendations to
address these constraints and improve scalability; (4) An assess-
ment of material performance and durability under extreme ther-
mal and mechanical conditions relevant to hypersonic and reentry
applications; (5) Recommendations for targeted investments in in-
frastructure, workforce development, and manufacturing capabili-
ties needed to strengthen domestic production capacity; and (6) A
strategy to optimize production throughput, control costs, and re-
duce dependency on foreign sources of critical materials or compo-
nents.
The committee expects this briefing to inform future oversight
and investment decisions aimed at ensuring the U.S. hypersonic in-
dustrial base is resilient, responsive, and capable of meeting na-
tional defense requirements.
Briefing on Conventional Prompt Strike advanced capa-
bility development
The committee notes the role that the Navy Conventional Prompt
Strike (CPS) weapon will play in potential Indo-Pacific contin-
gencies. The committee is concerned, however, that adversaries’
abilities to counter various U.S. munitions are improving at a rapid
pace.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of Navy Strategic
Systems Programs, in coordination with the Director of the Army’s
Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, to brief the
congressional defense committees on the CPS program’s Advanced
Capability Program for addressing navigation and interceptor
threats that could reduce the capability of the CPS system. The Di-
rector should provide that briefing not later than October 1, 2025.
The briefing should address: (1) The current threat assessment for
the baseline CPS program and the level of expected capability deg-
radation from those threats that the baseline CPS is expected to
experience; (2) Future technology insertion points to enhance per-

technologies and capabilities being developed with that funding;
and (5) Whether the funding plan is sufficient to adequately ad-
dress wartime survivability and lethality requirements.
C–130 propeller study
The committee supports the Navy and Air Force in their respec-
tive propeller retrofit programs across multiple platforms. Having
the safest, most reliable, and highest-performing propellers across
aircraft enhances operational readiness and contributes to the over-
all airlift mission. The committee understands the Navy and Air
Force will finish retrofitting the entire C–130H fleet this year with
an 8-bladed propeller system, while the C–130J currently operates
with a legacy 6-bladed propeller system.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the Navy and
Air Force to conduct a comparative study, independent of the air
vehicle manufacturer, on the two propeller systems on each plat-
form that would, at a minimum, provide a comparative analysis
that includes the following for the preceding fiscal year: (1) Quan-
tify propeller removals due to propeller-specific issues for both sys-
tems; (2) Identify the mean time between failure and mean time
between removal of each system; (3) Identify maintenance costs,
both dollars and man-hours, to maintain each propeller system; (4)
Quantify mission aborts due to propeller system issues for both
systems; and (5) Include any other relevant data or analysis rel-
evant for comparing the two systems.
The Secretaries should provide this report to the congressional
defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026.
C–130H divestment plan
The committee is aware of the Air Force’s plans to divest por-
tions of the C–130H fleet as part of ongoing modernization and
force structure adjustments. The committee emphasizes the impor-
tance of maintaining mission capability and readiness at installa-
tions affected by such changes, particularly within the Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve.
To ensure transparency and informed oversight, the committee
directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a briefing to the
congressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026.
The briefing should address: (1) Installations impacted by C–130H
divestment; (2) Potential new or replacement flying missions under
consideration for affected bases; (3) Anticipated personnel and in-
frastructure implications; and (4) The status of coordination with
state and local stakeholders.
The committee expects the Air Force to remain engaged with af-
fected communities and to keep the Congress informed throughout
the decision-making process.
CMV–22 enhancement

off and landing capabilities. The program has improved the V–22’s
endurance, but not all V–22s have yet received the improvements.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Secretary of the Navy
to integrate nacelle improvement modifications into the CMV–22B
aircraft fleet to improve readiness and reliability and to help sus-
tain the tiltrotor industrial base.
Collaborative Combat Aircraft program
The committee remains concerned about the rapid military
growth of U.S. adversaries and the speed at which mass-produced,
modern capabilities are proliferating, threatening the air superi-
ority that has underpinned U.S. military dominance for decades. To
counter these threats, the committee encourages the Air Force to
continue pursuing initiatives that enable the affordable and rapid
fielding of capable airpower at scale.
The committee remains strongly supportive of the Collaborative
Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, particularly Increment 1. In just
a few years, the CCA program has progressed from conceptual de-
velopment to the verge of production and fielding of an operation-
ally relevant capability while leveraging technologically advanced
contributions from an expanding industrial base. While CCAs are
envisioned to operate alongside fighter aircraft, the committee is
also supportive of the potential for autonomous aircraft and the ex-
pansion of these capabilities to other missions traditionally con-
ducted by manned platforms. However, the committee is concerned
that the Air Force has not articulated a clear and detailed plan to
integrate the F–35A into the CCA concept of operations, despite
the F–35’s central role in the future fighter force.
The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide
a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than December 15, 2025, on
the service’s plans to transition CCA Increment 1 prototypes to
full-scale production. The Secretary’s briefing should include: (1)
The associated resource requirements; (2) Plans for incorporating
the reserve components into the CCA operational structure; (3) A
detailed description of the Air Force’s approach to integrating
CCAs with fifth-generation platforms, including the F–35A; (4)
Technical integration and mission pairing concepts; (5) Data link
and software interoperability; and (6) Operational test planning.
The committee further requests that the Air Force provide regular
updates on the progress of fielding CCA capability, including the
integration of these systems into operational squadrons.
Comptroller General review of tiltrotor technology
The committee remains concerned about the safety record of the
V–22 program and believes that an independent group should as-
sess the safety, operational viability, and cost-effectiveness of the
V–22 program.
The committee directs the Comptroller General of the United
States to conduct a comprehensive review of the V–22 program.
The Comptroller General should submit a report based on the re-
view, not later than December 31, 2026, and include the following:
(1) An assessment of the safety, cost, reliability, and performance
of the V–22 Osprey aircraft across the Department of Defense

and support costs; and (c) operational readiness rates; and (8) An
assessment of DOD efforts to incorporate lessons learned from the
development and deployment of the V–22 for the FLRAA program.
Concerns about accelerated divestment of A–10 aircraft
The committee is gravely concerned by the Department of the Air
Force’s decision to accelerate full divestment of the A–10 fleet in
fiscal year 2026, 3 years ahead of the previously stated glidepath.
This decision, disclosed only through fiscal year 2026 budget docu-
ments and not through direct communication with Congress, rep-
resents a fundamental breach of transparency and undermines
prior commitments to responsibly manage force structure changes.
The Department’s decision to proceed with full divestment, with-
out providing mission transition plans for affected units or ensur-
ing sufficient combat capacity replacement, raises serious concerns
about readiness, force distribution, and the Department’s commit-
ment to responsible stewardship.
Of particular concern is the lack of communication with or con-
sideration for A–10 units that are currently deployed in support of
combatant commands. These units are actively supporting ongoing
operational requirements, and to propose their divestment imme-
diately upon return from deployment—without replacement mis-
sions or personnel transition plans—damages the credibility of the
Department and risks future recruitment and retention of pilots
and maintainers across the total force.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide, not later than January 15, 2026, a briefing for the con-
gressional defense committees that includes:
(1) A list of all A–10 units scheduled for divestment in fiscal
year 2026, fiscal year 2027, and fiscal year 2028, including lo-
cation, component (Active, Guard, Reserve), number of aircraft,
and whether the unit is currently deployed or scheduled for de-
ployment during that period;

assignments, retention, recruiting shortfalls); and
(3) An assessment of the operational risk incurred by remov-
ing the A–10 fleet from the inventory on an accelerated
timeline.
Consideration of additional F–16 aircraft procurement
The committee recognizes the continued relevance of the F–16
Fighting Falcon in meeting U.S. and allied tactical air require-
ments, particularly in support of homeland defense, partner capac-
ity-building, and theater security cooperation. As the Department
of the Air Force continues to modernize its fighter fleet, the com-
mittee believes that procuring additional new-build F–16 aircraft
could provide a cost-effective means to augment force structure and
mitigate near-term capacity gaps caused by legacy aircraft retire-
ments.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than December
1, 2025, on the feasibility, cost, and strategic benefit of procuring
additional Block 70/72 F–16 aircraft. The briefing should include:
(1) An evaluation of potential roles and missions for additional F–
16 aircraft in the context of Air National Guard and active-duty
force utilization; (2) An analysis of production capacity and
timelines from the F–16 production line, including options to accel-
erate delivery; and (3) An estimate of procurement costs, including
unit cost comparisons with alternative platforms.
The committee encourages the Air Force to seriously consider the
benefits of additional F–16 procurement as part of a balanced and
affordable tactical airpower strategy.
Considerations for Agile Combat Employment
The committee supports the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employ-
ment (ACE) concept and emphasizes the need to rapidly reconsti-
tute airfield operations and defend forward locations in contested
environments. Three critical capability areas require continued de-
velopment: (1) Clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO); (2)
Deployable precision landing surveillance systems in GPS-denied
conditions; and (3) Mobile air base defense systems.
The committee notes the Recovery of Air Bases Denied by Ord-
nance (RADBO) vehicle provides vital UXO clearance capabilities
but relies on the legacy Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle
platform. The committee is encouraged by efforts to transition
RADBO capabilities to the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The com-
mittee is also concerned with the Air Force’s ability to deploy preci-
sion landing systems to austere airfields in GPS-denied environ-
ments and notes the need for lightweight, rapidly deployable solu-
tions. Additionally, the committee notes the potential use of the
Army’s Land-Based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) for contrib-
uting to air base defense but recognizes modifications are required
for C–130 transportability.

Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, on plans to support ACE through: (1)
Transition and future requirements for RADBO, including platform
modernization; (2) Current and planned capabilities for deployable
surveillance and precision landing in GPS-denied environments;
and (3) Assessment of LPWS suitability for air base defense, in-
cluding potential redesign for expeditionary use.
The committee expects this briefing to include cost, schedule,
operational concepts, and requirements to ensure the Air Force can
project and sustain combat power from dispersed, austere locations.
Counter unmanned aerial system policy
The committee notes that the war in Ukraine has led to an ex-
plosion of innovation in technology and tactics when it comes to
technology and tactics for both Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)
and counter-UAS (cUAS). This was most dramatically dem-
onstrated in Ukraine’s early June Operation Spiderweb, in which
Ukraine launched over 100 first person view (FPV) drones from
deep within Russian territory, dealing a significant blow to the
Russian air force.
The committee recognizes that this not only demonstrated the in-
genuity and capability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, it high-
lighted our own vulnerabilities to FPV drones—a dramatic cul-
mination of concerns that have been growing in the committee for
years.
PM 17–00X, Supplemental Guidance for Countering Unmanned
Aircraft, provides critical guidance to the Department of Defense
(DOD) and military services—including the definition of ‘‘threat’’
under section 130i of title 10, United States Code, and delineating
when and how the Department can track and engage UAS threats.
However, this guidance dates back to 2017, long before the war in
Ukraine rapidly accelerated UAS technology and tactics.
Accordingly, the committee recommends that the Secretary of
Defense update PM 17–00X and provide a briefing to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives at a mutually agreed upon time, not later than February 15,
2026, on the following: (1) Plans to update PM 17–00X to account
for changes in technology, tactics, and threats to DOD installations
since 2017; (2) A reassessment of the PM 17–00X definition of
‘‘threat’’ under section 130i of title 10, United States Code, to ac-
count for the ongoing physical and surveillance threat a fast-mov-
ing UAS poses to a covered asset or facility even as it departs a
military installation; (3) An assessment of whether overflight and
surveillance activities should be considered a physical threat to
DOD personnel, systems, and facilities given the ease with which
small FPV drones can be configured with offensive capabilities and
the lack of reaction time their speed affords servicemembers on
base; (4) An assessment of when kinetic cUAS options should be
employed, especially in light of advances in artificial intelligence
and non-radio frequency means of UAS guidance; (5) An assess-
ment of any legislative changes required to provide cUAS protec-
tion to private shipyards actively building U.S. Navy vessels and
whether that varies depending on the type of ship under construc-

tion; (6) Any barriers in statute that prevent a comprehensive pol-
icy update by the Department.
Counter unmanned aerial systems delegation of authority
The committee is concerned that current Department of Defense
policy may not adequately support the timely use of force against
unmanned aerial systems (UAS) that pose a threat to U.S. military
installations. In particular, the committee notes that delegation of
use-of-force authority from the Secretary of Defense to service-re-
tained units is operationally challenging in the absence of standing
identification procedures and clearly defined rules of engagement
tailored to UAS threats. Without such frameworks, installation
commanders and their subordinates may be constrained in their
ability to respond immediately and effectively to hostile or sus-
picious UAS activity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026.
The report shall outline a plan for ensuring installation com-
manders have delegated authority to immediately use force—ki-
netic or non-kinetic—against UAS posing a threat to personnel, in-
frastructure, or operations.
The plan shall include: (1) A framework for delegation of use-of-
force authority below the Secretary of Defense level; (2) Criteria
and procedures for immediate engagement of UAS under various
threat conditions; (3) An assessment of the required coordination
with civil authorities, including the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion and the Department of Homeland Security; (4) Requirements
for installation-level response plans, training, and reporting; and
(5) An assessment of legal compliance with title 10 and title 18,
United States Code. The committee expects the Department to en-
sure that commanders are fully empowered through appropriate
delegation, standing rules, and coordination procedures to defend
installations promptly and lawfully against emerging UAS threats.
Counter unmanned aircraft system pilot program
The committee is aware that incidents of unmanned aerial sys-
tems (UAS) intruding in Department of Defense (DOD)-managed
airspace have been growing at an alarming rate. UAS events
around Hampton, Virginia, and in the New Jersey and New York
areas point out the urgent need for rapid responses and innovation
in counter-UAS (cUAS) systems and processes.
To ensure rapid responses and smooth operations in a crisis,
DOD facilities must have the equipment before anything happens
and must have worked out and exercised agreements with other
Federal, state, and local organizations beforehand.
The committee believes that it would behoove the DOD to estab-
lish one or more pilot programs that would demonstrate and exer-
cise the processes for responding to incursions. Such a demonstra-
tion should address: (1) Sharing situational awareness data from
civilian sensor networks to military installation defense systems;
(2) Sharing DOD situational awareness data with appropriate state
and local officials; (3) Ensuring that other Federal agencies have
the same merged operation picture; (4) Developing capabilities for

cUAS systems; and (5) Assessing what authorities and capability
shortfalls should be further addressed to enhance cooperation be-
tween the DOD, civilian partners, and other U.S. Government enti-
ties.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a re-
port to the congressional defense committees, not later than March
1, 2026, on the recommendations for establishing one or more pilot
programs for implementing and testing standard operating proce-
dures among the interested parties and assessing capability short-
falls.
Deployable expandable shelters
The committee recognizes that the Army’s Standard Family of
Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF RWS) program standardizes shelter sys-
tems to deliver mature, cost-effective technologies to soldiers. This
standardization reduces expenses, simplifies logistics, and en-
hances field support. The committee believes the program provides
critical capabilities that align with key strategic priorities, includ-
ing the Army Campaign Plan, the Army Modernization Strategy,
and the Army Arctic Strategy.
The committee supports prioritizing investment in medical and
Temporary Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (TSCIF)
variants of the Expandable, Panelized, and Collapsible Shelters
(EPACS) within the ASF RWS program. These variants are essen-
tial for maintaining strategic advantage and ensuring operational
readiness across military units.
In addition, the committee recognizes the growing importance of
Expeditionary Shelter Protection Systems (ESPS) in enhancing
contested logistics operations, such as fuel distribution and food
provision. ESPS systems have been deployed at the Army’s Combat
Training Centers (CTCs) to simulate battlefield effects and provide
direct exposure to end-users.
The committee encourages the Army to expand procurement and
fielding of ESPS across CTCs and other operational environments
to further demonstrate their utility and transition the program into
the base budget.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives that addresses the ASF RWS program’s current status
and future requirements, including the following elements: (1) An
assessment of the existing Army shelter program, including EPACS
and ESPS variants; (2) Any challenges identified in developing
EPACS TSCIF, medical, and infrastructure protection variants; (3)
The operational advantages of deploying EPACS TSCIF, ESPS, and
alternative shelter configurations to Army units; (4) The funding
levels and legal authorities required to fully resource all shelter
programs, including recommendations for integrating ESPS into
annual budget submissions; and (5) A recommended approach for
rapidly fielding these capabilities at the lowest cost to the Govern-
ment.

Diversification of Army counter unmanned aerial systems
The committee recognizes the complex threat environment the
Joint Force faces from advanced adversarial Unmanned Aerial Sys-
tems (UAS) capabilities and supports the military services’ recent
efforts to utilize the Unfunded Priority List process, supplemental
funding, and novel contracting approaches, such as U.S. Special
Operations Command’s System Integrations Partnership (SIP), to
procure Group 3 defeat interceptors and integrate innovative sys-
tems into existing Army programs.
The committee notes that production and use of advanced Group
3 systems by our adversaries has begun to outpace the acquisition
of counter-UAS effectors in Army Programs of Record. The com-
mittee remains concerned that the Army does not have a long-term
acquisition plan, nor accompanying budget resources across the Fu-
ture Years Defense Plan, to procure these capabilities at scale or
sustain them across the Army. This situation risks increasing
weapons inventory shortages and sustainment budget shortfalls for
existing systems and fails to address the growing threat in priority
theaters including U.S. Central Command.
The committee encourages the Army to leverage funding avail-
able and utilize the budget process to diversify and expand avail-
able counter-UAS systems. Therefore, the committee directs the
Secretary of the Army to submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the service’s plan to utilize exist-
ing authorities to procure combat-validated counter-UAS intercep-
tors from additional vendors over the next 5 years.
Expeditionary air base defense in support of Agile Combat
Employment
The committee recognizes the centrality of Agile Combat Employ-
ment (ACE) to the Air Force’s future operating concepts, particu-
larly in the Indo-Pacific and other contested theaters. The success
of ACE depends not only on the ability to disperse and maneuver
air assets but also on the survivability and security of expedi-
tionary air bases under persistent threat from unmanned aerial
systems (UAS), cruise missiles, and other precision strike capabili-
ties.
The committee is concerned that the Air Force currently lacks
dedicated, organic capabilities to defend forward-deployed air bases
and that expeditionary base defense remains underdeveloped as a
core service competency. While the Army is expected to provide
ground-based air defense in joint operations, the evolving character
of the threat and the operational demands of ACE require that the
Air Force assume greater responsibility for the defense of its own
forward installations.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 31, 2026, on the Department of the Air Force’s
plan to develop and institutionalize organic air base defense capa-
bilities for expeditionary operations. The briefing should include:
(1) A description of the Air Force’s efforts to establish formal re-
sponsibility for expeditionary air base defense within its organiza-
tional structure, including consideration of a dedicated office, pro-

gram executive group, or cross-functional team charged with devel-
oping and integrating relevant capabilities; (2) An overview of ef-
forts to field layered air base defense solutions such as point-de-
fense missile systems, counter-UAS platforms, electronic warfare
tools, directed energy weapons, sensors, and command and control
architectures tailored to the ACE mission set; (3) A summary of
current or planned pilot units tasked with air base defense at ACE
hubs in forward theaters, including the Indo-Pacific; (4) An over-
view of system prototypes in use, initial operational concepts, and
how these initiatives are informing future doctrine, training, and
force structure decisions; (5) An explanation of how expeditionary
air base defense is being incorporated into Air Force wargames,
campaign modeling, and force design exercises, with attention to
contested logistics, defensive mobility, and ACE-specific operational
constraints; and (6) A review of current and planned budget lines
supporting expeditionary base defense capabilities and how the Air
Force intends to prioritize and sustain these efforts across the fu-
ture years defense program.
The committee encourages the Air Force to treat expeditionary
base defense as a core enabler of ACE and to pursue innovative,
scalable, and threat-adaptive solutions. The committee expects the
Air Force to institutionalize this mission area and provide sus-
tained leadership, oversight, and resourcing to ensure the protec-
tion of forward airpower projection capabilities in contested envi-
ronments.
Experimental Operations Unit
The committee applauds the Department of the Air Force’s ef-
forts to develop doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leader-
ship, personnel, facilities, and policy concepts related to the Col-
laborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). While these efforts are crucial to
delivering the next generation of air superiority, the committee is
concerned that the Experimental Operations Unit (EOU) is dupli-
cative to work already conducted by other test organizations and
diverts critical funding, personnel, and aircraft from focused, delib-
erative, and expeditious test, evaluation, and fielding of CCA.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a report to the congressional defense committees, by not
later than February 15, 2026, on the EOU. The report should in-
clude: (1) The complete funding profile for the EOU, including the
current fiscal year and across the future years defense program, as
well as requirements for military personnel and military construc-
tion for the organization; (2) The current and projected require-
ments for manning the organization over the next 5 years, includ-
ing a breakdown of job classifications; (3) The specific aspects of
CCA operations the Air Force intends to evaluate in the EOU, in-
cluding the specific data that will be collected, how the data will
be collected, who will process the data, and when such evaluations
shall begin and conclude; (4) An explanation as to why the duties
of EOU-assigned personnel could not be performed in the course of
developmental or operational test by pre-existing developmental or
operational test organizations; (5) An explanation of how the tasks
performed by the EOU are different from testing for remotely pi-
loted aircraft and how such evaluations were accomplished for re-

long the Air Force expects to operate the EOU; (8) A description
of the difference between experimentation versus traditional devel-
opmental and operational test as well as any difference in risk ac-
ceptance between the two processes; and (9) A recommendation as
to whether the Air Force should use the EOU for the CCA program
and, if so, an assessment of whether the Air Force should use the
EOU for other acquisitions programs.
F–15E propulsion modernization assessment
The committee remains concerned about fighter capacity and has
consistently raised issues regarding the future of U.S. air superi-
ority and the sustainability of the fighter aircraft industrial base.
While the committee continues to support procurement of addi-
tional F–15EX aircraft, it remains uncertain whether the tactical
fighter force will meet future operational needs even with pur-
chases of F–15EX and other fighter aircraft in the plan. The com-
mittee also notes that the Air Force has not yet submitted the F–
15E retirement report required by the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) and recognizes
there may be viable options to extend the F–15E’s service life.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide, by December 31, 2025, a briefing to the congressional
defense committees on the financial and operational costs and ben-
efits of modernizing the F–15E fleet, specifically the subset of the
fleet with older engines. The assessment should address the poten-
tial impact on mission capability, including propulsion system up-
grades.
F–16 electronic warfare modernization
The committee recognizes the continued importance of the F–16
to the Air Force’s tactical aviation portfolio. As adversary electronic
warfare (EW) and air defense capabilities grow more sophisticated,
legacy platforms like the F–16 must be equipped with modern sur-
vivability enhancements to remain operationally relevant in con-
tested environments.
The Air Force has been developing the Integrated Viper Elec-
tronic Warfare Suite (IVEWS), a digital, open-architecture system
intended to significantly improve the F–16’s survivability against
advanced threats. The committee supports the continued advance-
ment of IVEWS and encourages the Air Force to evaluate addi-
tional EW upgrade options to ensure the most cost-effective, capa-
ble, and sustainable solution is available to the total force.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, on the Air Force’s plan to field these
F–16 EW capabilities. The briefing should include: (1) The current
status, schedule, and performance of IVEWS development and inte-
gration; (2) A description of any other potential F–16 EW mod-
ernization efforts under consideration or in development; (3) The
strategy and criteria for fielding EW upgrades across the active
duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve F–16 fleets; (4)

Funding profiles and procurement plans across the Future Years
Defense Program; and (5) Any assessments of operational effective-
ness, cost, and risk associated with competing or complementary
EW solutions.
The committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring parity in
survivability and mission capability across the total force F–16
fleet and encourages the Department of Defense to pursue a com-
mon, interoperable solution set where feasible.
Flightline Equipment Connectivity
The committee recognizes the critical need to enhance
connectivity for flightline support equipment to enable the Air
Force’s Agile Combat Employment (ACE) strategy. The committee
is concerned that most flightline support equipment, such as gen-
erators, light carts, and support vehicles, remains unconnected,
limiting the Air Force’s ability to optimize asset tracking, health
monitoring, and power management in contested or austere envi-
ronments. This creates gaps, particularly in pre-deployed locations,
where unmonitored equipment often becomes nonmission-capable,
requiring repair or replacement, degrading readiness and under-
mining forward-operating capabilities.
While the committee supports continued investment in 5G tech-
nologies, the committee encourages the Air Force to pursue com-
plementary connectivity solutions tailored to the specific needs of
flightline support equipment—particularly for assets in austere en-
vironments, contested environments, and in long-term storage.
These solutions may include military-grade long-range communica-
tions systems, which offer key advantages, including extended
range and portability; security and independence; low power con-
sumption; and cost and deployment efficiency due to minimal infra-
structure requirements.
The committee encourages the Secretary of the Air Force to
prioritize the evaluation and integration of connectivity solutions
specifically designed for flightline support equipment and directs
the Secretary to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 31, 2026. At a minimum, this briefing shall include: (1)
A detailed assessment of current and planned initiatives to im-
prove connectivity for flightline support equipment; (2) The chal-
lenges and limitations of using existing and future support systems
in ACE scenarios, including impacts on operational security, spec-
trum management, and deployability; (3) An analysis of the feasi-
bility, scalability, and benefits of incorporating military-grade radio
systems into flightline support systems, and how these technologies
complement existing connectivity efforts; and (4) Recommendations
for integrating diverse connectivity solutions to enhance the oper-
ational readiness and resilience of flightline support equipment in
austere environments.
Future X-band radar
The committee notes that the future X-band radar (FXR) is a
planned Navy development program that is designed to replace leg-
acy mast-mounted radars on surface combatants for horizon and
surface search and track. These radars stare out to the horizon to

identify threats. The committee notes that this program is uniquely
funded through Spectrum Relocation Fund dollars, associated with
deconflicting the 3.45–3.55 Mhz S-band spectrum. With this fund-
ing available, the committee believes the Navy should move expedi-
tiously to begin fielding FXR to the fleet to counter advanced
threats. Navy inaction puts more than $11.0 billion in available
funding at risk. With a planned initial operating capability in 2035,
the Navy acquisition plan risks failing to complete procurement of
130 planned ship-sets before the Spectrum Relocation Fund expires
in 2041.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
develop a plan to accelerate the acquisition of FXR. That plan
should achieve low-rate initial production not later than January
1, 2030, and the delivery of at least 5 percent of total planned pro-
duction quantities not later than December 31, 2035. The Secretary
of the Navy is directed to report on the contents of that plan to the
congressional defense committees, not later than March 1, 2026.
Heavy Vehicle Simulator
The committee recognizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ in-
volvement in performing critical infrastructure research on roads,
bridges, airfields, and railroads. The committee notes that a critical
enabler of this mission is the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS),
which is designed to simulate a large number of vehicle passes, at
full scale, on asphalt or concrete pavement in order to safely and
quickly evaluate the effects of highway traffic on a particular pave-
ment being tested.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the U.S. Army and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue its efforts to upgrade,
test, and qualify the HVS Mark IV Program.
Industrial base capacity to support dual sixth-generation
fighter programs
The committee recognizes that both the Air Force and the Navy
are pursuing sixth-generation tactical aircraft platforms—the Air
Force through the F–47 program and the Navy through the F/A–
XX effort. While some have questioned whether the defense indus-
trial base can sustain two sixth-generation fighter programs simul-
taneously, the committee believes that recent reforms to the acqui-
sition system and targeted investments in the defense aerospace
sector have materially strengthened domestic capacity to meet this
challenge, if properly managed.
The committee urges the Department of the Navy to continue its
pursuit of the F/A–XX program as a core component of its future
carrier air wing. In doing so, the Navy should coordinate with the
Department of the Air Force while responding to the unique oper-
ational requirements of the maritime domain. The committee fur-
ther encourages the Department of Defense to ensure that acquisi-
tion strategies for both platforms prioritize programmatic stability,
realistic production planning, and retention of a robust supply
chain.

Litter basket stabilization
The committee understands that the Army is beginning to adopt
autonomous litter stabilization technology that provides precision,
reliability, and predictability for medical evacuation crews oper-
ating in complex environments. The committee believes efforts to
eliminate the need for a tagline in lift operations, and especially
medical evacuation operations, are worth the investment as oper-
ations are improved and risk is reduced to personnel and aircraft.
The committee notes the interest from the Army National Guard
for these capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on Army efforts to procure and employ this capability that en-
ables hoist operations without the need of a tagline.
Marine Corps Arctic capabilities
The committee recognizes the growing importance of Arctic capa-
bilities for our military, especially as commerce and competition in-
crease in the region. This is underscored by China’s ambitions to
be a ‘‘near-Arctic nation’’ and Russia’s continued attempts to ex-
ploit the region for its own strategic gain. The committee further
believes that the U.S. military is currently ill-equipped and under-
trained for Arctic conditions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy, in
consultation with the Commandant of the Marine Corps, to provide
a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than February 26, 2026, de-
tailing a proposed glidepath to train and fully equip a regimental-
sized element within 3 years of the report’s submission. The glide-
path shall include at a minimum: (1) Resourcing requirements to
provide the unit with military equipment and clothing that enables
fighting in Arctic environments as part of the unit’s permanently
assigned equipment set; (2) Resourcing requirements to support an-
nual training in seasonal cold weather environments for all or part
of the unit that prioritizes training opportunities in support of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command.
MH–139 Grey Wolf procurement
The committee recognizes that the Air Force has been procuring
the MH–139 Grey Wolf helicopter to modernize its aging fleet of
UH–1 helicopters. However, the committee believes that the deci-
sion to truncate the MH–139 program before acquiring enough air-
craft to fully replace the UH–1 fleet raises significant concerns.
The committee believes that restoring procurement to the origi-
nal plan of 84 aircraft is necessary to meet mission requirements
for security, missile field transport, and very important person op-
erations. The committee does not believe that continuing to operate
some portion of the UH–1 fleet makes economic sense or is advis-
able from the standpoint of safety.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Air Force to notify the
congressional defense committees within 30 days of identifying any
anticipated delays in the delivery of MH–139 aircraft. This notifica-

tion should include a written explanation detailing the reasons for
the delay.
Military aircraft engine industrial base
The committee recognizes that maintaining a skilled engineering
and design workforce within the military aircraft engine industrial
base is essential to national security. To that end, the U.S. Govern-
ment has made significant investments in next-generation military
engine technologies over the past decade. However, the absence of
a comprehensive strategy for transitioning these innovations into
developmental and in-production aircraft platforms remains a crit-
ical gap. These advancements, while promising, are not being field-
ed at the pace necessary to maintain U.S. superiority, particularly
as foreign adversaries continue to make measurable gains in en-
gine performance and reliability.
Additionally, the committee notes that ongoing aircraft develop-
ment programs across military departments are progressing largely
in isolation, without unified guidance or coordination. This frag-
mented approach undermines efforts to build a resilient, competi-
tive, and effective engine industrial base that supports both current
and future manned and unmanned aircraft programs. As the De-
partment of Defense increases its focus on strengthening the U.S.
industrial and manufacturing base, it is imperative to provide the
domestic military aircraft engine sector with a clearer, more coher-
ent path from innovation to integration. This includes aligning
technology maturation, production readiness, and platform adop-
tion timelines.
The committee believes that the Air Force’s Next Generation
Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program represents a notable effort to
develop and reduce risk for adaptive engine prototypes to support
the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) family of systems, in-
cluding F–47 and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), as well as
joint requirements like F/A–XX. While NGAP is designed to oper-
ate independently of NGAD’s broader development timeline, it re-
mains critical that this initiative be viewed within the larger con-
text of a strategic engine industrial base framework.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, that would outline the current state
and future trajectory of the U.S. military aircraft engine industrial
base, with a particular focus on: (1) Workforce sustainability and
advanced manufacturing readiness; (2) Integration of next-genera-
tion engine technologies into current and future platforms; (3)
Inter-service coordination and strategic guidance for engine devel-
opment; (4) Industrial base capacity and competitiveness; (5) Align-
ment of the NGAP program within broader Department objectives;
and (6) A roadmap for fielding sixth-generation propulsion tech-
nologies.
This briefing will inform congressional oversight and support the
continued technological superiority and industrial resilience of the
U.S. military aircraft engine sector.

Modular munitions for small unmanned aerial systems
The Secretary of Defense has stated that the Department of De-
fense will prioritize the adoption and integration of drone tech-
nology in the military. The role that drones and small, unmanned
aerial systems (sUAS) will play in future warfare is evident in
these systems’ use in Ukraine. As part of the broader adoption of
drones, the committee believes it is important that payloads on
these sUAS vehicles be able to integrate with various types of
sUAS for a variety of missions, from clearing minefields to strategic
target prosecution.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, on any plans to pro-
cure modular munitions that can be adopted for the different types
of autonomous systems that the Department plans to widely field
in the coming years. The briefing shall include: (1) Potential cost
savings for the Department that modular munitions can provide;
(2) The Department’s plan for payloads on autonomous systems; (3)
How such procurement relates to the Department’s strategies for
distributed operations; and (4) The contribution that the Depart-
ment expects of autonomous systems in carrying out distributed op-
erations.
MQ–9 Replacement
The committee is concerned that current attrition rates for the
MQ–9 platform will leave the Air Force unable to meet warfighter
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) requirements
that cannot be fulfilled by space-based capabilities. The committee
believes that planning for a capable airborne successor to the MQ–
9 must be a key element of the Air Force’s broader ISR strategy,
required elsewhere in this Act.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to prepare an analysis of the feasibility of developing and deploying
an airborne alternative to the MQ–9 and provide a briefing on this
analysis to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than December 31, 2025.
This analysis should consider options for a dedicated MQ–9 re-
placement or a next-generation medium-altitude unmanned aerial
system capable of performing, at a minimum, the missions cur-
rently conducted by the MQ–9 and deployable at a comparable
scale.
Munitions Handling Unit lift modernization
The committee is aware that capital investment in new pieces of
ground support equipment (GSE) has been limited, leading to a sit-
uation where, after over 50 years of operation, sustainment and
readiness are now critical capability shortfall risks across the GSE
fleet. The committee notes that the Munitions Handling Unit–83
(MHU–83) is an essential munitions trailer, used primarily for
loading ordnance in the 3000–7000lb range. The MHU–83 is used
for loading both nuclear and conventional weapons on U.S. Air
Force Strategic Bombers and heavy ordnance for strike aircraft and
U.S. Navy P–8s. The committee understands that modernization ef-
forts to the MHU–83 have been requested by operators for years,
as the legacy MHU–83 has faced readiness and operational issues

and has caused airmen to be hospitalized due to exhaust inhalation
during extended loading operations.
Therefore, given the importance of the MHU–83, the committee
directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a one-time briefing
to the congressional defense committees, not later than March 31,
2026, on efforts to modernize the MHU–83 for conventional and
strategic munitions.
Navy actions on Government Accountability Office rec-
ommendations
The committee notes that the Comptroller General of the United
States has produced several reports over the last 10 years that
have included 90 specific recommendations to help the Navy im-
prove its management of the shipbuilding portfolio. The committee
understands that the Navy has only implemented, to a greater or
lesser extent, some 30 of these recommendations. As part of a larg-
er effort to improve the quality and timeliness of the Navy’s ship-
building enterprise, the committee needs to understand why the
Navy has chosen not to implement the other Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) recommendations.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than May 1, 2026, on the 90 recommendations the GAO has made
since 2015 to improve Navy shipbuilding. The report should: (1)
Identify actions the Navy has taken in response to recommenda-
tions that have been implemented, including an assessment of
whether the recommendations had a positive impact on Navy ship-
building; (2) Identify actions the Navy has taken in response to rec-
ommendations that have been partially implemented, explain why
those recommendations were only partially implemented, and iden-
tify what gaps in authorities or resources have prevented full im-
plementation; and (3) Identify GAO recommendations on which the
Navy has taken no action, including an explanation for why given
recommendations have not been followed and whether gaps in au-
thorities or resources have prevented adoption of the GAO rec-
ommendation.
Next generation mobility requirements
The committee recognizes the critical importance of modernizing
the Air Force’s mobility enterprise to ensure the Joint Force retains
the ability to project and sustain combat power in contested and
degraded operational environments. In particular, the committee
supports ongoing efforts to develop next-generation strategic and
intra-theater airlift, aerial refueling, and distinguished visitor air-
lift capabilities that are survivable, agile, and aligned with future
operational concepts such as Agile Combat Employment and inte-
grated with the Air Force’s force design.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31,
2026, on the status of: (1) A next-generation strategic airlift pro-
gram, including efforts to define requirements, operational con-
cepts, and acquisition strategies to replace or augment existing
strategic airlift aircraft; (2) A next-generation tactical airlift pro-

gram, including defining platform characteristics, projected mission
sets, and describing how the capability will support distributed op-
erations in contested environments; (3) The Next Generation Aerial
Support System program for satisfying aerial refueling require-
ments, including survivability requirements, integration with fu-
ture airframes, and concepts for operations in denied or degraded
threat environments; (4) A program for distinguished visitor airlift
recapitalization, including modernization needs, mission require-
ments, and alignment with broader mobility force structure plan-
ning; (5) Cross-service coordination and integration with allied and
partner capabilities; (6) Alignment with the Department of De-
fense’s force design and posture planning; and (7) Any anticipated
challenges or decision points in the coming fiscal years.
The committee also encourages the Air Force to explore the po-
tential applicability of emerging commercial technologies, including
supersonic platforms, alternative propulsion systems, and innova-
tive airframe designs, that may offer improvements in speed, effi-
ciency, and survivability for future mobility missions.
Next generation night vision devices
The committee recognizes the importance of the goal of the Inte-
grated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) program to enhance
warfighter situational awareness, lethality, and operational effec-
tiveness. However, the committee is concerned about the delays in
the Army’s ability to acquire an optimized system that meets sol-
dier requirements. With the increased competitiveness in the ad-
vanced night vision capabilities environment, the committee en-
courages the U.S. Army to expeditiously pursue its next generation
night vision devices. Further, the committee encourages the Army
to prioritize the selection of a night vision solution that is cost-effi-
cient; that is designed with durability, modularity, and lightweight
construction; and that has the ability to rapidly iterate to address
soldier-identified improvements or expansions of capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on its ‘‘Own the Night Strategy’’ and its efforts to opti-
mize investment in advanced night vision capabilities.
Next Generation Squad Weapon magazine development test-
ing
The committee recognizes the importance of rapidly developing
and acquiring commercial components that reduce soldier load and
improve reliability. Magazine selection is critical as it directly im-
pacts weapon performance and soldier safety, with historical test-
ing showing significant performance variations between designs.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
review the Next Generation Squad Weapon magazine qualification
testing and reliability process to ensure that there were trans-
parent and timely opportunities for commercial, off-the-shelf sup-
plied components, specifically magazines, to compete fairly. Addi-
tionally, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to review
whether proper contracting practices were instituted. Finally, the
committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a briefing,

not later than February 20, 2026, to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, detailing
the findings from these reviews.
Organic Industrial Base artillery ammunition moderniza-
tion
The committee is concerned that the Army needs to increase its
investment in organic ammunition plant manufacturing safety and
readiness projects to meet current and future requirements. The
committee understands that adding a new production line, based
upon designs for the Universal Artillery Production Line, to the or-
ganic industrial base would provide the Army additional resilience
and surge capacity to meet demand across a range of artillery pro-
duction, particularly for metal components.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 26, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on the progress of modernization funding across am-
munition plants.
Precision artillery munition modernization
The committee understands that capabilities currently exist that
would enable the Army to integrate Global Positioning System
(GPS)-resilient hardware and software into the Excalibur incre-
ment 1b and other precision artillery munitions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on the Army’s assessment of technical options available to en-
hance the performance of the munition in a GPS-denied environ-
ment, including the technical feasibility and operational utility of
incorporating Global Positioning System (GPS)-resilient hardware
and software into current munitions to improve and expand capa-
bility.
Preservation of World War II-era Aircraft in Air Force His-
toric Collection
The committee recognizes the profound contributions of Amer-
ican airmen during World War II and the lasting importance of
preserving the aircraft they flew. As the number of surviving vet-
erans of that conflict continues to decline, the aircraft that remain
in the Department of the Air Force’s historic collection serve as
tangible, irreplaceable links to a defining era in American and
world history.
The committee emphasizes that these aircraft are national assets
and must be treated with the respect appropriate to their historical
value. These aircraft are not only critical to honoring those who
served but also to inspiring future generations with the legacy of
service and sacrifice.
The committee is concerned that many of these historically sig-
nificant aircraft, particularly those produced prior to December 31,
1945, are currently housed on external display and are at increas-
ing risk of irreversible degradation due to environmental exposure.
Without urgent action to relocate these aircraft into indoor, cli-

mate-controlled environments, their long-term preservation may no
longer be viable.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing, not later than December 31, 2025, to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on the Department of the Air Force’s plan to relo-
cate, preserve, and sustain its World War II-era aircraft currently
on external display. The briefing should address the following: (1)
A plan to initiate the phased relocation of historic aircraft produced
prior to December 31, 1945, from external to indoor display facili-
ties, with prioritization given to B–17s, B–18s, B–24s, B–25s, B–
29s, A–26s, P–38s, P–47s, P–51s, C–46s, and C–47s; (2) A proposed
prioritization framework for relocation, favoring institutions such
as the National Museum of the United States Air Force
(NMUSAF), the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum,
NMUSAF-affiliated partner museums, other Department of De-
fense service museums, and national air museums of allied and
partner nations; (3) A plan for modifying or superseding existing
loan agreements that only permit external display, in order to favor
applicants with: (a) indoor, climate-controlled display capabilities;
(b) demonstrated ability to conduct historical restoration and pres-
ervation; and (c) public access commitments; (4) An assessment of
opportunities for artifact trades to enhance the NMUSAF collection
or broader Department of the Air Force heritage efforts; (5) A long-
term framework for the de-accessioning of at-risk aircraft that can-
not be preserved under these conditions within 5 years, including
authority to: (a) offer such aircraft for sale with proceeds directed
to NMUSAF activities; (b) transfer aircraft on an as-is, where-is
basis, with no cost or guarantee of condition to the Department of
the Air Force; and (c) remove end-use restrictions from de-
accessioned assets; (6) A reaffirmation that no aircraft produced
prior to December 31, 1945, may be destroyed, scrapped, or other-
wise damaged by the Department of the Air Force; and (7) A proc-
ess for granting waivers for continued external display where envi-
ronmental conditions, such as those in arid regions, significantly
reduce the risk of corrosion and physical decay.
The committee intends to closely monitor the Department of the
Air Force’s stewardship of these artifacts to ensure their preserva-
tion for future generations.
Propellant industrial base expansion
The committee understands the defense industrial base currently
lacks sufficient surge capacity for energetic material production, in-
cluding propellants that are required across a broad spectrum of
critical munitions programs. The committee is aware that the cur-
rent energetic industrial base consists of multiple single points of
failure that would limit the Department of Defense’s ability to
surge propellant production in moments of crisis, specifically dur-
ing large-scale combat operations against a peer competitor. Fur-
ther, the committee notes that section 114 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) required a report on
the procurement of energetic materials from sources outside the
United States and expressed the need to strengthen and expand

domestic production capacity of energetic materials, including pro-
pellants.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a one-time report to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 1, 2026, on the advisability and feasibility of
expanding domestic propellant production capacity to increase re-
siliency within the defense industrial base. The report should be
unclassified and may include a classified annex if necessary. At a
minimum, the report should include: (1) An analysis of current de-
fense organic industrial base (OIB) propellant production capacity,
including the capability to surge production; (2) A review of current
and expected propellant requirements across the military services;
(3) An analysis of the Department’s OIB, specifically the U.S.
Army’s OIB, which identifies installations that could support addi-
tional propellant manufacturing activities; and (4) An assessment
of estimated financial costs associated with expanding propellant
production at the aforementioned U.S. Army OIB installations, in-
cluding the potential of public-private partnerships.
Rapid fielding of commercial command and control oper-
ating systems
The committee recognizes that the deployment of integrated com-
mand and control operating systems that leverage proven commer-
cial technologies has demonstrated significant operational success
in enhancing command and control capabilities, situational aware-
ness, targeting, and decision-making effectiveness for the
warfighter.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than February 16,
2026, on: (1) Efforts to field commercial command and control oper-
ating systems to the military departments, the Office of the Sec-
retary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the Missile Defense Agency;
(2) Plans for the integration or retirement of existing data plat-
forms and command and control systems; (3) Metrics for evaluating
mission impact, data interoperability, and operational readiness;
and (4) Any other matters the Secretary considers appropriate.
Report on critical suppliers registry
The committee notes that section 844 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law
115–232) requires the Secretary of Defense to administer a process
to analyze and assess potential items for consideration to be re-
quired to be procured from a manufacturer that is part of the na-
tional technology and industrial base (NTIB). Despite multiple re-
quests, the committee has not received information regarding
progress toward the establishment of the required process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than December 1, 2025, providing an update on the implementa-
tion of this requirement. The report shall include, at a minimum,
a description of: (1) How the Department of Defense has imple-
mented the program; (2) The Department’s designated official re-
sponsible for administration; (3) The process for an organization to

The number of components or organizations that have applied; (5)
The number and list of components that have been approved; and
(6) Recommendations for facilitating accessibility for applications
from suppliers.
Requirements related to Navy amphibious warfare ships
The committee notes that in the last several years, the Marine
Corps has not been able to sustain the 3.0 Marine Expeditionary
Unit (MEU) presence because only 13 or 14 of the Navy’s fleet of
31 amphibious ships are available at any one time due to mainte-
nance challenges. The committee believes the Department of De-
fense should define the requirement for MEU presence and pro-
gram the resources to achieve that requirement by providing suffi-
cient ships, repair and maintenance of those ships, and manning
of those ships.
Therefore, the committee directs the Vice Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to conduct an analysis to determine the requirement
for MEU presence and to report the results of that analysis to the
congressional defense committees, not later than May 1, 2026.
The committee believes that the Navy, as it executes the ship-
building program to achieve those requirements, should purchase
amphibious ships using multi-ship procurement authorities.
The committee also directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide
a report, not later than May 1, 2026, that formally responds to the
recommendations in the Government Accountability Office report
published on December 4, 2024, titled ‘‘Amphibious Warfare Fleet:
Navy Needs to Complete Key Efforts to Better Ensure Ships Are
Available for Marines’’’ (GAO–25–106728), which concluded that
the Navy needs to complete key efforts to better ensure ships are
available for marines to conduct Marine Corps missions, such as
amphibious assault and humanitarian response.
Secondary sources in the munitions supply chain
The committee recognizes the critical importance of our arsenals,
depots, and ammunition plants for our national defense. The provi-
sion included in section 334 of the Servicemember Quality of Life
Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) required a plan for secondary
sources in the munitions supply chain.
The committee remains focused on this issue and urges the De-
partment of Defense to expedite the briefing and subsequent plan,
which is already past its original due date of June 23, 2025, as it
will help inform the committee on potential future legislative ac-
tions.
Squad Designated Marksman Rifle
The committee is aware that U.S. Special Operations Command
(SOCOM) has procured and fielded the Mid-Range Gas Gun Sniper
(MRGG–S) platform that has proven to be highly accurate and reli-
able. The committee is also aware that the M110 Squad Designated
Marksman Rifle (SDMR) that is used extensively throughout the
Army is coming to the end of its service life. The M110 SDMR is

chambered in the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge, and the Army is in
the process of transitioning to a new 6.8x51mm cartridge. The com-
mittee is aware that MRGG–S upper receivers have been developed
and chambered in 6.8x51mm and that those upper receiver groups
are compatible with the lower receiver of the M110 SDMR.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 20, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on the advisability and feasibility of a service life ex-
tension program for the M110 SDMR that incorporates the
6.8x51mm upper receiver group.
Status of B–52 TF33 engine generators
The committee notes that the B–52H Stratofortress is under-
going a program to replace its original TF33 engines, which are
now in diminishing supply and are a critical asset to airplane
availability. The committee further notes that the TF33 engines
are paired with one generator for every two engines to provide 125
kilovolt-amperes (kVA) each. Until such time as the replacement
engine and generator set under the Commercial Engine Replace-
ment Program become available, the B52–H will rely on the exist-
ing TF33 engine and generator. The committee recognizes that ef-
forts are underway to extend the life of TF33 engine. However, it
is unaware of any effort to maintain a supply of 125-kVA genera-
tors to power the engine.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to brief the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, but not later than March 31, 2026, on the current sup-
ply of TF33 engines and generators and any effects the limited gen-
erator supply may be having on the availability of the existing fleet
of B–52H planes. Further, the briefing shall include what effort
will be made to ensure that sufficient generators are available until
the Commercial Engine Replacement Program can provide both
new engines and generators as required for the B–52H mission.
Supporting new entrants and modern approaches to ad-
dress missile inventory
The committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense’s projected inventory of precision-guided munitions is insuffi-
cient to deter or prevail in a conflict with a near-peer adversary.
The committee notes that the current industrial base lacks the ca-
pacity to surge production of affordable weapons systems to fulfill
the quantity demanded within the timeframe required to deter or
win a conflict.
The committee is encouraged by the establishment of the Enter-
prise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, a recent collaboration between
the Air Force Armament Directorate and the Defense Innovation
Unit. The ETV program is prioritizing partnerships with manufac-
turers new to the defense industrial base, using innovative proc-
esses and commercial, off-the-shelf components to enable high-
speed production at scale to meet surges in demand.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than January 31, 2026,

on plans to enter into production contracts with new market en-
trants that employ innovative and cost-effective processes, includ-
ing digital engineering, additive manufacturing, and minimization
of parts counts and supply chain dependencies. This briefing should
also include an assessment of how these manufacturing techniques
can be utilized by other programs of record in the production of ad-
vanced, multi-mission air vehicles.
Tactical ground radars
The committee supports the Air Force’s efforts to field new tac-
tical ground radars capable of detecting a broad range of threats,
from small unmanned aerial systems to hypersonic and missile sys-
tems, as part of a mid-range layered defense. The committee also
recognizes the TPS–75 radar has faced sustainment and mod-
ernization issues. While the Air Force plans to replace it with the
Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar TPY–4 radar,
currently under development, the early retirement of TPS–75 sys-
tems still raises concerns. Delays in TPY–4 fielding, or failure to
meet operational requirements, could create a significant capability
gap, especially as evolving threats demand greater mobility, auton-
omy, networking, and resilience.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026. This briefing shall include: (1) Status
of TPY–4 development; (2) Funds expended to date and required to
complete development of the TPY–4; (3) TPY–4 fielding timeline
and quantity; (4) TPS–75 inventory and mission capability rates
(full and partial); (5) Number of TPS–75 systems needed to prevent
capability gaps; and (6) Efforts to sustain and upgrade the TPS–
75 until full TPY–4 deployment.
UH–60M Black Hawk modernization
The committee notes that in February 2024, the Army an-
nounced its Aviation Rebalance Initiative to reallocate its aviation
modernization investments across new and enduring platforms to
meet emerging capability requirements in a resource constrained
environment. As part of that announcement, the Army committed
to pursuing a new Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) contract starting
in fiscal year 2027 for new UH–60M Black Hawk aircraft when the
current MYP is completed at the end of fiscal year 2026. This new
MYP is needed to ensure adequate inventories of UH–60M heli-
copters for the active Army and the Army National Guard (ARNG),
given the Army’s decision to cancel the UH–60V modification pro-
gram. Even as the Army develops the Future Long Range Assault
Aircraft, the Army has stated that the UH–60M will remain a large
part of the Army’s active and ARNG aviation fleet for decades to
come.
The committee endorses the Army’s efforts to continue to procure
and modernize the UH–60M Black Hawk as part of the future
aviation force. The committee supports Army efforts to prepare for
a fiscal year 2027 MYP, including any long lead or advance pro-
curement actions that can be taken to streamline schedules, main-
tain the supplier base, and secure key components to ensure timely
deliveries.

Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than September 30, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, on measures the Army is taking to support a new
MYP for the UH–60M Black Hawk, including the number of air-
craft to be included in the new MYP, delivery schedules, and con-
tracting in advance for key components and subsystems. The brief-
ing should also include an assessment of the total UH–60M re-
quirement for the active and ARNG aviation fleet in light of the
cancellation of the UH–60V modification program.
Ultra-Lightweight Camouflage Net System
The committee continues to be concerned by the Army’s inability
to centrally fund basic camouflage and concealment for the
warfighter. This has resulted in rotational forces deploying with
30-year-old camouflage technology that is unable to defeat modern
sensor threats. The committee notes that soldiers believe they are
protected and concealed by their camouflage when, in fact, they are
more vulnerable than ever to threat sensors and lethal loitering
munitions. The committee believes that camouflage is inherent to
Army doctrine and, as such, should be procured with strategic in-
tent, and not ad hoc, as unit funding allows.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than February 20, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on the Army’s evaluation of the Ultra-Lightweight
Camouflage Net System for classification as a minimum mission
essential wartime requirement.
Urgent deployment of commercial counter unmanned aerial
systems capabilities for installation protection
The committee is concerned that the military services are not
acting with sufficient urgency to address the growing threat posed
by small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) to Department of De-
fense installations and critical infrastructure. While comprehen-
sive, integrated counter-UAS (cUAS) architectures may be nec-
essary in the long term, the committee is frustrated by the contin-
ued reliance on plodding, service-driven research and requirements
development processes at the expense of near-term protection.
The recent Ukrainian Operation Spiderweb—a coordinated, long-
range drone campaign that struck five Russian airbases deep in-
side sovereign territory—highlights the increasing sophistication,
range, and tactical impact of low-cost, commercially available drone
platforms. The operation demonstrates how peer adversaries or
non-state actors could exploit similar capabilities to threaten U.S.
military installations.
The committee urges the military departments to move aggres-
sively to leverage the growing ecosystem of commercially available
cUAS systems—some of which are already deployed by special op-
erations forces, other federal agencies, and critical infrastructure
operators—to immediately improve protection of high-value mili-
tary facilities. The threat is real, present, and escalating.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than February 1, 2026, to provide a briefing to the Commit-

TITLE II—RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST,
AND EVALUATION
Subtitle A—Authorization of Appropriations
Sec. 201—Authorization of appropriations
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize ap-
propriations for research, development, test, and evaluation activi-
ties at the levels identified in section 4201 of division D of this Act.
Subtitle B—Program Requirements, Restrictions, and
Limitations
Sec. 211—Modifications to defense research capacity build-
ing program
The committee recommends a provision that would require sepa-
rate funding solicitations each focused toward Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Tribal Colleges and Universities
(TCUs), and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI).
The committee notes that currently the Department of Defense’s
program for funding research at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs lumps
funding opportunities together, with no ability to tailor the solicita-
tion to the preferred institution type. Because of the disparities in
size and comprehensiveness of the institutions’ research programs,
the committee believes that having some ability to target and scale
programs based on the outcome desired by the government would
be a useful tool for the Department. The committee believes that
differentiating funding opportunities will allow the Department to
continue to foster and grow the nascent research capabilities of
HBCUs and TCUs while not forcing them to compete directly with
the more established research capabilities of MSIs. The committee
encourages the Department to use this authority strategically in
order both to meet its strategic research goals and to expand and
grow the Department’s overall research capacity to support U.S.
national and economic security goals.
Sec. 212—Program for the enhancement of the research, de-
velopment, test, and evaluation centers of the Depart-
ment of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 305 of title 10, United States Code, by adding a new section,
4145, and codify the authority from section 233 of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328),
which allows eligible centers in the Department of Defense re-
search, development, test and evaluation enterprise to waive cer-
tain policies or regulations if the waiver is demonstrated to in-
crease the efficiency and effectiveness of such organizations and is

Sec. 216—Prohibition on contracts between certain foreign
entities and institutions of higher education conducting
Department of Defense-funded research
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit, be-
ginning on January 1, 2027, any institution of higher education
that conducts research funded by the Department of Defense from
entering into a contract with a covered nation as defined by section
4872(d) of title 10, United States Code, or a foreign entity of con-
cern as recorded on one of the defined lists in the underlying provi-
sion.
Sec. 217—Western regional range complex demonstration
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to carry out a demonstration of a joint, multi-

fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232).
Subtitle C—Plans, Reports, and Other Matters
Sec. 221—Catalyst Pathfinder Program
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Army, not later than January 1, 2027, to establish
a soldier-inspired innovation program that creates partnerships be-
tween operational units of the Army and leading national research
universities to integrate soldiers into early-stage problem identi-
fication and solution development processes.
The committee recognizes the need for a formalized soldier-driv-
en innovation program that integrates soldiers into the research,
development, test, and evaluation process, allowing them to have
touchpoints with new technology and provide feedback to inform
the solutions development process. The provision would also drive
collaboration between operational units of the Army, research uni-
versities, and small businesses to bring more technology solutions
into warfighters’ hands. This program would also support soldiers
with ‘‘maker spaces’’’ where they can engineer their own unique so-
lutions to challenges with their equipment.
Sec. 222—Extension of period for annual reports on critical
technology areas supportive of the National Defense
Strategy
The committee recommends a provision that would extend the re-
porting requirement in section 217(c)(1) of the William M. (Mac)
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year

Budget Items
Army
High Performance Computing Modernization Program
The committee notes that in the section 4201 table for Research
Development Test and Evaluation, Army, there is an increase to
PE 63461A, High Performance Computing Modernization Program
of $50.0 million for additional infrastructure capacity to support in-
creased artificial intelligence demand.
The committee is aware of the Department of Defense’s needs for
additional infrastructure capacity to be able to experiment with
and deploy useful artificial intelligence solutions to meet defense
needs. That includes the needs for additional computing hardware,
expanding connections of the Defense Research and Engineering
Network to additional users for testing and demonstration, and the
need for additional physical and cybersecurity measures to increase
the protection of these systems from vulnerabilities and threats
from sophisticated nation-state actors. The committee also encour-
ages the Department to experiment with new computing architec-
tures in order to reduce energy demands placed on AI data centers
based on current technologies and business practices.

Adaptive threat modeling lab
The committee notes that in the section 4201 table for Research,
Development, Test, and Evaluation, Air Force, there is an increase
to PE 66005F, Digital Transformation Office, of $15.0 million for
the development of an adaptive threat modeling lab to support
operational experimentation of surveillance and counter-surveil-
lance systems in threat representative environments.
The committee is aware that military operations are increasingly
at risk from ubiquitous technical surveillance, which leverages per-
vasive collection of digital data from internet of things (IoT) and
other sensing devices coupled with powerful artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML) tools that allow for greater anal-
ysis and correlation of this extensive digital footprint in ways that
can uncover and compromise military operations. The committee
believes that the military should leverage evolving commercial off-
the-shelf technologies with underpinning AI and ML analytics to
analyze realistic scenarios by establishing a flexible, simulated lab
environment for demonstration, analysis, and operational training.
In such a threat lab environment, operators can study emerging
threats, practice and evolve their tactics, and gain critical insight
into the advantages and vulnerabilities of modern IoT systems.
Defense Wide
Foreign Comparative Test program
The committee notes that in the section 4201 table for Research
Development Test and Evaluation, Defense-wide, there is an in-
crease to PE 63133D8Z, Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) of
$10.0 million to evaluate foreign allied nation artificial intelligence
systems.
The committee notes that the FCT program was established to
identify and evaluate systems or tools produced by foreign allied
nations that could be rigorously tested to determine if they could
meet specific military requirements. The committee believes this is
a cost-effective tool to quickly identify capabilities that can be
adopted by the military without lengthy developmental processes.
In addition, FCT helps strengthen the web of defense relationships
with partners by providing opportunities for them to get appro-
priate capabilities into the U.S. acquisition systems. The committee
encourages the Department of Defense to use the additional fund-
ing authorized by this Act to examine foreign-developed artificial
intelligence and machine learning capabilities, including hardware
and network processing capabilities, to assess the benefits of inte-
grating such systems into the overall networking architecture of
the Department.

crease to PE 61110D8Z, Basic Research Initiatives of $30.0 million
for the Defense Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Re-
search (DEPSCoR) program.
The committee continues to be supportive of the DEPSCoR pro-
gram, which helps build and expand the national innovation base
for research and education by funding research activities in science
and engineering areas responsive to the needs of national defense.
Participation in this program is limited to states that meet eligi-
bility criteria as outlined in the authorizing language from previous
National Defense Authorization Acts. The program is intended to
increase the number of university researchers and improve the ca-
pabilities of institutions of higher education in eligible jurisdictions
to perform competitive research relevant to the Department of De-
fense (DOD). The committee also views DEPSCoR as a component
in any effort by the DOD to identify, shape, and foster innovation
ecosystems that support DOD research and technology needs.
Along with other funding programs and authorities available to the
Department, DEPSCoR should be considered as a means to expand
and diversify the innovation ecosystem for the DOD.
Artificial intelligence algorithmic development utilizing
novel linguistics frameworks
The committee notes that in the section 4201 table for Research,
Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-wide, there is an in-
crease to PE 61228D8Z, Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities/Minority Institutions, of $10.0 million for additional research
in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm development using novel lin-
guistics frameworks.
The committee is aware of opportunities to develop a research
program to investigate the cognitive structural complexity and the
unique linguistics frameworks embedded within indigenous lan-
guages to support development of new and novel AI large language
models. Additionally, the committee notes that these linguistic sys-
tems could be used for developing diverse AI linguistic models that
enable more resilient, more computationally efficient, and more se-
cure AI algorithmic architectures.
Items of Special Interest
Adaptation of air-launched weapons for ground launch
The committee recognizes the urgent need to deliver coordinated
and integrated maritime strike warfighting capability to combatant
commanders. The committee is aware of the AGM–158 JASSM/
LRASM and its survivability and efficacy as a high-end anti-ship
weapon. The committee is also aware of the Family of Affordable
Mass Missiles program and other nascent air- and ship-launched
weapons programs that could be adapted for ground launch, as the
Small Diameter Bomb program was in the Ground-Launched Small
Diameter Bomb program.
The committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acqui-
sition and Sustainment, in coordination with the acquisition execu-
tives of the military services, to provide to the Committees on

demonstrate ground launch of the AGM–158 LRASM, the FAMM
missile, and other nascent weapons.
Advanced Group 1 small unmanned aerial systems
The committee recognizes the role that ultra-lightweight Group
1 small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) can play in supporting
special operations forces (SOF) activities around the world. The
committee believes that SOF units could benefit from ultra-light
Group 1 sUAS that provide secure, modular, and rapidly
deployable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabili-
ties to support intelligence gathering, targeting, and force protec-
tion in contested and denied environments, including through the
employment of light detection and ranging, electro-optical/infrared,
and multi-spectral imaging capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the U.S. Special Oper-
ations Command to seek opportunities to procure and conduct oper-
ational testing of ultra-light Group 1 sUAS capabilities that pro-
vide such aforementioned capabilities, as appropriate.
Biometric collection and analysis
The committee is aware of efforts by U.S. Special Operations
Command (SOCOM) to develop scalable biometric collection and
analysis systems and the use of Partnership Intermediary Agree-
ments to identify relevant and commercially viable, small business-
developed technologies. The committee recognizes the utility of
next-generation biometric collection capabilities that utilize
contactless collection and artificial intelligence-powered analytics
for accelerating the identification of threats, including those posed
by international violent extremists, transnational criminal organi-
zations, and malign foreign actors.
Furthermore, the committee notes that advances in mobile soft-
ware and sensors can enable end-users to adopt, integrate, and
scale new technologies much more cost-effectively. The committee
also recognizes the potential value across a broad range of national
security applications beyond special operations where the avail-
ability of near real-time biometric information on mobile devices
and the ability to utilize software can enable more timely decision-
making. Therefore, the committee encourages continued develop-
ment and enhancement of mobile biometrics software by SOCOM
as appropriate.
Comprehensive inventory of departmental innovation pro-
grams
The committee is aware of the Department of Defense’s wide
array of innovation-focused organizations and initiatives, including
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the De-
fense Innovation Unit (DIU), the Strategic Capabilities Office
(SCO), and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Re-
search and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)). While these entities pursue
valuable and often complementary missions, the lack of a consoli-
dated inventory risks duplication, inefficiency, and suboptimal allo-

sure that emerging technology investments are being prioritized ac-
cording to strategic military needs.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit, not later than March 1, 2026, to the congressional defense
committees a comprehensive report cataloguing all Department-
sponsored technical innovation programs, offices, initiatives, and
pilot projects across all services and defense agencies. This report
shall include:
(1) A complete inventory of innovation-focused organizations
and initiatives, including but not limited to DARPA, SCO,
DIU, OUSD(R&E), service-level innovation cells, Federally
Funded Research and Development Centers, University Affili-
ated Research Centers, and any other Department-affiliated or
Department-supported research and innovation activities;
(2) A description of the mission, budget, and staffing levels
of each program or office, as well as a summary of current re-
search focus areas, active projects, and recent technology tran-
sition outcomes;
(3) An analysis of how these innovation entities coordinate
with one another and with external actors, including industry,
academia, and allied partners;
(4) Identification of any gaps, redundancies, or opportunities
for enhanced collaboration and resource alignment among the
Department’s innovation activities; and
(5) Recommendations, if any, for structural reforms or proc-
ess improvements to streamline innovation efforts, ensure
clearer lines of authority and responsibility, and accelerate the
development and fielding of warfighter-relevant capabilities.
Electromagnetic spectrum overmatch research
The committee is aware of the Army’s Combat Capabilities De-
velopment Command Army Research Laboratory’s engagement in
successful research with university and industry partners in var-
ious aspects of electronic warfare, including efforts to develop tech-
nology for better communications, collections, and sensor data fu-
sion and processing. All are essential capabilities to enhance real-
time accurate decision-making in a highly contested electro-
magnetic spectrum.
The committee strongly supports the continued advancement of
the Army Research Laboratory’s collaborative research with aca-
demia in the development of technology in areas of antennae,
counter-unmanned aerial systems, sensors, computing at the edge,
and swarm technology to enable overmatch electronic warfare capa-
bilities in the highly contested and congested electromagnetic spec-
trum operating environment.
Elevating warfighter capabilities for total force optimiza-
tion
The committee believes that investment in operational health,
readiness, and the performance of U.S. warfighters is critical to en-
suring combat effectiveness against near-peer adversaries. Modern
warfare demands personnel who are not only technically proficient
but also physically and mentally prepared to endure the challenges
of high-intensity combat operations. While existing research has

made strides in injury prevention and performance optimization,
critical gaps remain in understanding the biomechanical, physio-
logical, and psychological factors that influence warfighter
lethality, survivability, and longevity in service. Addressing these
gaps is essential for ensuring force readiness and sustaining oper-
ational effectiveness across all domains of warfare.
In its efforts to sustain warfighter readiness and progress toward
total force optimization, the U.S. Armed Forces must leverage ad-
vancements in science and technology to maximize warfighter oper-
ational effectiveness and reduce injury risks. Therefore, the com-
mittee urges the Department of Defense to support additional re-
search and development focused on optimizing warfighter perform-
ance, including biomechanical, physiological, and psychological re-
search to mitigate injury risks, improve physical resilience, and
maximize readiness, survivability, and lethality in combat oper-
ations.
Future Long Range Attack Aircraft program
The committee supports Department of the Army efforts to estab-
lish improved ability to operate in a contested environment which
requires increased speed, endurance, and reliability.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess the Department of the Army’s Future Long
Range Attack Aircraft (FLRAA) program, addressing the following
elements: (1) The risks in safety, cost, reliability, and performance
the Army has identified through its prototyping of FLRAA; (2) The
extent to which the Army and its contractors applied lessons
learned from the development and operations of the V–22 Osprey
into their development of FLRAA; and (3) The extent to which the
Army is using modern digital engineering tools in the FLRAA pro-
gram to improve the design, reduce risks of accidents, and improve
planning for operations and maintenance.
The committee directs the Comptroller General to provide a
briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later than
April 15, 2026, with a report to follow in a format and time frame
agreed to at the time of the briefing.
Government Accountability Office report on aviation risk
management data
The committee supports efforts to increase safety of U.S. military
flights, including in U.S. civilian airspace. The committee is espe-
cially concerned about recent investigative reporting that a dis-
proportionate amount of aviation close calls in U.S. civilian air-
space involve military aircraft.
To enhance aviation safety in the Department of Defense (DOD),
the committee directs the Comptroller General of the United States
to review Department policy and service policies and procedures for
data gathering, risk assessment, and risk mitigation of U.S. mili-
tary flights, especially as it relates to differentiating between
flights in U.S. domestic civilian airspace, including Class B air-
space, and other missions. This can, in part, be an update from the
2018 Government Accountability Office report on mishap data, but
it should also assess how the Department approaches ex-ante risk
analysis to prevent mishaps.

The review should include but not be limited to the following: (1)
A review of existing databases related to post-hoc mishaps, includ-
ing which services contribute data, the quality and comprehensive-
ness of data, opportunities for gathering more data, and assess-
ment of the rigor of data-gathering approaches; (2) A review of ex-
isting databases related to ex-ante aviation safety and prediction of
risk, including which services contribute data, the quality and com-
prehensiveness of data, opportunities for gathering more data, and
assessment of the rigor of data gathering approaches; (3) An as-
sessment of the methodologies, procedures, and processes used by
the services, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other DOD
agencies to analyze existing data, identifying gaps, concerns, and
opportunities—an assessment that should comment on the rigor-
ousness of these methodologies and procedures, including by com-
paring to best practices in civilian agencies and the private sector;
(4) A review and assessment of the efficacy of guidance and proce-
dures for risk mitigation before flights, detailing any differences
among the services and oversight by other DOD entities, as appli-
cable; (5) A review of whether and how services collect existing
data, methodologies, and risk procedures that differentiate between
missions in U.S. domestic civilian airspace, especially Class B air-
space compared with missions in other locations.
Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate
The committee notes that the Irregular Warfare Technical Sup-
port Directorate (IWTSD) within the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict
conducts rapid research and development in support of Department
of Defense (DOD) requirements, including those of special oper-
ations forces. The committee further notes that the joint explana-
tory statement accompanying the Servicemember Quality of Life
Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) directed the Secretary of Defense
to submit a plan for optimizing the contributions of the IWTSD to
the fulfillment of DOD irregular warfare activities.
The committee notes the growing importance of unmanned sys-
tems to the operational effectiveness of special operations forces
across the continuum of competition and conflict. The committee
understands that U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command (NSW),
acting through Special Boat Team–22, has undertaken activities fo-
cused on experimentation and prototyping related to unmanned
maritime capabilities. The committee believes there may be oppor-
tunities for enhanced collaboration between IWTSD and NSW on
unmanned maritime experimentation and prototyping. Therefore,
the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Spe-
cial Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the Commander,
U.S. Special Operations Command, to provide a briefing to the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee, not later than December 31, 2025,
on opportunities for IWTSD to complement innovation efforts by
NSW for research, experimentation, and prototyping unmanned
maritime vessels.

Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics activities
The committee recognizes that the nation’s defense capabilities
and economic strength are intrinsically linked to its ability to inno-
vate and produce advanced technologies domestically and that
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) edu-
cation is a cornerstone of this capability. The committee also notes
that the House Report accompanying H.R. 8070 (H. Rept. 118–529)
of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–
159) directed the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
Readiness to provide a report to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
March 1, 2025, providing insight into the feasibility of a STEM-spe-
cific Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) program.
The committee notes that the report issued by the Department
of Defense should emphasize the benefits of integrating STEM-re-
lated subjects and activities into JROTC programs and other simi-
lar programs that support military-connected students; encourage
the identification and dissemination of best practices related to
STEM across JROTC and other programs serving military-con-
nected students; and encourage the program to leverage, where fea-
sible, the capacities of not-for-profits and educational institutions
as they support JROTC and other programs serving military-con-
nected students.
The committee urges the Department of Defense to submit the
report as soon as possible.
Low-cost hypersonic testing
The committee remains concerned with the lack of progress by
the Department of Defense in developing capabilities for hypersonic
weapons, as well as the technology and systems needed to counter
or defeat such weapons. The committee notes the work of the
Comptroller General of the United States in the report published
on July 29, 2024, titled ‘‘DOD Could Reduce Cost and Schedule
Risks by Following Leading Practices’’ (GAO–24–106792). The com-
mittee notes that the Comptroller General recommended the De-
partment utilize ‘‘Digital Twinning’’ to reduce cost and schedule
risks.
The committee is aware that such digital twin technology re-
quires verified computational simulations for hypersonics, which in
turn have reduced maturity and accuracy when detailed flight test
data is absent. The committee applauds the Department for initi-
ating the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed
program as a means to increase the pace and scale of hypersonic
testing, producing more of the necessary flight test data needed to
increase the fidelity overall for modeling and simulation tech-
nologies, including for digital twins. Therefore, the committee en-
courages the Department to continue to seek out low-cost
hypersonic testing opportunities to validate these models.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Research and Engineering to develop a plan to utilize dig-
ital twin technology in hypersonic design and to evaluate and as-
sess the defense industrial base’s capability and capacity to support

digital twinning for hypersonics capability development and oper-
ational simulation. The committee directs the Under Secretary to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than January 31, 2026, on the following: (1) The Depart-
ment’s plan to incorporate digital twins for advancing hypersonic
design and fielding; (2) Current digital twin models utilized by the
Department; (3) The Department’s investments in obtaining accu-
rate hypersonic flight test data; (4) An assessment of the defense
industrial base’s ability to build accurate digital twins for
hypersonic system design; and (5) The Department’s plan to utilize
the three components of hypersonic design: analytical and computa-
tional models, flight testing, and ground testing.
Navy Modular Missile Solid Rocket Motors
The committee believes that the Navy Modular Missile (NMM)
program is a critical opportunity for the Navy to establish a strong
foundation for developing and maturing future weapons systems.
The committee encourages the Navy to develop and produce the
NMM in a manner consistent with the Secretary of Defense’s com-
mitment to Congress to ‘‘leverage market forces to prioritize com-
petition and maximize innovation and efficient production.’’ Be-
cause the NMM program contemplates a common weapon system
with different solid rocket motors (SRM) for different missions, the
Navy has an opportunity to leverage an expanding SRM industrial
base effectively to support large-scale production of the NMM.
The committee recognizes that programs with multiple qualified
sub-tier suppliers are adaptable and resilient. Programs with mul-
tiple qualified SRM providers can take advantage of competition,
minimize the impacts of supply chain disruptions, scale production
efficiently, and respond to dynamic warfighting needs.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy, in
consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Sustainment, to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than December 1, 2025, on a plan to invest in qualifying
at least two domestic SRM manufacturers for each configuration of
the NMM. The briefing should address how this investment will be
incorporated in the NMM acquisition strategy to accomplish these
policy objectives. The briefing should be unclassified without dis-
semination restrictions but may contain a classified or restricted
annex.
Next-generation printed circuit boards
The committee is aware that the Department of Defense (DOD)
lacks reliable, domestic sources of supply for printed circuit boards
(PCBs), which are critical components underpinning the electronics
that power all of our weapons systems. Numerous studies by the
DOD and other agencies have documented the critical need to
strengthen domestic PCB and printed circuit board assembly man-
ufacturing to ensure a secure and reliable supply chain of these
critical technology components. The Department has also recog-
nized the importance of domestic sources of these vital parts, with
individual awards under the Defense Production Act of 1950 (Pub-
lic Law 81–774) to try to stimulate investment in the manufacture

of these technologies. Further, the committee notes that the Execu-
tive Agent for Printed Circuit Board and Interconnect Technology
was established in section 256 of the Duncan Hunter National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110–417)
to ensure both a secure supply of PCBs, as well as to maintain
deep technical understanding of the technology to help inform the
Department.
The committee is also aware that the Department has leveraged
the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) to support some capacity ex-
pansion for manufacturing of next generation PCBs. Next genera-
tion PCBs are needed not only to increase the supply chain security
of such technology, but also to take advantage of advances in need-
ed technology to modernize the substrates and manufacturing proc-
essing for PCBs to incorporate changes like the incorporation of
new materials, optical interconnects, and 3D heterogenous integra-
tion. The committee believes an opportunity exists to leverage the
innovative financing opportunities of organizations like OSC, the
Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and the Defense Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency (DARPA) to leap ahead in the space of
PCBs.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy, act-
ing through the Executive Agent for Printed Circuit Board and
Interconnect Technology and in coordination with the Directors of
the OSC, DIU, and DARPA; the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Industrial Base Policy; and the Principal Director for Microelec-
tronics in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research
and Engineering, to develop a roadmap and investment strategy for
next-generation PCBs and to provide a briefing to the congressional
defense committees, not later than June 1, 2026. Such briefing
shall include: (1) Identification of technological advances that
might require new technical approaches for PCB design and manu-
facture, including from foreign partners or allies; (2) Emerging re-
search in new PCB design, including internationally; (3) Survey of
private capital investment opportunities in current and next-gen-
eration PCBs; (4) Assessment of technical integration challenges
and opportunities for next-generation PCBs; and (5) Other such
considerations as the Executive Agent for Printed Circuit Board
and Interconnect Technology considers appropriate.
Project Pele
The committee is encouraged by the continued progress made by
the Department of Defense Strategic Capabilities Office on Project
Pele, an effort to design, build, and demonstrate a prototype mobile
micro nuclear fission reactor. In particular, the committee notes
the advancements made by Project Pele to meet the requirement
of demonstrating the ability of mobile nuclear power generation
technologies to comply fully with all relevant regulations and statu-
tory requirements, satisfy stakeholder needs, and operate safely in
real-world conditions.
Accordingly, given the continued investments in the mobile micro
nuclear reactor program, the committee encourages the Depart-
ment of Defense to consider using Project Pele as the technical
baseline for future micro nuclear fission reactors.

Finally, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not later
than May 1, 2026, to brief the congressional defense committees on
Department efforts to expedite and expand efforts to prototype and
evaluate advanced deployable nuclear energy systems capable of
supporting forward-deployed military forces, expeditionary mis-
sions, and resilient base operations. Such briefing shall address, at
a minimum:
(1) A Department-wide strategy to identify and develop
deployable nuclear energy solutions;
(2) A timeline for prototyping and initial testing of one or
more reactor designs;
(3) The means by which the Department will coordinate ef-
forts with other state and Federal agencies, as necessary; and
(4) The military requirements and key performance param-
eters for each separate design to be pursued.
Quantum algorithm development
The committee recognizes the importance of the Defense Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum
Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) program in making progress to de-
termine whether fault-tolerant utility-scale quantum computers
could plausibly be realized ahead of conventional predictions. The
committee also notes that while progress is being made on the
hardware underpinning quantum computing, the Department of
Defense also needs to be prepared with useful and functional algo-
rithms to operate on those machines once they do become available.
The committee believes the Department should be making such in-
vestments in parallel in order to maximize the benefits of quantum
computing should the investment manifest in a utility-scale ma-
chine. The committee supports DARPA’s efforts with QBI and en-
courages the program to identify industry performers to explore al-
gorithm development for quantum computing applications to en-
sure the maturation of that part of the industrial base.
Accordingly, the committee believes that advances in quantum
algorithms have the potential to enhance the ability to
computationally design and discover new advanced materials for a
broad set of national security applications across the Department
and the military services, among other applications.
Quantum benchmarking initiative
The committee notes that quantum computing has been identi-
fied as a critical technology where the United States must main-
tain its leadership. The committee strongly supports the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum
Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) as well as the consideration of all
relevant quantum computing technologies, including both gate-
model and annealing approaches, that have the potential to reach
utility-scale. The committee expects the DARPA Director to ensure
QBI evaluates all quantum computing modalities, within budgetary
and resource constraints, to determine the maturity and long-term
potential of quantum computing concepts, development plans, and
prototypes, components, and subsystems needed to develop a util-
ity-scale quantum computing capability.

Removing barriers to directed energy weapon system test-
ing, training, and exercising
The committee supports the continued development and fielding
of directed energy weapon systems as a critical component of future
U.S. military capabilities. These systems offer scalable, non-kinetic
options to address a range of operational challenges.
The committee, however, is concerned that current policies and
overly restrictive interpretations of legal authorities may unneces-
sarily limit the Department of Defense’s ability to conduct realistic
testing, training, and exercises with directed energy systems, even
in low-risk environments with only consenting participants. To ad-
dress these concerns, the committee supports efforts to thoughtfully
delegate appropriate approval authorities and remove barriers to
such activities when they do not pose risks to foreign relations,
arms control compliance, or nonconsenting parties. The committee
believes that continued, focused oversight will support faster inte-
gration of directed energy capabilities into the force.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026.
This briefing should include: (1) A summary of current testing,
training, and exercise activities involving directed energy weapon
systems across the Department of Defense; (2) Identification of pol-
icy, legal, or procedural barriers limiting such activities; (3) A re-
view of current approval authorities and their delegation; and (4)
Recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes needed to
facilitate broader operational use of directed energy weapons.
Researcher post-employment restrictions
The committee is concerned that the current level of oversight
and coordination between the Department of Defense and other rel-
evant federal agencies may not be robust enough when it comes to
assessing the potential impact of post-employment activities of re-
searchers who have participated on sensitive unclassified projects
funded by the Department but may be approached by foreign enti-
ties of concern for prospective employment. The committee notes
the potential benefits which a foreign government could receive if
such researchers accept employment with foreign entities of con-
cern after the conclusion of their research.
The committee further notes that there are existing processes for
research security that could support visibility into the breadth and
scope of this issue and help mitigate risks to broader national secu-
rity, though some of those processes are managed by interagency
partners. Therefore, the committee encourages the Department to
strengthen policies for research security to maintain visibility of
post-employment activities of Department-funded or Department-
employed researchers on unclassified topics and to mitigate any
negative impacts through increased synchronization with inter-
agency partners with authorities in this space.
University research

rity of the United States, as well as our military effectiveness, de-
pends on sustained technological superiority. The committee also

understands that technological superiority is directly supported by
federally funded research conducted at our nation’s universities
that fuel the future science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics workforce.
The committee believes universities, university affiliated re-
search centers (UARCs), and their partners serve as trusted, long-
term partners to the Department of Defense (DOD), maintaining
specialized capabilities essential to mission success that are not
readily available in the commercial sector. The committee agrees
with the assessment of the Government Accountability Office in its
report from December 2018 titled ‘‘Defense Laboratory Authorities:
DOD Uses Authorities to Support Science and Technology, but
Could Strengthen Its Approach (GAO–19–64)’’ that UARCs enable
DOD to ‘‘maintain essential capabilities’’ and gain access to re-
search ‘‘where the private sector may not have sufficient incentive
to invest.’’
Therefore, the committee strongly recommends sustained invest-
ment by the Department in university research, including UARCs
and their partners, to ensure the United States maintains its edge
over near-peer competitors in emerging technologies and critical de-
fense capabilities. The committee further believes these invest-
ments have achieved positive outcomes in day-to-day operations of
the Department, including repairs to ships, submarines, ground ve-
hicles, aircraft, and weapons systems; air, land, and sea warfare;
arctic operations, healthcare, additive manufacturing, advanced
materials, hypersonics, directed energy, artificial intelligence, and
data analysis, accelerating readiness and increasing effectiveness
for the entire force.

The committee recommends a provision that would repeal section
343 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022
(Public Law 117–81).
Sec. 320—Interim responses to address releases or threat-
ened releases of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
stances

tions relating to the detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS)
substances on Department of Defense installations, and determine
interim actions to be taken to reduce immediate public exposure to
the release of PFAS. The provision would also require a report re-
garding various elements related to the preliminary assessment or
site investigation of facilities, their associated timelines, and any
relevant explanations of actions taken.
Subtitle C—Logistics and Sustainment
Sec. 321—Surface ship sustainment and readiness
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to enhance surface ship maintenance at pri-
vate shipyards through processes led by the Type Commanders
(TYCOMs) that emphasize workforce stability, ship-specific assign-
ments, collaborative planning, and small business involvement. The
provision would authorize the TYCOMs to oversee maintenance
and delegate decision-making authority to project managers, port
engineers, and ship commanding officers. The requirements under
this section would terminate on January 1, 2031.
The committee supports the Navy’s goal of achieving 80 percent
surge combat readiness for both conventional and nuclear ships, as
well as the Navy’s commitment to improving maintenance, repair,
and overhaul processes. The committee is concerned, however, that
the Navy’s contracting strategy with the private shipyards has led
to inefficiencies in planning and executing sustainment activities.
Moreover, it has led to workload instability that disincentivizes
capital and workforce investments. The committee is also con-
cerned with the diffusion of authority, responsibility, and account-
ability that has prevented timely decision making and integrated
management under an organization charged with the man, train,
and equip functions for the fleet. The committee believes that im-
plementing this provision would help alleviate these concerns.
Sec. 322—Technology enhancement for surface ship mainte-
nance
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to expedite the investigation, qualification,
and integration of specified advanced technologies and processes
into Navy surface ship maintenance to improve readiness, reduce
costs, and address delays. The provision would also: (1) Mandate
an open process for evaluating additional technologies within 90
days of their submission; (2) Require updated policies and modified
contracts; and (3) Require information on implementation timelines
and third-party reviews for non-selected technologies. The provision
would require the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
Congress, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act, detailing timelines to qualify and approve each ad-
vanced technology or process specified in the provision.

Sec. 323—Delegation to United States Transportation Com-
mand of mitigating vulnerabilities and risks associated
with contested logistics for Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would designate
U.S. Transportation Command as the global manager for contested
logistics. The provision would also require an interim briefing on
progress and a report within 1 year on implementation of this des-
ignation.
The committee has been discouraged by the lack of a cohesive,
unified strategy by the Department of Defense. The committee be-
lieves that this course of action, similar to the designation of a sin-
gle manager for bulk fuel, would streamline the Department’s ef-
forts and create a renewed pathway to achieving a capability to
provide logistics support for U.S. Armed Forces in a contested envi-
ronment.
Sec. 324—Requirements for Department of Defense aircraft
operations near commercial airports
The committee recommends a provision that would require all
aircraft of the Department of Defense that operate near commercial
airports to be equipped with position broadcast technology. The
provision would require the development of standard operating pro-
cedures that maximize the use of such technology. Finally, the pro-
vision would require annual reports describing near miss incidents
involving military and commercial aircraft.
Sec. 325—Extension and modification of semiannual brief-
ings on operational status of amphibious warship fleet
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 352 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) by extending the sunset date for the re-
porting requirements on the operational status of the amphibious
warship fleet from 2026 to 2028 and by including an additional re-
quirement to report on a plan for maintenance and service life ex-
tensions that would retain active amphibious warships until re-
placement warships enter service in order to meet the requirement
for operationally available amphibious warships set forth in section
8062 of title 10, United States Code.
Sec. 326—Prohibition on closure of Army organic industrial
base sites
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of Defense from closing any facility or sites that are part
of the Army’s organic industrial base. Not later than 120 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for
5 years, the Secretary of the Army shall submit to the congres-
sional defense committees a report on the status of all facilities in
the organic industrial base of the Army.

Sec. 328—Integration of commercially available artificial in-
telligence capabilities into logistics operations
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to facilitate the integration of commercially
available artificial intelligence capabilities specifically designed for
logistics tracking, planning, operations, and analytics into two rel-
evant Department of Defense exercises to be conducted during fis-
cal year 2026.
Sec. 329—Pilot program on arsenal workload sustainment
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a pilot program, for a period of
5 years, on arsenal workload sustainment within the Department
of Defense.
Subtitle D—Reports
Sec. 331—Modification of report on improved oversight for
implementation of Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization
Program of the Navy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 355(c)(2)(A) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) to include information on digital
infrastructure in the annual reporting requirement on the Depart-
ment of the Navy’s Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program.
Sec. 332—Modification of readiness report to include sum-
mary count of certain mishaps
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 482(b)(8) of title 10, United States Code, to reduce overburden-
some reporting requirements in the Semiannual Readiness Report
to Congress (SRRC). Previously, the SRRC included case-by-case
descriptions of each Class C mishap. The committee’s intent is to
streamline the SRRC and eliminate the case-by-case descriptions
for Class C mishaps but still retain a summary count of all Class
C mishaps.
Sec. 333—Annual report on funding and status of interim re-
medial actions of Department of Defense relating to
perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
on the funding and status of interim remedial actions of the De-
partment of Defense relating to per- and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
stances, including criteria for prioritizing military installations
based on risk to human health, environmental impact, and prox-
imity to affected communities.

Subtitle E—Other Matters
Sec. 341—Provision of sports foods and third-party certified
dietary supplements to members of the United States
Special Operations Command
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to use amounts authorized to be appropriated
to the Department of Defense for Major Force Program 11 for the
procurement of sports foods and third-party certified dietary sup-
plements and the distribution of such foods and supplements to
servicemembers of the U.S. Special Operations Command. The pro-
vision would also direct the Secretary to conduct a review of the
feasibility and advisability of expanding such an authority to the
military departments and submit the findings of such review to the
congressional defense committees, not later than September 30,
2026.
Sec. 342—Limitation on use of funds to establish or expand
Space Force Special Operations Component Command
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated by
this Act or otherwise made available for Major Force Program 11
for the U.S. Special Operations Command to establish or expand a
Space Force Special Operations Component Command until the
date that is 30 days after the date on which the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict
and the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command, in con-
sultation with the Chief of Space Operations, submit to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives a report articulating the requirement for such a com-
ponent command and the resourcing, personnel, and other require-
ments necessary for reaching initial and full operational capability.
Sec. 343—Requirements for contracts relating to permanent
change of station moving process
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to include additional oversight mechanisms
for any renegotiation of the contract under the Global Household
Goods Contract in place as of the date of the enactment of this Act,
or negotiation of a new contract under the Global Household Goods
Contract or any successor program or contract.
The committee is concerned that the original Global Household
Goods Contract lacked proper oversight mechanisms leading to an
inability of the Department of Defense to safeguard the best inter-
est of servicemembers and their families.
Sec. 344—Limitation on transformation by the Army of pri-
mary helicopter training program at Fort Rucker, Ala-
bama
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of the Army from implementing any transformation of
the Initial Entry Rotary Wing training program until certain re-
porting requirements are met.

The committee recommends a provision that would grant the Air
Force permissive authority to convey five surplus T–37B aircraft to
the Arizona Aviation Historical Group at no cost to the Govern-
ment.
Sec. 346—Limitation on use of funds by the Army until sub-
mittal of plan to integrate Joint Munitions Command
and Army Sustainment Command
The committee directs the Secretary of Army to provide a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, prior to the expenditure of the funds authorized
to be appropriated to restructure commands, on its proposed plan
to integrate the Joint Munitions Command and the Army
Sustainment Command.
Sec. 347—Limitation on use of certain funds of the Air Force
until acquisition strategy submitted to maintain Air-
borne Command Post capability
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 travel funds for the Sec-
retary of the Air Force until the Secretary of the Air Force submits
a report on the acquisition strategy of the Air Force to maintain
the Airborne Command Post capability.
Sec. 348—Pilot program for contracted amphibious air re-
sources for the area of responsibility of the United
States Indo-Pacific Command
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to establish and maintain a 3-year pilot pro-
gram for the contracted operation of a fleet of commercial amphib-
ious aviation resources for tasking within the area of responsibility
of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.
Sec. 349—Naming of certain assets of the Department of De-
fense in the Commonwealth of Virginia
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to implement the naming recommendations
for assets of the Department of Defense located in the Common-
wealth of Virginia that were adopted by the base naming commis-
sion.

encroachment and reduces threats to military installation resil-
ience. The committee anticipates that the military services will
identify validated requirements for fiscal year 2026 in excess of the
$158.3 million requested. Additionally, the committee encourages
the military services to establish and resource additional staff to
increase capacity to more effectively implement available REPI
funds and to take full advantage of the benefits of the REPI pro-
gram to improve military readiness and military installation resil-
ience.
Items of Special Interest
Advanced software for Navy and Marine Corps readiness
data
The committee applauds the Army and the Air Force for deploy-
ing advanced software platforms with capabilities that allow com-
manders and servicemembers to track, monitor, and better inform
unit readiness reporting for personnel, equipment, status of that
equipment, and training. The Army and the Air Force’s ability to
derive insights from this data better informs and enhances unit
readiness reporting.
The committee encourages the Navy and the Marine Corps to de-
ploy similar technologies that will enable unit commanders to le-
verage similar benefits to better inform their readiness reporting.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
brief to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on plans
to deploy advanced software that enables the tracking, monitoring,
and improvement of key metrics to align with the overall readiness
objectives for the Department of Defense.
Aerial firefighting enhancement
The committee recognizes that fire season is year-round and that
additional resources are required to suppress catastrophic
wildfires. The lack of availability for spare parts hampers some
state, local, and private sector entities in conducting aerial wildfire
suppression missions. Additionally, the sale of parts could help the
United States maintain its existing aerial firefighting aircraft fleet.
The committee notes that Congress originally adopted such a provi-
sion in 1996 but that the authority expired in 2005. Congress again
authorized such authority in 2012, but that authority lapsed in
2017.
The committee notes that in 2025, the President signed a bill,
the Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act of 2025 (Public Law 119–
8), that authorized a new 10-year period for the Secretary of De-
fense to sell excess Department of Defense aircraft and aircraft
parts to persons or entities that contract with the Government for
the delivery of fire retardant or water by air to suppress wildfires.
This law requires that such aircraft or spare parts be used only for
wildfire suppression.
The committee recognizes the importance of this new authority
and encourages the Department to use this law to actively respond
to the growing wildfire crisis. The committee believes this law will
strengthen national readiness for wildfire response and suppres-

sion during the year-round fire season. The committee will con-
tinue to monitor the implementation of this legislation and work
with the Department to determine if additional legislation is need-
ed.
Army field-level maintenance in a contested environment
The committee notes that the Army is moving toward a division-
based force to better position ground forces for large-scale combat
operations. Theater armies, corps, and divisions need to take the
lead in coordinating large-scale campaigns against well-armed na-
tion-states, with brigade-level forces fully focused on winning the
direct force-on-force engagements. The committee believes that the
Army’s ability to sustain operations while under fire means that
forces at all levels will need to be able to repair battle-damaged
tanks, personnel carriers, trucks, and other ground vehicles—espe-
cially when the ability to reach back to the United States for depot
maintenance, personnel support, and supplies is contested.
At the same time, the committee understands that the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s preliminary work on an ongoing report
has shown that field-level maintenance is growing more complex
and challenging because the Army is fielding multiple ground vehi-
cle variants. Given these and other challenges, the committee is in-
terested in further examining the Army’s plans for ensuring its
combat units are effectively organized, trained, and equipped to
perform field-level maintenance when operating in a contested en-
vironment.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller General of
the United States to assess the following: (1) How the Army is ad-
justing its field maintenance forces to sustain large-scale combat
operations in a contested environment; (2) The extent to which the
Army has identified and addressed field-level maintenance chal-
lenges at the brigade, division, corps, and theater levels through
combat training center rotations and warfighter exercises for fight-
ing in a contested environment; (3) The extent to which the Army
has provided its field maintenance forces with the tools, technology,
training, and equipment they need to perform field maintenance
when operating in a contested environment; and (4) Any other re-
lated matters the Comptroller General considers appropriate.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than April 1, 2026, on the Comptroller General’s preliminary find-
ings and to present final results in a format and timeframe agreed
to at the time of the briefing.
Army strategy and requirements for wildfire suppression
mission
The committee notes that over the last 10 years, wildfires in the
United States have grown in frequency, size, destructive capacity,
and cost. Given the threat of more frequent and larger wildfires,
communities increasingly rely on U.S. Army personnel in signifi-
cant numbers to augment dwindling U.S. Forest Service fire-
fighting capabilities. In 2024 alone, more than 2,000 Army Active,
Guard, and Reserve personnel were deployed to carry out wildfire
suppression duties, including direct firefighting and suppression,

air and ground logistics support, and evacuations and security. In
January 2025, 1,200 personnel from the Washington Army Na-
tional Guard were activated to address the wildfires that destroyed
more than 18,000 homes and other structures in southern Cali-
fornia. Unfortunately, this mission emerged so quickly that the
U.S. Army did not have time to develop requirements for wildfire
response. Consequently, U.S. Army units received inconsistent
training and dangerously outdated equipment to meet the fire-
fighting mission.
As the frequency, scope, and destructive power of wildfires con-
tinues to grow, U.S. Army personnel continue to be called upon to
protect American communities. The committee understands that
deploying home-stationed U.S. Army units for this mission is in-
creasingly essential for successful wildfire suppression missions in
support of communities around the country facing wildfire threats.
However, the committee is concerned that the Department of De-
fense has not methodically assessed this emergent mission and
lacks a strategy and requirements for meeting it. In particular, the
committee is concerned that, absent a formal wildfire firefighting
requirement, the U.S. Army will continue to rely on equipment,
provided by other agencies, that does not meet U.S. Army stand-
ards designed to protect readiness and ensure effective operations
of units deployed to meet this mission.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 1, 2026, on the U.S. Army’s strategy and
requirements for meeting the emergent wildfire suppression mis-
sion. The briefing should include: (1) The current process for pro-
curing mission-specific equipment, such as load carriage, for Active,
Guard, and Reserve units; (2) A strategy and timeline for assessing
the quality and suitability of equipment currently issued to ensure
mission readiness and mitigate fatigue and injury; and (3) An as-
sessment of the needs and benefits of establishing a formal U.S.
Army requirement for wildfire response, including the opportunity
to procure appropriate equipment.
Blast exposure and weapons sensors for Special Operations
Forces
The committee notes that U.S. Special Operations Command
(SOCOM) is working to identify blast overpressure exposure result-
ing from heavy weapons systems use, breaching, and small arms
in dynamic combat and training environments. However, the com-
mittee understands SOCOM’s knowledge of the effect of blast expo-
sure may be limited by lack of objective blast exposure monitoring
data. The committee also notes that the cumulative effects of small
arms and crew-served weapons use may contribute to brain inju-
ries.
The committee believes the development of new sensors, includ-
ing sensors enabled by artificial intelligence, may enable greater
understanding of blast overpressure events and the cumulative ef-
fect of other weapons on the long-term health of special operations
forces.
Therefore, the committee encourages the Commander, SOCOM,
to continue testing and fielding, as appropriate, blast exposure and

other weapons sensors to support the safety and welfare of special
operations forces.
Additionally, the committee directs the Commander, SOCOM, to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than December 31,
2025, regarding blast exposure and weapons sensor development
efforts, including testing and potential plans for fielding of such
sensors.
Briefing on activation of power projection wings by U.S. Air
Force Special Operations Command
The committee notes that the U.S. Air Force Special Operations
Command is in the process of establishing power projection wings
with the objective of more effectively supporting the requirements
of the geographic combatant commanders.
Accordingly, not later than March 1, 2026, the committee directs
the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command, and the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Inten-
sity Conflict, to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the sta-
tus of the activation of power projection wings. At a minimum, the
briefing should identify: (1) Roles, responsibilities, and anticipated
missions of the power projection wings; (2) The personnel, aircraft,
and equipment that will be transferred from other installations to
support the activation of power projection wings; (3) Any additional
resourcing or authorities that may be needed to complete the acti-
vation of power projection wings; and (4) Any other matters
deemed relevant by the Commander and Assistant Secretary.
Briefing on advanced manufacturing
The committee notes that innovations in advanced manufac-
turing have the potential to make producing parts for weapons and
weapons systems faster, cheaper, more customizable, and more mo-
bile than existing, traditional manufacturing techniques. The com-
mittee understands that metal and polymer-based advanced manu-
facturing processes have the potential to change the way the Joint
Force plans combat and sustainment operations. Integrating ad-
vanced manufacturing capabilities as an inherent foundational
sustainment capability and proliferating access to advanced manu-
factured products to every operational unit will shorten logistics
tails and timelines, decrease maintenance costs and delays, and
empower each warfighter with the tools and equipment they need
to execute their missions more efficiently and effectively.
The committee believes that the establishment of the Joint Addi-
tive Manufacturing Working Group in 2017 and the release of the
first Department of Defense (DOD) Additive Manufacturing Strat-
egy in 2021 were important steps toward capitalizing on innova-
tions in advanced manufacturing. Since the release of the strategy,
however, the DOD has made modest investments in advanced man-
ufacturing technologies and methods relative to the potential out-
sized impacts that advanced manufacturing can have on military
operations, maintenance, sustainment, and logistics, should the ca-
pability be proliferated widely. The committee believes the Depart-
ment should accelerate efforts to develop common technology,

standards, and processes for advanced manufacturing that will en-
able the military services to share data and increase readiness with
the goal of proliferating advanced manufacturing capabilities
across units at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Secre-
taries of the military departments and the Director of the Defense
Logistics Agency, to provide a briefing, not later than February 1,
2026, on: (1) How the military services currently determine how
advanced manufacturing capabilities are deployed; and (2) Chal-
lenges to equipping operational units with advanced manufacturing
capabilities for maintenance and repair in the field.
Briefing on Defense Language and National Security Edu-
cation Office and future planning for foreign language
programs
The committee recognizes that, in partnership with universities
and senior military colleges across the country, the Defense Lan-
guage and National Security Education Office provides important
training for servicemembers for the purposes of accelerating the de-
velopment of foundational expertise in critical and strategic lan-
guages and regional area studies. The committee notes that these
programs support critical language acquisition and training for the
U.S. active duty military, National Guard and Reservists, other De-
partment of Defense personnel, Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
(ROTC) cadets and midshipmen, and U.S. graduate and under-
graduate students who are committed to federal service.
The committee notes with concern that, due to budget con-
straints, fewer programs were funded in fiscal year 2024. In the
case of Language Training Centers, no programs are expected to be
funded in fiscal year 2025, reducing capacity at higher education
partners and significantly limiting access to critical and strategic
languages including Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and Korean. Fur-
ther, the committee believes these constraints present challenges
for retention and recruitment of existing program infrastructure ca-
pabilities and qualified academic instructors with the language flu-
ency and expertise in the areas of the world critical to current and
long-term U.S. national security interests. The committee believes
the inroads made by higher education partners such as the Univer-
sity of Mississippi, the University of Rhode Island, the University
of Arizona, and James Madison University, as well as many others,
are crucial to sustaining and growing these vital programs, but
adequate resources are required. The committee is concerned that
despite section 575 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) amending the statute au-
thorizing the Language Training Center to require the Secretary of
Defense to carry out the program, the Department failed to budget
any funding in fiscal year 2025, effectively halting the program.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the congressional defense committees, not later than January
1, 2026, on maintaining critical and strategic language proficiency
for servicemembers and ROTC students. This briefing shall in-
clude: (1) Optimal requirements for training in languages and cul-
tures critical to national security, to include the necessary funding

levels to meet and sustain such requirements; (2) An evaluation of
the Department’s readiness posture as it relates to language capa-
bilities; (3) The capacity to increase strategic languages in response
to emerging language requirements; and (4) The Department’s
funding plan across the future years defense program for the Lan-
guage Flagship Program, Project Global Officer, Language Training
Centers, and Boren Awards.
Further, the committee encourages the Department to continue
placing a high priority on the Language Flagship Program, Project
Global Officer, Language Training Centers, and Boren Awards,
with an emphasis on quality of instruction and a preference for
programs that provide college credit and have strategic value to
U.S. national security interests.
Briefing on software development and acquisition capabili-
ties for U.S. Special Operations Command
The committee notes the critical role that software plays in ena-
bling military capabilities, including those of U.S. Special Oper-
ations Forces. However, the committee is concerned that U.S. Spe-
cial Operations Command (SOCOM) may require more robust soft-
ware development and acquisition capabilities to fulfill special op-
erations-peculiar requirements.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Commander, SOCOM, in
coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Sustainment, to provide a briefing, not later than December
31, 2025, to the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the
feasibility and advisability of establishing more robust software de-
velopment and acquisition capabilities, sometimes referred to as a
software factory, to enable the fielding of special operations-pecu-
liar software solutions, enhance cyber security, and support the
classified defense technology projects of SOCOM. At a minimum,
the briefing should address: (1) The extent to which the establish-
ment of such software development and acquisition capabilities
would improve the development and acquisition of software to ful-
fill special operations-peculiar requirements; (2) The resources, fa-
cilities, personnel, and authorities that would be required to estab-
lish such software development and acquisition capabilities; (3)
How SOCOM software development and acquisition capabilities
would augment, coordinate with, and add value to existing Depart-
ment of Defense software development activities; (4) Whether the
establishment of such SOCOM software development and acquisi-
tion capabilities would facilitate the recruitment and transition of
qualified personnel into full-time employment with SOCOM and
other elements of the Department of Defense, including through in-
ternship opportunities; and (5) Any other matters deemed relevant
by the Commander, SOCOM.
Comptroller General review of capabilities and planning for
sensitive crisis response operations
The committee notes that the joint posture statement for 2025
provided to the committee by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the Com-
mander, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) states, ‘‘In
the past three years, the requirements for SOCOM to fulfill its cri-

sis response remit increased more than 170% over the previous
decade’s annual average . . . Presidentially directed crisis response
operations are inherently unpredictable and vary year-to-year in
timing, duration, and total cost. Operational and logistics costs for
crisis response increased more than 250% from FY20 to FY23. With
increases in the frequency of crises and compounded costs, SOCOM
has paid for previous crises response deployments, drawing away
from SOCOM’s total modernization efforts that aim to meet future
challenges.’’
The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense
(DOD) has not planned or budgeted for the increased use of and
reliance on crisis response forces, including responding forces and
critical enabling support. Specifically, it is unclear if the DOD has
budgeted appropriately and sustainably for these operations or if it
has taken needed steps to ensure crisis response forces maintain
appropriate levels of readiness and availability. Therefore, the com-
mittee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to re-
view the DOD’s planning and budgeting for sensitive crisis re-
sponse operations by assessing: (1) Effects of changes in the stra-
tegic environment on guidance, preparation, and planning for sen-
sitive crisis response operations; (2) Trends in the number and na-
ture of sensitive crisis response operations and corresponding read-
iness impacts to responding units and enabling support; (3) As-
sumptions the DOD and other agencies make for enabling support
for sensitive crisis response operations; (4) Processes and proce-
dures that the DOD and other federal agencies follow when plan-
ning and budgeting for sensitive crisis response operations to en-
sure resources, personnel, and exquisite capabilities are available;
(5) Plans that the DOD may have for responding to multiple simul-
taneous crises that require intelligence and sensitive activity capa-
bilities and the extent to which the DOD has coordinated these
plans with other relevant agencies; and (6) Other matters that the
Comptroller General deems to be relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives not later than April 1, 2026. A
determination of a final product will be made at the time of those
briefings.
Expanding Arctic training
The committee notes that much of the Department of Defense’s
(DOD) Arctic expertise resides in the reserve components, including
the National Guard. The committee further notes, however, that
the DOD will need to rely on the capabilities and expertise pro-
vided by the total force to achieve success in the Arctic. To operate
in the changing Arctic environment, the committee believes that
the Joint Force must have the requisite skills, training, and experi-
ence.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
submit a report to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than January 15, 2026, on locations in which the Army could estab-
lish or expand Arctic training and exercises in order to test soldiers
and equipment to meet requirements for operating in Arctic and
cold weather conditions. The report should include additional sites

to conduct the Army’s Cold Weather Orientation Course, Cold
Weather Leader Course, and Isolation Survival in Cold Regions
Course. Additionally, the report should examine tactical, technical,
and logistical challenges unique to operating in extreme cold
weather conditions and how additional cold weather training loca-
tions would impact readiness.
Feasibility of floating drydock
The committee recognizes the critical strategic and logistical role
public shipyards play in the security of the Nation. The committee
strongly supports efforts to modernize and improve facilities at the
Navy’s four public shipyards, including the multi-mission dry dock,
and to address the complex maintenance needs of the Navy’s cur-
rent and future active fleet. The current modernization plans for
Navy shipyards include converting dry docks to focus on depot-level
maintenance for nuclear submarines.
To better understand the Navy’s options for a floating dry dock
to address any infrastructure shortfalls, the committee directs the
Secretary of the Navy to provide a briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than March 1, 2026, detailing:
(1) Potential locations for mooring a floating dry dock;
(2) A list of the individual major military construction
projects needed to support a floating dry dock;
(3) The earliest a floating dry dock could be brought into
service and a description of constraints; and
(4) How a floating dry dock would be used to ensure extra
capacity for potential crisis in the event of a military conflict.
FireGuard
The committee continues to support the FireGuard program as
an essential tool for federal, state, and local firefighters to aggre-
gate, analyze, and assess multi-source remote sensing information
for interagency partnerships in the detection and monitoring of
wildfires, given their increasing frequency and scope of damage
across the United States.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 1, 2026, identifying where in the Department of
Defense FireGuard should reside as a program of record. The brief-
ing should also include: (1) A plan for funding and manning to the
levels required; (2) The number and names of states, territories,
counties, municipalities, and tribal governments to whom
FireGuard has provided fire intelligence services; (3) A comparative
analysis of polygons provided by FireGuard for wildfires and end-
state perimeters of the same wildfires; (4) An analysis of the time
between detection via raw satellite data and the alerts being sent
to local responders; and (5) A review of efforts undertaken to inte-
grate emerging satellite and aerial surveillance technologies from
qualified private, nonprofit, and public sector sources.
Guam invasive species mitigation
The committee notes the importance of Guam in supporting the
forward presence of U.S. forces. The committee further notes that
the Department of Defense relies on equipment and infrastructure

that is currently deployed to Guam and that the tyranny of dis-
tance can lead to long lead times for replacement parts.
The committee understands that Guam is currently combatting
the Vespa Tropica, or the greater banded hornet, which is an
invasive species that was first discovered on the island in 2016.
The committee further understands that this species is extremely
aggressive and can wreak havoc on mission critical systems, such
as aircraft engines and generators, which would lead to degraded
readiness for potentially long periods of time. As a major inter- and
intra-theater logistical point for the Indo-Pacific region, Guam also
has the potential to serve as a source of spread for such invasive
species to other areas, if mitigation or eradication measures are not
taken seriously.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
coordination with relevant local authorities, to provide a one-time
briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than
November 3, 2025, on an action plan to combat the greater banded
hornet, and any other similar invasive species, to help mitigate po-
tential readiness concerns. Such a briefing should include the fol-
lowing: (1) A plan for a baseline survey for mapping nest occur-
rences to identify infestation areas, as well as the parties with re-
sponsibility over those areas; (2) A plan for conducting a baseline
scientific survey on greater banded hornet territory area to deter-
mine colony size, life cycle, and seasonality in order to estimate the
eradication planning needs for required personnel, technology,
eradication strategy, and other safety concerns; (3) An estimate of
personnel hours, technology, and resources needed for each phase,
including for post-eradication verification and potential long-term
management issues; and (4) A plan for consultation with local au-
thorities from other areas facing similar infestations to apply les-
sons learned and propose efficiencies leveraging prior and current
efforts, including with outside groups that specialize in etymo-
logical infestations.
Head and hearing protection for aircraft maintenance per-
sonnel
The committee understands that head and hearing protection
systems are widespread across the Department of Defense. How-
ever, occupational safety extends beyond traditional combat arms
roles and should also include protective measures for personnel in
career fields such as aircraft maintenance. The committee recog-
nizes that the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps require head im-
pact and hearing protection for maintenance personnel working on
or near military aircraft. This requirement has proven to be an ef-
fective tool in mitigating the risk of injuries in dynamic and haz-
ardous work environments. However, the committee understands
that U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force maintenance personnel are not
currently required to wear similar protective gear while working on
military aircraft. While fall-prevention systems are often in use,
they do not fully address the risk of impact injuries to the head
and neck, prevent long-term hearing loss, or provide necessary eye
protection. With widely available solutions already in existence,
such as those already fielded by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine

Corps, the committee believes that U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force
maintainers should be provided with similar protective capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretaries of the Army
and Air Force to coordinate a joint brief to the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1) Each service’s
current policies on head and hearing protection for maintenance
personnel working on or near military aircraft; (2) An assessment
of injury rates and risk factors related to head trauma and hearing
loss in aviation maintenance career fields; and (3) A plan for evalu-
ating and potentially fielding commercial head protection solutions
to address these risks.
Inclusion of personal protective equipment and organiza-
tional clothing and individual equipment items in Army
Transformation in Contact
The committee supports U.S. Army efforts to accelerate oper-
ational testing and integration of emerging, commercially available
capabilities into its Transformation in Contact (TIC) initiative and
to identify opportunities to provide funding more efficiently across
capability sets. The committee also applauds the U.S. Army’s ef-
forts to incorporate a range of environments and climate conditions
in its experimentation.
The committee notes its longstanding support of the Soldier En-
hancement Program (SEP) as a rapid innovation pipeline for sol-
dier gear and equipment. As designed, the SEP has served as an
effective process designed to help the U.S. Army move at ‘‘the
speed of industry’’ by evaluating existing prototypes or commer-
cially available items that could enhance soldiers’ ability to execute
their combat mission. The SEP continues to serve a unique and
critical function in enabling the accelerated evaluation and pro-
curement of off-the-shelf items that have the potential to substan-
tially improve weapons and support equipment that are focused on
critical war-fighting functional areas of fires, mission command,
movement and maneuver, sustainability, and protection. In par-
ticular, the committee believes that personal protective equipment
(PPE) and organizational clothing and individual equipment
(OCIE) should be included in U.S. Army TIC efforts given the ro-
bust availability of commercial, off-the-shelf PPE and OCIE alter-
natives.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, on how the U.S. Army is including PPE and OCIE into its
TIC efforts and how the U.S. Army is leveraging existing programs
such as the SEP to facilitate and expand rapid operational testing
of those items.
Interagency integration on Arctic planning, testing, and op-
erations
The committee recognizes that the Arctic region presents geo-
political challenges and opportunities affecting national security in-
terests and is supportive of efforts to better understand the emerg-
ing needs for enhanced operations in the Arctic region. The com-
mittee encourages the Secretary of Defense to seek opportunities to

partner with interagency organizations, the Center for Arctic Secu-
rity and Resiliency, and the Joint All Domain Weather Operations
Center, to coordinate Federal agency planning for Arctic operations
as well as testing of systems to support Arctic operations.
Intermittent fault detection and isolation technology
One of the major cost drivers for the Department of Defense
(DOD) is the maintenance of electronics and electrical systems that
control and operate a wide range inventory of weapons and weapon
systems. The Department spends billions per year maintaining
electronics and electronic systems. One of the highest contributing
causes for these costs is operationally induced intermittent elec-
tronic faults that result in no fault found, cannot duplicate, or no
trouble found test results—essentially false readings to the effect
that there is no problem. Per a Department report to Congress
dated October 5, 2021, ‘‘Assessment of Electronics Maintenance as
a Leading Driver of Weapon Systems Non-Availability’’, there is an
available test technology that could detect and reverse the inter-
mittent fault problem across the spectrum of DOD weapon systems
with the initial targets being various aircraft, including the F–35,
F–16, and F/A–18. Additionally, a January 14, 2020, Government
Accountability Office report titled ‘‘Senior Leaders Should Empha-
size Key Practices to Improve Weapon System Reliability’’ (GAO–
20–151) highlighted the major improvements in flight hours, repair
times, and cost savings that resulted from the use of the tech-
nology.
Accordingly, the committee recommends that the Department
sustain funding for this critical intermittent fault detection and iso-
lation technology.
Military working equid report
The committee understands that the U.S. Army intends to elimi-
nate all military working equid detachments other than the Cais-
son units at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Joint Base San An-
tonio, and the mules at the United States Military Academy. These
detachments did not fall under formal authorization documents
and were, therefore, perpetually under-resourced and lacked suffi-
cient oversight. While, in response to committee urging, the U.S.
Army initiated more rigorous, centralized oversight by U.S. Army
veterinarians, the U.S. Army has continued to manage and re-
source these detachments in an ad hoc manner. As a result, there
remains high risk to the safety and welfare of the equids and insuf-
ficient resources. The committee is concerned that the U.S. Army
did not conduct rigorous analysis or consider the historic signifi-
cance of these detachments in its decision to disestablish. Addition-
ally, previous U.S. Army efforts to retire military working equids
have been marred by mismanagement and lack of concern for equid
welfare after the end of their service to the U.S. Army.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a report, not later than January 15, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives that includes the following:
(1) A description, to include home station, of all military
working equid (MWE) detachments eliminated;

(2) The detailed analysis that led to the U.S. Army’s decision
to disestablish MWE detachments, including:
(a) A detailed review of the health of the herd in each
location, to include information on the health of each
horse, nutrition and fitness, as well as an assessment of
turnout and space requirements and whether host installa-
tion possessed necessary space;
(b) A detailed assessment of borrowed military man-
power and necessary manpower required at each detach-
ment, to include cost and how manpower needs were deter-
mined;
(c) A detailed cost assessment for the facility and oper-
ational requirements for each program, broken out by in-
vestments made in prior years, estimates for necessary fu-
ture improvements to facilities, and standard operating
costs required to maintain each detachment as appropriate
to their mission;
(d) A description of consultations between U.S. Army
leadership and host unit, installation, community, and as-
sociated historic military unit association conducted as
part of the U.S. Army’s decision; and
(e) Any other matters the Secretary determines relevant;
and
(3) A description of the U.S. Army plan, to include timelines,
processes for assessing suitability, and conditions to be met be-
fore a determination is made, to transition a MWE associated
with disestablished detachments out of care by the U.S. Army.
Northern Strike Exercises
The committee notes that the annual Northern Strike Exercise
is a large, all-domain reserve forces exercise. The committee be-
lieves it provides a realistic, decisive action training environment
as well as robust training experiences for units and leaders to
strengthen joint all-domain warfighting capabilities. Further, it
fills a critical gap in resourced readiness building multi-domain ex-
ercises for National Guard combat formations. Resident within the
State of Michigan, Northern Strike is conducted twice a year (win-
ter and summer) within the four-season National All-Domain
Warfighting Center’s contested multi-domain operating environ-
ment. Using a combination of integrated live, virtual, and construc-
tive models and simulations, participants increase Mission Essen-
tial Task proficiencies and build readiness through repetitive task
iterations at echelon by training for combat operations as part of
the joint team. The committee believes that Northern Strike is at
the forefront of unmanned aerial systems and counter unmanned
aerial systems training that provide individual servicemembers
critical exposure to current, real-world threats.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Department of De-
fense to establish recurring funding for this critical exercise series.
Operational energy
The committee notes that longer operating distances, remote and
austere geography, and anti-access/area denial threats have chal-
lenged the Department of Defense’s (DOD) ability to deliver fuel.
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:16 Jul 19, 2025 Jkt 061121 PO 00000 Frm 00109 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6602 E:\HR\OC\SR039.XXX SR039

Without fuel, the DOD cannot deploy and sustain forces around the
globe. Reducing these burdens, even if just in the margins, enables
warfighters to be more lethal. As such, the committee supports re-
ducing the footprint of the Joint Force in expeditionary operations,
which increases the survivability of warfighters while reducing
strain on sustainment requirements.
For example, the Air Force saved at least $124.0 million in fiscal
year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2019 using operational energy
advances. Microvanes on C–17 aircraft reduce drag by about 1 per-
cent, pay for themselves in just 7 months, and save at least $12.7
million each year in fuel costs. Unfortunately, the committee un-
derstands that microvanes are currently on only 10 C–17 aircraft.
Aft body drag reduction devices on C–130 aircraft yield about $18.0
million in fuel savings each year. KC–135 finlets reduce drag by
about 2 percent yet save $13.2 million each year. Mission planning
software programs like Jigsaw and Pythagoras lead to about 10
percent improvements in flight efficiency across the fleet.
The committee notes that the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft
is a promising design that can operate more efficiently in contested
environments by offering at least 30 percent more aerodynamic ef-
ficiency versus a 767. The committee understands that the BWB of-
fers 90 percent more range, a 94 percent increase in fuel offload ca-
pability at a 2,500 nautical mile radius resulting in increased fight-
er sortie generation, upwards of 50 percent more fuel efficiency,
takes up 40 percent less space on airfields, flies 2,000 feet higher,
and requires less landing and takeoff distance. Beyond these tac-
tical benefits, the BWB design would save the Air Force at least
$900.0 million per year on fuel.
The committee notes that on the ground, hybrid vehicle capabili-
ties offer longer operational duration and lower fuel consumption.
For example, the Army successfully demonstrated a hybrid tactical
vehicle in Europe last winter that operated a brigade command
post for 10 days on just 10 gallons of fuel.
Accordingly, the committee continues to support energy demand
reduction efforts and programs that extend the operational reach
for warfighters and enable our military’s lethality and readiness.
Organic industrial base expansion
The committee remains convinced of the imperative to accelerate
the modernization and expansion of the Army’s organic industrial
base. To ensure that the Army is moving forward with this effort,
the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to provide a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on the Army’s
plans and way forward on establishing production lines for: (1) A
secondary domestic source of military-grade nitrocellulose; or (2)
Any of 13 precursor chemicals used widely across the Joint Pro-
gram Executive Office Armaments & Ammunition portfolio that are
currently sourced solely from China; or (3) Producing any of the
300 chemicals identified as single point failures by the Joint Pro-
gram Executive Office Armaments & Ammunition; or (4) A load
and pack facility capable of servicing multiple calibers of ammuni-
tion; or (5) A combination of the above options.

This report should include the Army’s plans to either modernize,

Quantum sensing technologies for addressing perfluoroalkyl
and polyfluoroalkyl contamination
Over 700 U.S. military sites are known to have, or known to
have likely, discharged per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals.
The committee notes that current available methods to detect
PFAS include gas or liquid chromatography, which is expensive,
time consuming, and unsuitable for on-site testing or identification.
In November 2024, the Strategic Environmental Research and De-
velopment Program (SERDP) released a Statement of Need to de-
velop a real-time sensor for detecting and quantifying PFAS chemi-
cals, which would allow for more time- and cost-efficient site inves-
tigations and remediation. To date, no field-based rapid screening
technologies are commercially available for PFAS detection. While
the Department of Defense (DOD) has significantly invested in
PFAS remediation, current detection methods are limited by cost,
speed, and sensitivity.
The committee is encouraged by the potential promise of quan-
tum technology to fill this gap. Quantum sensors can leverage the
principles of quantum mechanics to achieve levels of extreme preci-
sion that were previously considered unattainable. In this context,
quantum science could be used to help detection platforms achieve
unprecedented sensitivity and allow for ultra-sensitive, real-time
detection and mapping of PFAS in soil and groundwater.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, in coordination
with the SERDP and the Environmental Security Technology Cer-
tification Program, to brief the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March
15, 2026, on:
(1) The technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and perform-
ance potential of quantum sensing technologies for the detec-
tion and monitoring of PFAS at DOD sites;
(2) A comparison of quantum sensing capabilities with exist-
ing and emerging technologies for the detection of PFAS;
(3) A framework for integrating quantum sensing with strat-
egies for remediating PFAS, including sensor-informed deg-
radation approaches; and
(4) Recommendations, as appropriate, for next steps to accel-
erate the development, deployment, and transition of quantum
sensing tools for environmental monitoring and cleanup of
PFAS.

cluding any additional safeguards to protect servicemembers and
civilian personnel; and (3) Recommendations for improving existing
infrastructure, practices, and policies to ensure a safer working en-
vironment, ultimately protecting the health and well-being of mili-
tary personnel and civilian employees exposed to hazardous mate-
rials during these operations.
Special Operations Digital Force Protection
The committee notes that adversaries increasingly exploit the
commercial digital surveillance economy as a low-cost, low-risk
method of targeting U.S. forces. By reducing U.S. forces’ digital sig-
nature exposure and adversary tracking, digital force protection
strengthens overall force protection, operational security, and stra-
tegic deception efforts across all domains of warfare. The committee
believes digital force protection is a critical enabler of multi-domain
operations, ensuring that U.S. forces can operate seamlessly across
land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace without adversarial digital ex-
ploitation undermining mission success. Effective digital force pro-
tection also imposes costs on adversaries by complicating their abil-
ity to detect, track, or exploit U.S. personnel and assets through
commercial data aggregation, as well as related open-source intel-
ligence, signals intelligence, and adversarial artificial intelligence-
powered analytics.
The committee believes that U.S. Special Operations Forces
(SOF) are especially vulnerable to adversarial exploitation of the
commercial digital surveillance economy and ubiquitous technical
surveillance (UTS) capabilities given the sensitive, multi-domain
operations they carry out globally.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the
Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to pro-
vide the congressional defense committees a briefing, not later than
October 1, 2025, which includes: (1) An assessment of the threat
posed by UTS to the force protection and mission effectiveness of
SOF; (2) A description of ongoing or planned efforts by SOCOM to
address the threat posed by UTS; (3) An assessment of available
technical solutions to address the threat posed by UTS, including
government-owned and commercially available technologies; (4) A
description of any challenges to address the threat posed by UTS,
including Department of Defense policies, authorities, and
resourcing; and (5) Any other matters deemed relevant by the As-
sistant Secretary and the Commander.
Survival, evasion, resistance, and escape complex
The committee notes the importance of Survival, Evasion, Resist-
ance, and Escape (SERE) training for U.S. Army aviators during
the course of their training at Fort Novosel. The committee is con-
cerned that continued delays in completing this essential training
facility could adversely impact the readiness of deployed U.S. Army
aviators.

Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 1, 2026, on the progress and timeline
for completion of the SERE training facility at Fort Rucker.
United States-made Army training aircraft
The committee understands that the Army is considering
transitioning the Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) pilot training
to a contractor owned and operated training model, as part of its
Flight School Next initiative. The committee is aware that such a
change may result in the use of a new primary training helicopter.
The committee appreciates the use of domestically manufactured
helicopters in IERW pilot training and, therefore, urges the Army
to ensure that any new contract for IERW pilot training is per-
formed on a domestically produced helicopter.
Wing additive manufacturing
The committee notes that wing-level additive manufacturing
(AM) capability provides a significant increase in mission readiness
and meets the demands of aircraft maintainers with cost and time
savings compared to legacy repair methods and supply system al-
ternatives. The committee believes that expanding this organic ca-
pability is necessary for our Nation’s premier conventional and nu-
clear long-range strike force to maintain peak mission readiness
and to support strategic deterrence.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the U.S. Air Force to es-
tablish AM facilities at additional installations to better support
conventional and nuclear long-range strike platforms and mission
support systems. The committee believes this will improve aircraft
readiness and decrease reliance on lagging supply chains, better
enabling aircraft maintainers to conduct timely and precision re-
pairs.

The provision would also establish limits on the number of tem-
porary technicians authorized to be employed within the end
strengths set forth by this section to not more than 25 percent of
the total authorized strength for each component.
The provision would also prohibit the coercion of a military tech-
nician (dual status) by a State into accepting an offer of realign-
ment or conversion to any other military status, including as a
member of the Active, Guard, and Reserve program of a reserve

TITLE V—MILITARY PERSONNEL POLICY
Subtitle A—Officer Personnel Policy
Sec. 501—Statutory adjustment to reflect transfer of certain
general officer billets from the Air Force to the Space
Force
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 526(a) of title 10, United States Code, to increase the author-
ized maximum number of Space Force brigadier generals by three
and reduce the authorized maximum number of Air Force brigadier
generals by three, in response to the transfer of responsibilities
from the Air Force to the Space Force.
Sec. 502—Notice of removal of Judge Advocates General
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 7037, 8088, and 9037 of title 10, United States Code, to re-
quire the Secretary of Defense to submit a minimum of 5 days no-
tice to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives that a Judge Advocate General is being
removed and a statement of the reason for the removal.
Sec. 503—Qualifications for judge advocates
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 806 of title 10, United States Code (Article 6 of the Uniform
Code of Military Justice), to require judge advocates to be admitted
to the practice of law before the highest court of a State, Territory,
Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia and to maintain an ac-
tive license to practice before such court, subject to the jurisdic-
tion’s disciplinary requirements and in compliance with such other
requirements as the cognizant authority has set to remain eligible
to practice law. The provision would also authorize the Judge Advo-
cates General of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, as
well as the Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine
Corps, to suspend the authority of judge advocates in their respec-
tive services to perform legal duties if such officers become non-
compliant with such requirements. The provision would also pro-
hibit any judge advocate or legal officer who is suspended or dis-
barred from the practice of law within a jurisdiction from per-
forming legal duties.
The committee notes the importance of judge advocates main-
taining baseline qualifications and competence in order to execute
their duties as legal professionals.

Sec. 504—Modification of waiver authority related to joint
qualified officer requirement prior to promotion to gen-
eral or flag grade
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 619a(b)(3) of title 10, United States Code, to remove the ex-
plicit authority of the Secretary of Defense to waive the require-
ment that an officer be joint qualified prior to promotion to general
or flag officer for officers in medical-related specialties. The com-
mittee notes that the Secretary will continue to have authority to
waive this requirement for the good of the service.
Sec. 505—Notification of removal of officers from selection
board reports and promotion lists
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 618, 629, and 14111 of title 10, United States Code, to require
notification to the Congress when officers are removed from selec-
tion board reports and lists for reasons other than misconduct.
Sec. 506—Space Force general officer management
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 525 and 526 of title 10, United States Code, to address the
composition of the Space Force without component as authorized by
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Pub-
lic Law 118–31).
Specifically, this provision would amend section 525 of title 10,
United States Code, to clarify that distribution limits apply only to
Space Force general officers serving on sustained duty orders and
to authorize up to two general officers to serve for more than 1
year but not more than 3 years in non-sustained duty roles without
counting against statutory limits.
Additionally, this provision would amend section 526 of title 10,
United States Code, to allow the Secretary of the Air Force to au-
thorize up to two general officers in active status to serve for a pe-
riod between 180 and 365 days in non-sustained duty roles and to
account for transitional periods for officers departing sustained
duty assignments so they are not counted against statutory limits.
Finally, this provision would add a new section 20110 to title 10,
United States Code, to authorize up to five Space Force general of-
ficers to serve in an active status but not on sustained duty.
Sec. 507—Temporary increase in fiscal year percentage limi-
tation for reduction or waiver of service-in-grade re-
quirement for general and flag officers to be retired in
pay grades O–7 and O–8
The committee recommends a provision that would temporarily
increase authorizations for general and flag officer time-in-grade
waivers for retirement.

Subtitle B—Reserve Component Management
Sec. 511—Expansion of authority to waive limitations on re-
lease of reserves from active duty within two years of
retirement eligibility
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 12686(b) of title 10, United States Code, to authorize a mem-
ber of a reserve component to waive the limitation on release from
active duty within 2 years of retirement eligibility when ordered to
active duty (other than for training) for up to 365 days, providing
greater flexibility for the services to effectively manage operational
needs without using active-duty funds for short-term requirements.
Sec. 512—Disestablishment of Navy Reserve Center system
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Navy or their designee to disestablish the Navy
Reserve Center system and return administrative readiness func-
tions to Navy reserve unit commanding officers or Navy reserve
community managers, as appropriate. Additionally, the provision
would direct the Secretary of the Navy or his or her designee to
reassign servicemembers assigned to the Navy Reserve Centers to
other duty assignments within the Navy or to transfer them to the
Individual Ready Reserve, as appropriate. This provision addresses
the changes in leadership roles within the Navy reserve system
and does not otherwise imply any limitations on the use for other
purposes of physical buildings currently being used for Navy re-
serve centers.
The committee is concerned that the Navy Reserve Center sys-
tem duplicates workforce requirements traditionally overseen by
Navy reserve unit commanders and thereby artificially inflates the
annual Navy reserve end-strength requirement. The committee
notes that this has resulted in a confusing, duplicative, and bifur-
cated chain of command that is contrary to Navy custom and tradi-
tion and to sound organizational management practices.
Moreover, the committee is aware of multiple instances where
Navy Reserve Centers have failed to perform basic readiness func-
tions for Navy reserve units, including by losing paperwork; assign-
ing additional administrative requirements to personnel that are
inconsistent with statute and regulation; refusing to perform unit
urinalysis; failing to respond to emails or complete administrative
processes related to essential personnel, pay, and mobilization ac-
tions; and being unaccountable to Navy reserve unit commanding
officers who have raised these issues with Navy Reserve Center
commanding officers.
Therefore, the committee is concerned that the Navy Reserve
Center system has resulted in inefficiency, increased costs, and an
overall decrease in mobilization readiness.
Sec. 513—National Guard personnel authorities
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary concerned to promulgate regulations to authorize an offi-
cer or warrant officer in the National Guard who fills a vacancy in
a federally recognized unit to be transferred from the active Na-
tional Guard to the inactive National Guard. The provision would

also allow such officers to transfer from the inactive National
Guard back into a federally recognized unit of the National Guard.
Sec. 514—National Guard personnel disaster response duty
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 3 of title 32, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of
Defense to authorize Governors to direct National Guard personnel
performing Active Guard and Reserve duty to conduct disaster re-
sponse duties under certain conditions for up to 14 days, while en-
suring that such duties do not interfere with primary responsibil-
ities.
Subtitle C—General Service Authorities and Military
Records
Sec. 521—Chief of Naval Personnel
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 8081 of title 10, United States Code, to require the Chief of
Naval Personnel to be responsible for the overall management,
oversight, and administration of Navy military and civilian employ-
ees.
Sec. 522—Enhanced efficiency and service discretion for
Disability Evaluation System reviews
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 524 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2022 (Public Law 117–81) to authorize the Secretaries of the mili-
tary departments to require a statement of contention as part of a
servicemember’s appeal of a physical evaluation board’s fitness for
duty determination. The provision would also allow the Secretaries
of the military departments to decide whether a formal appeal will
be reviewed through a records examination or an impartial appel-
late hearing. Additionally, the proposal would amend section 1214
of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Secretaries of the
military departments to require a statement of contention when a
servicemember requests a full and fair hearing before being retired
or separated due to physical disability.
Sec. 523—Technical correction related to convalescent leave
for academy cadets and midshipmen
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 702 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the provision
of convalescent leave to military service academy cadets and mid-
shipmen.
Sec. 524—Recognition of remotely piloted aircraft crew
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretaries of the military departments, in consultation with the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to establish a status identifier or
equivalent recognition to denote the combat participation of re-
motely piloted aircraft crew members who conduct operations in di-
rect support of combat missions.

The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish and implement a policy to ensure
that military-connected registered sex offenders are identified to
the military community where they work or live, including through
the use of agreements with State and local authorities. The policy
would be required not later than 1 year after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act.
The provision would also require the Secretary to assess the fea-
sibility and desirability of legislation designating the Department
of Defense as a jurisdiction under the Sex Offender Registration
and Notification Act (title 1 of Public Law 109–248).
Sec. 532—Quarterly reports on sexual assault prevention
and response efforts
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit a quarterly report on the activities,
progress, and performance metrics of the Sexual Assault Preven-
tion and Response Office.
Subtitle E—Member Education, Training, and Transition
Sec. 541—Military service academy nominations
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 7442(a), 8454, and 9442(a) of title 10, United States Code, to
clarify that Members of Congress may rank-order all persons that
a Member is permitted to nominate for appointment to a military
service academy.
Sec. 542—Asynchronous instruction in distance education
option for professional military education
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2154 of title 10, United States Code, to require that virtual
learning pathways in distance education programs under such sec-
tion must be offered asynchronously.
The committee notes that the mission of professional military
education programs within the Department of Defense is to train
military officers to operate as effective thinkers, strategists, plan-
ners, problem solvers, and operators in a joint warfighting environ-
ment. To the extent that the service war colleges offer a remote ad-
vanced degree program to fulfill this joint training requirement, in
order to ensure the effective administration of such a program for
reserve component personnel, the committee directs the services to
make use of modern best practices in remote graduate education by
including an asynchronous option for mandatory lecture course
components.

Department of Defense to manage the Secretary of Defense Stra-
tegic Thinkers Program (STP) and to provide annual briefings to
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on the administration of the STP, with the first
briefing to take place not later than January 12, 2026.
Sec. 545—Improvements to information-sharing to support
individuals retiring or separating from the Armed
Forces
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 570F of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2020 (Public Law 116–92) to strengthen information sharing with
State veterans agencies by establishing an opt-out framework.
Sec. 546—Mandatory training on government ethics and na-
tional security law
The committee recommends a provision that would require an-
nual training for members of the Armed Forces on ethics and
standards of conduct, as well as training for servicemembers on the
law of armed conflict, rules of engagement, defense support to civil
authorities, standing rules for the use of force, and the Code of
Conduct, as applicable, including within 90 days of a mobilization
or deployment.
Sec. 547—Prohibition on consideration of race, sex, color,
ethnicity, national origin, or religion in service academy
admissions decisions
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit mili-
tary service academies from considering race, sex, color, ethnicity,
national origin, or religion in admissions decisions.
Sec. 548—Prohibition on participation of males in athletic
programs or activities at the military service academies
that are designated for women or girls

Secretary of Defense to ensure that the military service academies
do not permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an ath-
letic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.
Sec. 549—Pathway for cadets and midshipmen to play pro-

Sec. 551—Certain assistance to local educational agencies
that benefit dependents of military and civilian per-

The committee recommends a provision that would authorize
$50.0 million in operation and maintenance, Defense-wide, for con-
tinuation of the Department of Defense (DOD) assistance program
to local educational agencies impacted by the enrollment of depend-
ent children of military members and DOD civilian employees. The
provision would also authorize $10.0 million in operation and main-
tenance, Defense-wide, for impact aid payments for children with
disabilities as enacted by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106–398), using
the formula set forth in section 363 of that Act, for continuation of
DOD assistance to local educational agencies that benefit eligible
dependents with severe disabilities. Furthermore, the provision
would authorize the Secretary of Defense to use an additional $20.0
million for payments to local educational agencies determined by
the Secretary to have higher concentrations of military children
with severe disabilities. Finally, the provision would require the
Secretary to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
September 30, 2026, on the Department’s evaluation of each local
educational agency with higher concentrations of military children

Sec. 553—Enrollment of children of certain American Red
Cross employees in defense dependents’ education sys-
tem
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1404(d)(1) of the Defense Dependents’ Education Act of 1978
(Public Law 95–561) to authorize children of employees of the
American Red Cross who are performing, on a full-time basis, serv-
ices for the Armed Forces, enrollment in a Department of Defense

to direct DODEA schools to offer to administer, and, if such an
offer is accepted, administer at least one college admissions test to
each student in the eleventh grade of the parent’s choice.
Sec. 556—Support for expanding early childcare options for
members of the Armed Forces and their families
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to direct the Secretaries of the military de-
partments to: (1) Identify gaps between existing early childcare
needs and available eligible childcare providers; (2) Use resources
of the Department of Defense to support eligible childcare providers
in recruitment and retention of employees; (3) Seek to enter into
an interagency partnership with a federal agency with the ability
to place national service participants and volunteers at military
child development centers; and (4) Provide training and resources
subsidies to eligible childcare providers.
Sec. 557—Improved counseling and access to information re-
lating to foster care for military families
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to: (1) Require that all counselors assigned to
a Family Advocacy Program or Military and Family Life program
at a military installation be trained in the requirements and re-
sources relating to foster care in the state in which the installation
is located; (2) Require the inclusion of foster care information on

Sec. 558—Pilot program on recruitment and retention of em-
ployees for child development programs
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a pilot program to
assess the effectiveness of increasing compensation or other bene-
fits for employees of child development programs on military instal-
lations.
Sec. 559—Report on unmet need for childcare in areas with
significant populations of members of the Armed Forces
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, not later than September 30, 2027, to submit
a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives on the unmet need for childcare in
certain areas.
Part II—Other Matters
Sec. 561—Legal assistance for guardianship transfers
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretaries of the military departments to provide members of the
Armed Forces serving on active duty access to legal services pro-
vided by an attorney specializing in guardianship transfers in each
state in which a military installation is located. The provision
would also require the Secretaries of the military departments to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than September 1,
2026, with: (1) An implementation plan to provide access to the
legal services required by the provision; (2) Any challenges associ-
ated with implementation; (3) Data on the number of members of
the Armed Forces with guardianship of incapacitated adult depend-
ents, or a plan to gather such data; and (4) Any other matters the
Secretaries of the military departments consider relevant.
Subtitle G—Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
Sec. 571—Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps instructor
qualifications
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary concerned from issuing a policy under section
2031(d)(1)(B) of title 10, United States Code, that would require
more than 8 years of service before a former officer or noncommis-
sioned officer may be approved to serve as a Junior Reserve Offi-
cers’ Training Corps instructor.
Sec. 572—Temporary authority to provide bonuses to Junior
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps instructors

agrees to be a Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps instructor
for at least 1 academic year.
Sec. 573—Number of Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps units
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 545(a) of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public
Law 118–159) to increase the number of required Junior Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps units to at least 3,600 and no more than
4,200.
Subtitle H—Decorations and Other Awards, Miscellaneous
Reports, and Other Matters
Sec. 581—Honorary promotions on the initiative of the De-
partment of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1563a of title 10, United States Code, to rescind the discretion
of the Secretary of Defense to make honorary promotions and au-
thorize the Secretaries of the military departments to make an
honorary promotion, including a posthumous honorary promotion,
if the honorary grade given to a servicemember is commensurate
with a servicemember’s contributions to the Armed Forces or the
national defense and if the Secretary of a military department re-
ceives a favorable recommendation by a board of at least three
independent officers convened specifically to review the proposed
honorary promotion. This authority shall not be used to award an
honorary promotion solely on the basis that a servicemember was
recommended for such promotion prior to separating from service.
The committee is concerned with potential misuse of the hon-
orary promotion authority. Honorary promotions are intended for
exceptional or unusual circumstances, rather than as preferential
treatment unrelated to service or exceptional circumstances.
Sec. 582—National Week of Military Recruitment
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 1 of title 36, United States Code, to designate the last full week
of September as the National Week of Military Recruitment.
Sec. 583—Clarifying the calculation of enlistments for per-
sons whose score on the Armed Forces Qualification
Test is below a prescribed level for the future service-
member preparatory course
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 546 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to clarify how individuals who improve
their Armed Forces Qualification Test scores through the Future
Servicemember Preparatory Course are counted under accession
limits, and to refine reporting requirements related to Category IV
enlistments and course outcomes.

Sec. 584—Recruiter access to secondary schools
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 503(c)(1)(A) of title 10, United States Code, to require sec-
ondary schools to facilitate not fewer than four in-person recruit-
ment events per academic year, across different grading periods.
This provision would also require secondary schools to provide di-
rectory information to military recruiters within 60 days of the
commencement of the academic year and thereafter within 30 days
of a recruiter request.
Sec. 585—Compliance with travel charge card deactivation
requirements
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to ensure that Department of Defense policies
and procedures are consistent with section 3(h)(1)(H) of the Gov-
ernment Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 (Public Law
112–194).
Items of Special Interest
Adverse childhood experience response teams
The committee recognizes that adverse childhood experiences can
cause long-term impacts on affected individuals and that the De-
partment of Defense has a critical interest in protecting and caring
for the children of members of the Armed Forces.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, a report
assessing the feasibility and advisability of establishing an adverse
childhood experience response team program at the Department of
Defense to address adverse experiences associated with exposure to
trauma among children of members of the Armed Forces, to in-
clude:
(1) Establishing protocols to follow when encountering a
child of a member of the Armed Forces who has been exposed
to trauma to facilitate access to services;
(2) Developing referral partnership agreements with behav-
ioral health providers, substance treatment facilities, and re-
covery services for family members of children of members of
the Armed Forces who have been exposed to trauma;
(3) Integrating law enforcement, mental health, and crisis
services to respond to situations where such children have
been exposed to trauma;
(4) Implementing comprehensive programs and practices to
support such children;
(5) Identifying barriers for such children to access trauma-in-
formed care in their communities;
(6) Providing training in trauma-informed care to emergency
response providers, victim service providers, child protective
service professionals, educational institutions, and other com-
munity partners;
(7) Supporting cross-system planning and collaboration
among officers and employees who work in law enforcement,
court systems, child welfare services, correctional reentry pro-

grams, emergency medical services, health care services, public
health, and substance abuse treatment and recovery support;
(8) Providing technical assistance to communities, organiza-
tions, and public agencies on how to prevent and mitigate the
impact of exposure to trauma and violence;
(9) Integrating an adverse childhood experience response
team program into existing programs of the Department of De-
fense and assessing the impact on existing programs; and
(10) Providing a cost estimate for establishing such a pro-
gram and a timeline for implementation across the Depart-
ment.
Briefing on after-hours childcare options
The committee recognizes the ongoing challenges military fami-
lies face in securing high-quality childcare options, particularly
during non-traditional hours. Despite efforts to overcome the chal-
lenges, current initiatives to expand after-hours childcare are
struggling to meet the needs of servicemembers, especially those
stationed at remote or high-demand locations like Creech Air Force
Base.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Personnel and Readiness, in consultation with the Secre-
taries of the military departments, to brief the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 1, 2026, on Department of Defense efforts to
create and implement incentive programs that would encourage
Family Child Care (FCC) providers—typically military spouses—to
expand their services and provide additional childcare options for
military families. These programs should be designed to alleviate
the burden on servicemembers and their families by increasing the
availability of childcare during after-hours times and non-tradi-
tional times. The briefing should also include: (1) The feasibility
and advisability of increasing compensation or other benefits for
FCC providers to incentivize after-hours care; (2) An assessment of
existing barriers to expanding FCC providers, including resource
requirements; and (3) Recommendations for overcoming those bar-
riers, with special concern for remote installations or off-hours mis-
sion requirements.
Briefing on childcare exceptions to policy
The committee understands that servicemembers and their fami-
lies can experience extenuating circumstances or challenges that
may require a waiver from an installation commander for a de-
pendent to attend a Child Development Center (CDC) outside of
the normal priority system. Ideally, waivers to the priority list are
intended to be used rarely, for severe extenuating circumstances.
However, the lack of clear guidelines creates a risk of these excep-
tions being misused. The committee is not aware of any established
criteria for exceptions to policy, and the process or criteria for at-
taining an exception is not publicized.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 1, 2026, on: (1) The number of authorized exceptions

to the priority system for CDCs for the last two calendar years, de-
lineated by unique mission-related requirements or for standard
operations; (2) Any guidance provided to the components or instal-
lation commanders about when to grant exceptions to policy; (3)
Any guidance provided to servicemembers regarding the ability to
ask for an exception to policy; (4) Any guidance provided to CDC
Directors and Resource and Referral specialists regarding the exe-
cution of exceptions to policy; and (5) Any other matters relating
to exceptions to policy for CDC priority lists that the Secretaries
of the military departments deem necessary.
Briefing on general and flag officer reductions
Pursuant to the memorandum entitled ‘‘General/Flag Officer Re-
ductions,’’ dated May 5, 2025, the Secretary of Defense directed a
force-wide reduction in general and flag officers. In order to con-
duct congressional oversight on this matter, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than February 2, 2026.
This briefing should include, at a minimum: (1) Each military de-
partment’s methodology for identifying general and flag officer re-
ductions; (2) Expected force reduction outcomes by service; (3) De-
tailed implementation plans and timelines for each service; and (4)
An analysis of potential consolidation or grade reduction of the gen-
eral and flag officer positions assigned to joint duty assignments,
as well as all other general and flag officer positions currently ex-
empted from authorized strength by statute.
The Secretaries of the military departments and the Chief of the
National Guard Bureau should support the development of this
briefing and provide the necessary service-specific data and imple-
mentation plans to the Secretary of Defense in a timely manner.
Briefing on military recruits who participated in Junior Re-
serve Officers’ Training Corps
The committee notes that section 512 of the William M. (Mac)
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2021 (Public Law 116–283) expanded the purpose of Junior Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) programs to include ‘‘an introduc-
tion to service opportunities in military, national, and public serv-
ice.’’ This provision was based on a recommendation from the con-
gressionally chartered National Commission on Military, National,
and Public Service.
While not designed to be a military recruiting program, JROTC
has proven to be a valuable way to expose young Americans to the
virtues and benefits of military service. Yet, despite a general
awareness of the link between JROTC participation and military
recruiting, the Department of Defense has been reluctant to sys-
tematically track whether new military recruits have participated
in JROTC. This limits the ability of leaders in the Department and
in the Congress to gain valuable insights that may make JROTC
more effective.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than May 1, 2027, that

includes: (1) The number and percentage of military recruits in fis-
cal year 2026 who participated in the JROTC program; (2) An as-
sessment of the quality of recruits who participated in JROTC com-
pared to those who did not; and (3) An assessment of basic training
attrition rates of recruits who participated in JROTC compared to
those who did not.
Briefing on section 555 of Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2025
The committee notes that section 555 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) amended section
2154 of title 10, United States Code, to require the military serv-
ices to establish a pathway for members of the reserve component
to complete any distance education program offered to satisfy
Phase I or Phase II of joint professional military education (JPME),
as established under such section, in a virtual setting and without
having to attend in-person sessions.
The committee acknowledges and values in-person educational
settings, including for members of the reserve component enrolled
in JPME courses. However, the committee is aware of the many de-
mands placed on members of the reserve component who must bal-
ance their participation in rigorous JPME programs with the obli-
gations of their reserve component military duties, civilian occupa-
tions, and personal lives.
The committee notes that in many cases members of the reserve
component with the greatest civilian responsibilities are also lead-
ers who provide essential capabilities to the U.S. military during
times of armed conflict. Given limited resources and educational
technology that can offer incredible learning experiences in a re-
mote, asynchronous setting, inflexible JPME instructional modali-
ties should not become a barrier to advancement for high-per-
forming and high-potential military officers.
The committee believes that the military services must do more
to ensure that the many demands they place on members of the re-
serve component are prioritized and optimized to best fit the most
critical needs of the services. Section 555 was passed into law in
the spirit of that belief. However, the Army War College’s imple-
mentation of Section 555 has resulted in an inflexible virtual pro-
gram that requires real-time participation during the work day
throughout a two-week session when other students are present in
class, and only if approved by a general officer. This option offers
no real flexibility to members of the reserve component and results
in additional unnecessary bureaucratic barriers.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than January 31, 2026, on the
Army’s plan to fully implement section 555 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159). Such briefing shall
include the Army War College’s communications plan for ensuring
its students are aware of the statutory option to complete JPME
in a virtual setting, any policies or procedures associated with im-

plementing this provision, and any recommendations for policy
changes related to this law.
Careers in mapping and surveying
The committee recognizes the important role that mappers and
surveyors perform in American society. The committee encourages
the military departments to provide to members of the Armed
Forces who are enrolled in the Transition Assistance Program in-
formation and resources about follow-on civilian career opportuni-
ties with occupational specialties related to surveying and map-
ping. Furthermore, for such members seeking opportunities in the
Department of Defense’s SkillBridge program, the committee en-
courages the military departments to facilitate SkillBridge intern-
ship programs in mapping and surveying fields.
Cell phone-free Department of Defense Education Activity
schools
The committee acknowledges that the Joint Explanatory State-
ment to Accompany the Servicemember Quality of Life Improve-
ment and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025
(Public Law 118–159) contained a requirement for the Secretary of
Defense to provide the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives a briefing, not later than
July 1, 2025, on the use of cell phones within the academic envi-
ronment at Department of Defense Education Activity schools, in-
cluding an assessment of such use on student achievement. Civil-
ian school districts are increasingly trending toward prohibiting
cell phone use during school hours to limit student distractions,
with much success. The committee encourages the Secretary to
complete the required briefing by the required due date.
Clarity in communications for Exceptional Family Member
Program legal assistance
The committee understands that certain dependents of
servicemembers enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Pro-
gram experience challenges receiving proper special needs edu-
cational assistance when moving from one school to another. Sec-
tion 582 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) required
the military services to provide special education attorneys or legal
assistance to military families. The committee is aware that, while
the military services have implemented section 582, there is still
confusion at joint military installations about whether a service-
member in one service can receive legal assistance from another
military service.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than April 1, 2026,
on: (1) How each service manages special education legal assistance
at joint installations; (2) The level of support authorized by legal
assistance attorneys for special education matters; (3) Any barriers
to providing special education legal assistance to military depend-
ents at Department of Defense Education Activity schools; and (4)

Any relevant feedback or insight into the efficacy of the special

Comptroller General review of military service academy
curricula and staffing practices
The committee recognizes the importance of the U.S. Military
Academy, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy (here-
after referred to collectively as military service academies) in devel-
oping future military leaders. The military service academies pro-
vide a tuition-free, 4-year undergraduate education designed to
educate and graduate students with the knowledge and character
needed to lead as officers in the U.S. Armed Forces. While enrolled
at the military service academies, students are Active-Duty cadets
or midshipmen who live in military barracks, wear uniforms, and,
in addition to the academic curricula, participate in military train-
ing and professional development. The military service academies
employ a mixture of military and civilian faculty and staff to edu-
cate and train students in the required academic and practical
skills.
The committee is interested in how the military service acad-
emies ensure curricula and staffing practices remain current and
relevant to the dynamic environment into which their graduating
students will be entering.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to review the extent to which the military service
academies adapt their curricula and staffing strategies to meet
their respective missions. The review should provide a description
of current curricula at each military service academy and identify
trends in staffing, including the mix of military and civilians,
tenured faculty, and individuals with specializations or subject
matter expertise to provide needed curricula. The review should
also assess the extent to which the military service academies
have: (1) Implemented plans or processes for reviewing curricula to
ensure alignment with the strategic needs of the military; (2) Im-
plemented plans or processes to identify and address staffing
needs, including the determination of billet type and subject matter
expertise needed to support the administration of the curricula and
other strategic needs; (3) Modified their curricula and staffing to
adapt to changes to the strategic environment or in response to re-
cent related Executive Orders or other relevant guidance, as appro-
priate; and (4) Any additional issues that the Comptroller General
deems relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to brief
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than April 15, 2026, with the results of
the review to follow in a mutually agreed upon format and time-
frame.

of the family. In the committee report accompanying S. 4638 (S.
Rep. 118–188), the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2025, the committee directed the service secretaries to provide
a briefing on service reassignment policies under circumstances re-
lating to compassionate, humanitarian, or safety concerns of a serv-
icemember or military family.
The briefings provided by the services raise further questions
about the circumstances under which reassignment would be ap-
proved for personal hardship and under other circumstances of in-
justice or severe iniquity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a review of the military service compas-
sionate reassignment policies as described in the service responses
to S. Rep. 118–188 and to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than December 1, 2025, with a report to follow at an
agreed upon date.
Crew complement of F–15E and F–15EX programs
The committee recognizes the critical role that F–15E Weapon
System Officers (WSOs) have played in recent operations, including
their significant contributions to the successful downing of more
than 80 Iranian attack drones in April 2024. While the operational
environment was relatively permissive, the WSO’s ability to man-
age sensors, coordinate fires, and communicate with external agen-
cies was instrumental to mission success.
As the Air Force proceeds with the phased divestment of certain
F–15E aircraft and the procurement of the F–15EX platform, the
committee notes a lack of detail regarding how the Air Force in-
tends to retain and leverage its investment in the F–15E WSO
workforce. Furthermore, the committee is interested in under-
standing the range of options being considered for the employment
of officers operating in the F–15EX rear cockpit.
The committee is concerned that the Air Force has yet to clearly
define the primary mission profile for the F–15EX, whether it is in-
tended to be primarily an air-to-air or an air-to-ground platform.
This lack of strategic clarity complicates planning for crew require-
ments, training pipelines, and capability development. A firm deci-
sion is particularly critical given the F–15EX’s potential to support
advanced missions such as facilitating long-range kill chains, con-
ducting non-traditional command and control, contributing to elec-
tronic warfare missions, and conducting air-to-surface strike mis-
sions that may be more effectively executed with two crew mem-
bers.
The committee notes that potential tasks for an operator in the
rear cockpit of the F–15EX could include a wide range of mission-
enhancing functions such as operating advanced sensors, con-
ducting electronic warfare tasks, managing multi-domain command
and control responsibilities, and coordinating complex tactical sce-
narios in real time. These functions could increase overall mission
effectiveness of U.S. forces in contested and dynamic operational

directs the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a report to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026. This
report should include: (1) An assessment of how any planned F–
15E divestitures may affect overall WSO career field manning re-
quirements; (2) The Air Force’s strategy for managing WSOs with
remaining service obligations in the context of F–15E divestiture;
(3) A description of current and potential future operational con-
cepts for the F–15EX, including how and when the rear cockpit
may be utilized across various mission profiles, including command
and control functions; (4) The extent to which rear-cockpit occu-
pants are necessary in F–15EX operations; (5) Any plans under
consideration to ensure sufficient personnel are available to sup-
port F–15EX operations that may require or benefit from a two-
crew configuration; and (6) A timeline for making a determination
on the F–15EX’s primary mission role and how that decision will
shape crew requirements and capabilities development.
Enhance Department of Defense science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics education and career-con-
nected pathways
The committee is encouraged by continued Department of De-
fense efforts to support the science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) ecosystem, including efforts under the De-
fense STEM Education Consortium and similar activities. These ac-
tivities support K–12, higher education, and workforce development
programs necessary to build a 21st century workforce with the
skills and talents to meet evolving defense challenges. The com-
mittee encourages the Department to ensure its activities include
career-connected learning, as well as research and evaluation ef-
forts, necessary to scale and adopt practices that can support mili-
tary-connected families.
Enhanced career counseling in Transition Assistance Pro-
gram
The committee acknowledges the critical role of the Transition
Assistance Program (TAP) in preparing servicemembers for transi-
tion to civilian life well in advance of their separation from service.
The committee also recognizes that the timelines prescribed by sec-
tion 1142 of title 10, United States Code, may conflict with the re-
tention efforts of the military services. The committee believes
servicemembers should be fully informed of all their career options,
including remaining in the active component, transitioning to the
reserves, or staying in the reserve component, as well as the com-
prehensive benefits of continued service.
The committee encourages the Department of Defense to inte-
grate retention specialists into the TAP curriculum to ensure
servicemembers are aware of their full range of options, including
continued active duty or reserve service, as well as the long-term
career and financial advantages of staying in uniform, alongside ci-
vilian employment opportunities. By adding retention specialists to
the pre-separation counseling brief and standardized TAP cur-
riculum, servicemembers will be better equipped to make informed
decisions, ultimately supporting both their career goals and overall
force readiness.

Ensuring statutory compliance in accession classification
and reporting
The committee is concerned about the Department of Defense’s
(DOD) current interpretation and implementation of section 520 of
title 10, United States Code, as it relates to the classification and
reporting of accession quality. Specifically, the Army’s practice of
reclassifying trainees who originally scored at or above the tenth
percentile and below the thirty-first percentile on the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT)—based on improved scores achieved dur-
ing the Future Soldier Preparatory Course—was made possible by
exceptions to policy granted by the Under Secretary of Defense for
Personnel and Readiness.
The committee notes that these exceptions contradict section 520
of title 10, United States Code, which requires that the AFQT score
used to determine compliance with statutory limitations must be
the score at the time of original enlistment—not a retest score.
This reinterpretation undermines transparency and congressional
oversight and should be discontinued. The committee understands
the value of the Future Servicemember Preparatory Course and ac-
knowledges that increases in AFQT should be reflected in a mili-
tary recruit’s profile and career options. Likewise, these higher
scores should be reflected in overall reporting and tracking of ac-
cessions data. However, the current practice is not consistent with
the law.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense and
the Secretaries of the military departments to track and report
both the original AFQT scores and the improved AFQT scores for
any recruits who attend the Future Servicemember Preparatory
Course for purposes of academic improvement. As of now, all acces-
sions data and analysis must include the AFQT score at the time
of original enlistment, in accordance with the law.
The committee strongly supports the services’ efforts to improve
recruit quality and expand opportunities for individuals who may
benefit from additional training. Nothing in this requirement pro-
hibits the continued use of preparatory courses or similar pro-
grams. In fact, the committee encourages the services to build on
the early successes of these initiatives. However, reporting and
classification must align with statutory definitions—specifically,
using the AFQT score recorded at the time of original enlistment,
in accordance with section 520 of title 10, United States Code.
Additionally, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Personnel and Readiness to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, not later than October 1, 2025. The briefing must in-
clude: (1) An updated response to the recommendations provided by
the DOD Inspector General’s May 1, 2025, report titled ‘‘Review of
the Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course’’; (2) Accurate acces-
sion quality data for each military service since the inception of the
Future Soldier Preparatory Course and the Future Sailor Pre-
paratory Course, based on AFQT scores at the time of enlistment;
(3) A plan to ensure full compliance with section 520 of title 10,
United States Code; (4) Any legislative or policy proposals that
would improve the Department’s ability to report accessions data
to reflect improvements in pre-basic training candidates who at-

ability to improve the overall transparency and integrity of acces-
sions reporting; and (5) Any other information that the Under Sec-
retary deems necessary and relevant.
Filling short-term servicemember childcare needs with
Kinderspot
The committee is aware that the Air Force has utilized a mobile
application called Kinderspot to help servicemembers find short-
term childcare needs on an installation. Kinderspot allows parents
to sublet their childcare spaces at Air Force Child Development
Centers (CDCs) when they do not need the spaces, connecting them
with other eligible servicemembers who may need short-term
childcare. Short-term childcare can often be a challenge for
servicemembers and their families. The committee commends the
Air Force for using Kinderspot, a Small Business Innovation Re-
search awardee, to provide military families additional flexible
childcare options. The other military services may benefit from a
similar capability. Therefore the committee directs the Secretaries
of the military departments to provide the Senate Armed Services
Committee a briefing, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1) The ex-
isting capabilities of each military service to allow for short-term
sublets of CDC spots; (2) Any resources necessary to create or uti-
lize a capability to allow short-term sublets of CDC spots; (3) Any
additional short-term childcare options the military services are
providing to servicemembers and their families; and (4) Any other
matters a Secretary determines to be relevant.
Implementation report on self-initiated mental health refer-
rals
The committee acknowledges and commends the Department of
Defense for its efforts to implement a self-initiated referral process
for mental health evaluations, as required by section 1090b(e) of
title 10, United States Code, across the active duty force and recog-
nizes the steps taken to expand access to mental health care. These
efforts reflect a growing commitment to reducing stigma and in-
creasing support for servicemembers in crisis.
However, the committee is concerned by reports of inconsistent
application of, and education and training on, this self-initiated re-
ferral process across active-duty units and applicable Reserve Com-
ponent troops on active-duty orders. The committee notes that, al-
though the military departments and services have made progress
in executing the law, more work is required to fully implement the
law, educate servicemembers on the policy, and ensure trans-
parency and accountability for those responsible for enforcing the
law.
Additionally, the committee is concerned that Phase II of the im-
plementation plan, to implement within the Reserve Component, to
include the Reserves and the National Guard, serving less than 30
consecutive days on active orders, has not yet occurred.
Therefore the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Personnel and Readiness, in coordination with the Secretaries
of the military departments and the Director of the Defense Health
Agency, to submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-

ate and the House of Representatives, not later than December 31,
2025, a briefing on the implementation of the self-initiated referral
process required under section 1090b(e) of title 10, United States
Code. The report should include:
(1) Any Department of Defense instruction or other docu-
ment issued by the Secretary of Defense since May 5, 2023,
with respect to the implementation of the self-initiated referral
process required under 1090b(e) of title 10, United States
Code;
(2) Any memorandum or guidance issued by:
(a) the Department of the Navy since July 11, 2023 di-
recting the implementation of such process;
(b) the Department of the Air Force since July 28, 2023,
directing the implementation of such process; and
(c) the Department of the Army since August 29, 2023,
directing the implementation of such process;
(3) A description and timeline of any communications made
to members of the Armed Forces with respect to the implemen-
tation of such process;
(4) A description and timeline of efforts by the Secretary of
each military department to implement the annual training re-
quired under subsection (f) of such section; and
(5) A description and timeline of efforts to ensure that such
process reduces stigma in accordance with subsection (b) of
such section.
In addition, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Personnel and Readiness and each military department to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives biannually on implementation progress,
training effectiveness, and report adherence to section 1090b(e) of
title 10, United States Code. This biannual reporting requirement
should terminate on December 31, 2030.
Importance of independent legal advice by military judge
advocates
The committee notes that the ability to provide independent legal
advice is a fundamental principle in the military legal system and
is integral to the core values of military judge advocates. The com-
mittee further notes that judge advocates are military officers who
take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United
States. The committee believes that this oath cannot be upheld by
simply telling superior officers what they want to hear or by offer-
ing advice based on personal beliefs. Finally, the committee notes
that judge advocates are ethically required to provide candid advice
based on their independent legal judgement.
Accordingly, the committee affirms the value of the independent
legal advice of judge advocates.
Integration of military service outcome data with state edu-
cational systems
The committee recognizes the importance of understanding the
postsecondary outcomes of students who pursue military service
and the role this information can play in both enhancing military
readiness and informing educational policy and practice.

Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
consultation with the Secretary of Education and relevant stake-
holders, to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than May
1, 2026, on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a data
sharing system related to individual servicemember outcomes into
state educational agencies’ longitudinal data systems to enhance
military readiness and student success. Data elements to consider
should include, but should not be limited to, enlistment dates, mili-
tary occupational specialties, initial military rank, Armed Forces
Qualification Test scores, separation dates, and completion of ini-
tial training or credentialing programs. Such a briefing should in-
clude an assessment of any data or personal privacy concerns im-
plicated by such a data sharing system, the projected costs and re-
source requirements to establish such a system, and an assessment
of how such a system would enhance military recruiting efforts.
Navy Personnel Command Records Analysis Branch process
briefing
The committee is concerned about the lengthy response times
and challenges receiving accurate information when inquiries to
the Navy Personnel Command’s Records Analysis Branch are sub-
mitted by Members of Congress on behalf of their constituents.
There have been significant challenges to receiving accurate up-
dates on constituent cases and receiving adjudications in a timely
manner. In certain circumstances, it appears that records may be
misplaced during the process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a briefing, not later than July 1, 2026, to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
describing the existing process within Navy Personnel Command’s
Records Analysis Branch designed to expedite congressional inquir-
ies and cases to and from the Board for Correction of Naval
Records. The briefing should also include: (1) Data on the Navy
Personnel Command’s Records Analysis Branch response times
over the previous 5 years; (2) The average time to close cases, in-
cluding those initiated through congressional inquiries, as well as
the average time to issue final determinations on all cases; and (3)
The response times for cases that require records after receipt of
the record from the National Personnel Records Center, specifically
highlighting the length of time to receive records.
Oversight of suicide prevention policy and access to mental
health care
The committee remains concerned about the persistent rates of
suicide among servicemembers and believes suicide prevention
must remain a top priority for the Department of Defense and the
military services. While the Department has made notable invest-
ments in prevention, response, and resiliency efforts, the committee
continues to have concerns regarding consistency and coordination
of policies across the services.
The committee emphasizes the importance of sustaining momen-
tum in suicide prevention by ensuring that servicemembers are
fully aware of, and empowered to utilize, available mental health

resources. The committee is particularly concerned about perceived
or actual barriers to self-referral for mental health care and en-
courages the Department to evaluate policies, procedures, and unit-
level cultures that may discourage servicemembers to seek needed
care.
The committee supports the Department’s continued efforts to
improve the quality, accessibility, and visibility of suicide preven-
tion resources. However, the success of these initiatives depends on
clear leadership, accountability, transparent data sharing, and a
servicemember’s ability to access care without stigma or delay. The
committee expects the Department to maintain robust oversight
and ensure timely implementation of suicide prevention rec-
ommendations, particularly those of the Suicide Prevention and Re-
sponse Independent Review Committee.
Potential school choice options for Department of Defense
Education Activity
The committee notes that the January 29, 2025, Executive Order
Number 14191 ‘‘Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity
for Families,’’ required the Secretary of Defense to review available
mechanisms under which military-connected families may use
funds from the Department of Defense to attend schools of their
choice, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools. The
Executive Order further directed the Secretary to submit a plan to
the President describing such mechanisms and the steps that
would be necessary to implement them beginning in the 2025–2026
school year.
Accordingly, not later than 30 days after the publication of this
report, the committee directs the Secretary to provide to the con-
gressional defense committees a whole and identical copy of the
plan that the Secretary submitted to the President.
Preservation of the Force and Family program
The committee strongly supports U.S. Special Operations Com-
mand’s (SOCOM) Preservation of the Force and Families (POTFF)
program and recognizes its vital role in sustaining the readiness of
special operations forces by building resilience and optimizing per-
formance. The committee notes that SOCOM utilizes its Human
Performance Data Management System to improve its data collec-
tion, governance, and management. In an effort to ensure SOCOM
provides clear guidance on achieving an integrated and holistic
care system for POTFF, the committee encourages SOCOM to con-
tinue these efforts and seek opportunities to enhance its use of
data to optimize support through the POTFF program.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the
Commander, SOCOM, to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than October 1, 2025, detailing ongoing efforts to fully uti-
lize the Human Performance Data Management System.

among young Americans. Accordingly, the committee directs the
Secretary of Defense to assess the feasibility and advisability of
recognizing high schools with military enlistment rates above their
state average. As part of this assessment, the Secretary should
evaluate potential criteria for recognition, the likely impact of such
a designation on enlistment rates and school culture, and options
for implementation, including, but not limited to, issuing a formal
letter of recognition from the Secretary to each qualifying school.
The committee further directs the Secretary to submit a report to
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than April 1, 2026, outlining proposed
criteria for recognition, the anticipated impact of recognizing mili-
tary-friendly schools, and recommendations for implementation or
expansion.
Report on human performance technologies
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a re-
port to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than July 1, 2026, on opportu-
nities to improve collaboration across the military departments in
the development, integration, and coordination of human perform-
ance technologies that support warfighter readiness.
The report should focus specifically on technological tools and
systems—such as wearable devices, performance tracking software,
cognitive enhancement tools, and other physical or digital tech-
nologies—designed to improve physical, cognitive, nutritional, psy-
chological, and sleep readiness.
The report should include: (1) Opportunities to align require-
ments development, resource sharing, and best practices for human
performance technologies across the military departments; (2)
Mechanisms to improve coordination of service-specific human per-
formance efforts, including data interoperability, shared research
priorities, and program evaluation standards; (3) An assessment of
the utility of existing or potential collaborative structures—such as
cross-service working groups or cross-functional teams—to support
enterprise-level integration of human performance technologies
without establishing a centralized governing authority; and (4) An
assessment on how data collected through such technologies is pro-
tected against misuse, including the sale or unauthorized transfer
of sensitive servicemember information to third-party data brokers,
as highlighted in recent research on risks to military personnel pri-
vacy.
For the purposes of this report, ‘‘human performance tech-
nologies’’ refers to tools and systems that enhance performance in
domains such as physical fitness, cognitive function, mental resil-
ience, sleep health, and nutrition, as described in the Army’s Octo-
ber 1, 2020, Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) Operating Concept.

quires the Secretary of Defense to establish a process under which
each member of the Armed Forces, before the member retires or is
otherwise separated from the Armed Forces, is: (1) Informed in
writing of the prohibition, and the penalties for violations of the
prohibition; and (2) Required to certify that the member under-
stands the prohibition and those penalties.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit a briefing, not later than January 12, 2026, to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on the efforts of the Department of Defense (DOD) to imple-
ment the requirement to inform members of the Armed Forces with
respect to this prohibition. The briefing should include information
on the following: (1) The manner in which the DOD has imple-
mented a process for providing the required notification to each
member of the Armed Forces; (2) Any assessment the Department
has made on its ability to provide adequate notification in writing
with respect to the prohibition and the penalties for violations of
the prohibition; (3) The progress the Department has made in ob-
taining the certification required from each member of the Armed
Forces before the member retires or otherwise separates from the
Armed Forces; and (4) Any recommended changes to policies, proce-
dures, or resources to improve the ability of the Department to pro-
vide adequate notification with respect to the prohibition.
Report on public service loan forgiveness
In section 559B of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improve-
ment and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025
(Public Law 118–159), the Congress directed the Department of De-
fense and Department of Education to, within 1 year, implement
a data match enabling servicemembers to automatically receive
credit for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to publish on a publicly available
website of the Department of Defense a report on the efforts of the
Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Education to implement
section 559B. The report shall include, but not be limited to, infor-
mation on: (1) How many servicemembers, disaggregated by active-
duty servicemembers and civilians, had received PSLF before im-
plementation of the data match; (2) How many servicemembers to
date have received PSLF through the data match; and (3) Whether
the data match has been completed and, if not, the agencies’ efforts
to complete the data match to date. The report shall be submitted
by March 1, 2026, and shall be submitted quarterly until the data
match has been completed.
Report on training records for post-9/11 servicemembers
The committee remains concerned about the transition of
servicemembers from military service to civilian life. In section 574
of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–
159), the Congress required the Secretaries of the military depart-
ments to provide training and competency records that reflect a
plain-language description of the training, courses, certifications,
and qualifications of separating servicemembers to facilitate such
servicemembers’ prospects of finding well-matched civilian employ-

ment. The committee is aware that many veterans who have al-
ready separated from service would also benefit from such records.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Personnel and Readiness to provide a report to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than May 1, 2026, on the feasibility and advisability of
providing training and competency records to members of the
Armed Forces who served on or after September 11, 2001.
Service casualty assistance office resourcing and capacity
The committee is aware that the military service casualty assist-
ance offices have many significant and sensitive responsibilities,
one of which is to support the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agen-
cy (DPAA) with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Family Reference
Sample (FRS) collection. Through their respective Secretary of a
military department, service casualty assistance offices are respon-
sible for conducting genealogy searches to determine the primary
next of kin of missing servicemembers and appropriate DNA FRS
donors and to collect family artifacts and other material as re-
quired for DNA analysis. Once collected, the DPAA and the Armed
Forces Medical Examiner System’s Armed Forces DNA Identifica-
tion Laboratory compares the FRS against DNA extracted from re-
covered remains to identify missing servicemembers. The com-
mittee understands that some of the military services are under-
resourced for this important purpose, which then limits the work
that the DPAA can do to identify recovered remains in their care.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, on: (1) The existing resources for each military services’ cas-
ualty assistance office for the functions they are required to per-
form, with a specific delineation for the genealogy work and FRS
collection to support the DPAA; (2) An assessment from the mili-
tary services regarding the additional resources required to remove
any limitation on genealogy caseload to expand efforts to support
DPAA; (3) Any additional resources or authorities that would assist
the military service casualty assistance offices with their existing
responsibilities; and (4) Any other matters the Secretaries deter-
mine relevant.
Study on the readiness and transition impacts of the
SkillBridge program
The committee recognizes the need for greater support to our
servicemembers as they transition out of the U.S. military. The
SkillBridge program is a valuable opportunity for servicemembers
to gain civilian work experience through specific industry training,
apprenticeships, or internships during the last days of service to
better prepare them for life outside of service. The committee also
understands that use of this program depends on commanders’ as-
sessment of unit readiness and their acceptance of risk to allow for
participation.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a one-time report to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,

2026, on the effectiveness of the SkillBridge program by providing
empirical data and analysis. This report will include:
(1) The total amount of individuals who apply and enroll in
the SkillBridge program (broken out by rank, specialty, and
length of time);
(2) The application and participation rates across different
military branches and what branch-specific policies or cultural
factors contribute to the differences;
(3) The specialties and ranks that benefit the most and least
from SkillBridge participation;
(4) The total amount of individuals who have been denied
participation based on readiness concerns (both before and
after branch-specific restriction policy enactment);
(5) How mission readiness has been affected by participa-
tion;
(6) How the program has affected transition outcomes meas-
ured by hiring rates from SkillBridge companies and, of those,
how many are employed by their SkillBridge program company
or in similar fields;
(7) A list of the companies and industries that participate;
(8) The number and percentage of participants who gain em-
ployment after completion of the program;
(9) A list of the barriers that are preventing commanders
from making accurate readiness risk assessments for their
units under the current SkillBridge program; and
(10) Steps to be taken to ensure the services properly bal-
ance the best possible transition outcomes for all
servicemembers and readiness.
Summer camp programs for military-connected youth
The committee recognizes the challenges faced by children of
servicemembers, including the disruptions caused by frequent relo-
cations and extended deployments. These factors can impact chil-
dren’s emotional and psychological well-being, affecting family sta-
bility and military readiness. To mitigate these challenges, the
committee encourages the Department of Defense to explore ways
in which it can support summer camp programs designed specifi-
cally for military-connected youth.
These camps provide a structured, supportive environment in
which children can develop resilience, build peer networks, and ac-
quire life and leadership skills. Furthermore, summer camps foster
a sense of identity and connection to military life among children
of servicemembers, which increases their propensity to serve in the
military themselves. A significant portion of future military per-
sonnel come from military families, and these programs play a cru-
cial role in inspiring the next generation to serve. The committee
urges the Department to prioritize programs that integrate mental
health support; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
education; and leadership development for all eligible families.

TITLE VI—COMPENSATION AND OTHER
PERSONNEL BENEFITS
Subtitle A—Pay and Allowances
Sec. 601—Modifications to calculation of basic allowance for
subsistence for enlisted members
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 402 of title 37, United States Code, to simplify the calculation
of basic allowance for subsistence and ensure the allowance shall
not decrease from year to year. Additionally, the provision would
update the calculation and amount payable of basic allowance for
subsistence in the case of a member subject to monthly deductions
from pay for meals provided by essential station messing.
Sec. 602—Inclusion of descriptions of types of pay on pay
statements
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to ensure that pay statements for
servicemembers include clear, plain-language descriptions for each
type of pay, allowance, and deduction. Additionally, the provision
would require that the descriptions must cover the legal authority,
purpose, eligibility criteria, and potential changes to each item.
They must be easily accessible on the pay statement and written
in language that is understandable to those without specialized
knowledge of military finance. This requirement would take effect
180 days after the bill is enacted.
Sec. 603—Increased awareness and improved calculation of
rates for basic allowance for housing
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to publish a clear, accessible document that
explains how basic allowance for housing rates are determined, in-
cluding methodology and types of data sources used. This informa-
tion would also be provided directly to servicemembers upon any
event that may impact their basic allowance for housing and shall
include an explanation of the type of rental housing their basic al-
lowance for housing is intended to support in each locality.
This provision would require the Secretary of Defense to develop
an alternative methodology for calculating basic allowance for
housing, based on the typical cost of housing units by number of
bedrooms rather than solely on pay grade and dependent status,
incorporating both available and verified occupied rental market
data. Once developed, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct a pilot
program using the new methodology, setting notional rates for the
basic allowance for housing for calendar years 2026 and 2027 for
a minimum of 10 military housing areas.

The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2027, that
includes: (1) A comparison of the notional rates with the actual
rates for basic allowance for housing for 2026 and 2027; (2) A com-
parison of the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology
and the use of setting each such rates; (3) A determination of
whether the alternative methodology is more or less likely than the
current methodology to ensure that rates for basic allowance for
housing are set based upon a 95 percent statistical confidence that
the estimated median rent is within 10 percent of the actual me-
dian rent in local military housing areas; (4) A comparison of cost
estimates for 2027 using both methodologies; (5) An identification
of any additional legislative authority required to fully implement
the new methodology; and (6) The recommendation of the Secretary
with respect to whether to implement the use of the new method-
ology and the timing for such implementation.
Sec. 604—Military compensation educational campaign
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to initiate a 12-month educational campaign,
not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,
to improve knowledge and understanding of pay and benefits by
servicemembers and military families. The campaign would cover
key topics, including: (1) Elements of regular military compensa-
tion as defined in section 101(25) of title 37, United States Code;
(2) Special and incentive pays; (3) Retirement pay calculations; (4)
Educational assistance programs and benefits; (5) Healthcare for
Active-Duty members and their families; and (6) Nonmonetary ben-
efits.
Subtitle B—Special and Incentive Pay
Sec. 611—Reviews of designations of imminent danger pay
areas
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a review of each area designated
by section 351(a)(3) of title 37, United States Code, as imminent
danger pay. This review should validate that each area is one in
which a member is subject to imminent danger of physical injury
due to threat conditions. Not later than 60 days after each review,
a report shall be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, including any
changes to designations resulting from the review. The initial re-
view and report shall be conducted not later than March 1, 2026,
and subsequent reviews and reports shall be conducted not less
than every 5 years thereafter. If, at any time between the submis-
sions of required reviews and reports, the Secretary of Defense or
the Secretary of a military department conducts a review of des-
ignated areas and makes a change to any such designation, that
Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the review
and the change not later than 60 days after the change is made.

Sec. 612—Implementation of aviation incentive pay for
members of reserve components
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 602(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) to require the Secretary of Defense
to assess aviation incentive pay programs across the services for ef-
fectiveness, consistency, and alignment with retention and readi-
ness needs, and to begin payments based on that assessment.
Sec. 613—Pilot program on improving retention of members
with degrees in their fields of specialty
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a pilot program to assess the fea-
sibility and advisability of paying incentive pay to enlisted mem-
bers of the Armed Forces with degrees in their fields of specialty
to improve the retention of such members.
Subtitle C—Other Matters
Sec. 621—Extension of enhanced authority for selective
early retirement and early discharges
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 638a(a)(2) of title 10, United States Code, to extend the en-
hanced authority for selective retirement and early discharges until
December 31, 2030.
Sec. 622—Extension of temporary early retirement authority
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4403(i) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 1993 (Public Law 102–484) to extend temporary early retire-
ment authority until December 31, 2030.
Sec. 623—Extension of authority to provide voluntary sepa-
ration pay and benefits
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1175a(k)(1) of title 10, United States Code, to extend the au-
thority to provide voluntary separation pay and benefits in accord-
ance with this section until December 31, 2030.
Sec. 624—Designation of United States Army Garrison Kwaj-
alein Atoll as remote and isolated military installation
The committee recommends a provision that would designate
United States Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll as a remote and iso-
lated installation as set forth in Department of Defense Instruc-
tions 1015.10 and 1015.18, dated July 6, 2009, and May 30, 2024,
respectively.
Sec. 625—Designation of Creech Air Force Base as a remote

Sec. 626—Provision of counseling on housing for members of
the Armed Forces
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 992 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the military
departments to enter into contracts to provide counseling to
servicemembers on mortgages and other financial products related
to the lease or purchase of residences.
Sec. 627—Program to provide Government-funded transpor-
tation for certain members of the Armed Forces sta-
tioned overseas
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a Government-funded transpor-
tation program for unaccompanied servicemembers traveling from
designated overseas locations to their home of record. The com-
mittee strongly encourages the Secretary of Defense to prioritize lo-
cations that are geographically isolated, have harsh climates, or
lack adequate family and community support, such as Alaska and
Guam.
Sec. 628—Prohibition on procurement and commissary sales
of seafood originating or processed in the People’s Re-
public of China
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Department of Defense from procuring seafood originating or proc-
essed in the People’s Republic of China for use in military dining
facilities and from selling such seafood in commissary stores.
Items of Special Interest
Analysis of outsourcing Defense Commissary Agency func-
tions for enhanced efficiency
The committee recognizes the critical role commissaries play in
supporting military families by providing access to affordable gro-
ceries, particularly in high-cost and geographically remote areas.
The committee seeks to explore opportunities to improve effi-
ciencies within the system without compromising this core benefit.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
seek to enter into a contract with a federally funded research and
development center to conduct a simulation and evaluation of out-
sourcing Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) functions for en-
hanced efficiency.
The simulation should evaluate: (1) Whether a commercial gro-
cery retailer can consistently deliver a 25 percent savings benefit
to commissary patrons across 235 global locations without the use
of congressional appropriations; and (2) Whether DeCA could sus-
tain operations in remote and overseas locations under any pro-
posed model, given that these sites often depend on cross-subsidies
from higher-revenue commissaries to remain viable.
Additionally, the simulation should analyze a representative
sample of commissary sites, considering factors such as: (1) Geo-
graphic diversity; (2) Patron demographics; (3) Existing savings
rates; and (4) The availability of alternative grocery options.

119
Particular attention should be paid to rural and overseas loca-
tions, where the commissary benefit is more essential and where
market conditions may limit the feasibility of commercial replace-
ment.
Further, the simulation should explore various contracting op-
tions to improve efficiency while preserving core benefits, but with-
out a presumption that any model would be better than the current
structure. It must also account for the DeCA’s current business
model, in which revenue generated from larger U.S.-based stores is
used to subsidize operations at rural and overseas commissaries.
To the extent possible, the simulation should incorporate input
from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel
and Readiness, defense resale organizations, and relevant industry
stakeholders. The simulation must require that any future busi-
ness model for operating commissary stores would maintain a min-
imum patron savings rate of no less than 25 percent.
Finally, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide
a report of the simulation to the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than Janu-
ary 1, 2027, addressing the feasibility, metrics, and costs of oper-
ating commissary stores through contracted vendor services. The
report should cover, at a minimum: (1) Methods of selection for lo-
cations to be analyzed for contracted services; (2) Market research
on commercial grocery chains that express interest in participating
in contracted commissary operations; (3) The costs and liabilities
incurred by the Government, including the military services, mili-
tary installations, and the DeCA, that would result from operating
commissary stores through contracted vendors; (4) Potential im-
pacts on military family quality of life, morale, and retention, par-
ticularly in high-cost or geographically isolated locations; (5) An
evaluation of the potential impacts on current DeCA employees; (6)
A risk assessment, as well as proposed contingency measures, to
ensure uninterrupted access to affordable groceries for eligible pa-
trons; and (7) Recommendations for specific administrative or legis-
lative action that the Secretary considers appropriate to modernize
and improve the delivery of the commissary benefit.
Briefing on adequacy of cost of living allowances calcula-
tions
The committee notes that the 14th Quadrennial Review of Mili-
tary Compensation highlighted a concern regarding the current liv-
ing pattern survey, which is used to determine cost of living allow-
ances both in the continental United States and overseas. The re-
port indicates that this survey may lead to discrepancies in allow-
ance rates for areas that are geographically close due to variations
in shopping behaviors. This raises concerns about the survey’s ac-
curacy in reflecting the actual purchasing habits of
servicemembers. Additionally, there may be significant differences
between the commissary usage reported in the survey and actual
sales data from commissaries.
In response to these findings, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to brief the Senate Armed Services Committee,
not later than February 15, 2026. The briefing should assess the
effectiveness of the living pattern survey in determining cost of liv-

ing allowances. This assessment should include an analysis of any
discrepancies between the survey data and annual commissary
usage statistics, as well as recommendations for more accurate
methods of calculating cost of living allowances, particularly
through a better understanding of Department of Defense com-
missary and exchange utilization.
Briefing on separation and retirement policies of certain
members of the Armed Forces
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a brief-
ing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, by not later than February 1, 2026, as-
sessing the Department of Defense’s implementation of the Sec-
retary’s February 7, 2025, memorandum entitled ‘‘Prioritizing Mili-
tary Excellence and Readiness’’ and the May 8, 2025, Secretary of
Defense memorandum entitled ‘‘Implementing Policy on
Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness.’’ The briefing
should include: (1) The processes for determining affected
servicemembers; (2) The number and grades of affected
servicemembers; (3) The number of requests for an exception to
policy with respect to retirement or separation; (4) The number of
requests so granted or denied; and (5) The overall impact of imple-
mentation on the readiness of the Armed Forces.
Commending the United Service Organizations
The committee recognizes the invaluable role the United Service
Organizations (USO) has played in supporting American
servicemembers for over 80 years, particularly in the face of rapidly
evolving global security challenges. In the wake of the Israel-
Hamas conflict in October 2023, the committee understands that
the USO adjusted its operations to meet the increased demands for
support across the Middle East. Due to the threat level in the re-
gion, many deployed servicemembers did not have access to their
normal recreation activities. In response, the USO significantly ex-
panded its own in-person and virtual offerings to ensure that those
serving in the region were supported with the necessary resources
to maintain morale and connection to their families.
The committee understands that the USO has also broadened its
outreach to other critical regions, including the Indo-Pacific, east-
ern Europe, Africa, and aboard Navy ships deployed worldwide.
Notably, the USO measured an 11 percent increase in visits to its
centers in 2024, tracking 11.3 million interactions with
servicemembers and their families, and will open new brick-and-
mortar centers in Singapore and Louisiana in 2025. In 2023, the
USO launched the first USO Center aboard a Navy ship, the USS
George H. W. Bush (CVN 77), and has since expanded this initia-
tive to seven additional aircraft carriers including the USS Dwight
D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), USS George Washington (CVN 73), USS
Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), USS Ger-
ald R. Ford (CVN 78), USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), and USS
Ronald Reagan (CVN 76). Working with the Navy, the USO plans
to open centers on two additional carriers in 2025 as well as all
new Ford-class carriers as they are completed, per Navy’s request
for the expansion of this successful pilot program.

121
Accordingly, the committee encourages robust funding for the
USO to ensure that it can continue to meet the ever-evolving needs
of servicemembers and their families.
Development of regular military compensation pay table
The committee recognizes the importance of clearly commu-
nicating the full value of military compensation to servicemembers,
their families, and the public. While the Department of Defense
(DOD) currently publishes basic pay tables annually, these tables
do not fully reflect the comprehensive nature of regular military
compensation (RMC), which includes not only basic pay but also
basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, retire-
ment benefits, educational assistance, medical insurance, and the
associated federal tax advantages.
To enhance transparency and better inform servicemembers
about their total compensation package, the committee directs the
Secretary of Defense to develop an annual regular military com-
pensation pay table that presents the total estimated value of RMC
across all ranks and years of service. The pay table should include
explanatory materials to help servicemembers understand the full
scope of their compensation.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than February 1,
2026, outlining the methodology used to calculate the RMC figures,
including assumptions related to housing location, dependency sta-
tus, and tax treatment. The briefing should provide a sample of the
aforementioned annual regular military compensation pay table
that presents the total estimated value of RMC across all ranks
and years of service. The briefing also should address the advis-
ability and feasibility of publishing the RMC pay table annually
alongside the basic pay table and should describe the steps the
DOD would take to effectively communicate this information to the
force.
Exempted positions from Deferred Resignation Program
The committee recognizes the importance of maintaining a mis-
sion-ready civilian workforce within the Department of Defense
(DOD) and ensuring that critical positions are not adversely im-
pacted by workforce reduction initiatives. The committee recognizes
that the Deferred Resignation Program as implemented in the De-
partment of Defense permitted voluntary workforce reductions and
included mission essential exemptions.
The committee is aware that certain categories of personnel, in-
cluding military personnel, have been historically exempted from
similar programs and that Title 32 Dual Status Technicians play
a critical role in maintaining the readiness of National Guard for-
mations. Given the urgency of exemption requests submitted by the
National Guard Bureau and the time-sensitive nature of the pro-
gram, the committee is concerned about the lack of clarity regard-
ing the positions that have been formally exempted by DOD leader-
ship.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate

and the House of Representatives, not later than December 1,
2025, detailing all positions and occupational categories granted ex-
emptions from the Deferred Resignation Program. This report
should include: (1) A comprehensive list of all exempted positions,
including pay plan, occupational series, grade, and title; (2) The
justification provided for each exemption; and (3) The process by
which exemption requests were reviewed and approved.
Military housing price setting software report
The committee is concerned about landlords’ potential collusion
and use of price-setting algorithms to artificially raise rents to
pocket basic allowance for housing (BAH) increases. The committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a report to the Commit-
tees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, by not later than March 1, 2026, on the Department of De-
fense’s plan to strengthen oversight into the potential use of algo-
rithmic pricing in military communities. The report should include
information on the extent to which landlords in military commu-
nities utilize price-setting software, including RealPage, to set
apartment rents paid by servicemembers using BAH.
Report on student loan challenges for servicemembers
The student loan landscape has shifted significantly in recent
years, including for servicemembers. The committee directs the
Comptroller General of the United States to review the student
loan repayment challenges of servicemembers. This review should
address: (1) What challenges servicemembers face in student loan
repayment, including challenges related to recent changes in repay-
ment procedures, third-party scams, and servicer misconduct; (2)
How federal agencies help servicemembers navigate these chal-
lenges; and (3) Any recommendations for the Congress and Federal
agencies to address these challenges. The committee further directs
the Comptroller General to periodically brief the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on
the status of this review and publish a report on the review not
later than March 1, 2026.
Use of surcharge funds for Defense Commissary infrastruc-
ture
The committee supports efforts to modernize, maintain, and im-
prove commissary facilities in order to ensure continued access to
affordable, high-quality groceries for servicemembers and their
families. The committee recognizes the importance of sustained in-
vestment in commissary infrastructure and acknowledges the role
that surcharge revenues can play in enabling these improvements.
To inform future decisions regarding the most appropriate and
effective use of surcharge proceeds in support of commissary sys-
tem infrastructure, and to ensure long-term sustainability of the
benefit, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit
a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, not later than January 1, 2026, that
includes: (1) An explanation of how current authorities under title
10, United States Code, particularly section 2484, are being used
to support the repair, maintenance, improvement, or modernization

of commissary facilities, including any constraints encountered in
applying surcharge funds to these purposes; (2) A description of
any additional authorities the Department of Defense believes are
needed to more effectively support commissary infrastructure,
along with the rationale for such changes; and (3) A summary of
how the Department would prioritize the use of surcharge funds,
if such additional funds are authorized for various facility-related
needs—including maintenance, repair, upgrades, or new construc-
tion—to ensure cost-effectiveness, alignment with operational re-
quirements, and equitable access for beneficiaries.

greater than the rank of any officer serving as the Surgeon General
of any military department. The provision would also require the
Director of the Defense Health Agency to be a joint qualified offi-
cer.
Sec. 712—Establishment of policies for priority assignment
of medical personnel of Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish policies for the priority assign-
ment of medical personnel of the Department of Defense. The pro-

Items of Special Interest
Access to obstetrician-gynecologist care
The committee has heard concerns about the availability of ob-
stetrician-gynecologist medical care available to TRICARE bene-
ficiaries, including servicemembers, at Fort Drum, New York. The
committee therefore directs the Secretary of Defense to brief the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than December 1, 2025, on the adequacy
and sufficiency of obstetrician-gynecologist care available to
TRICARE beneficiaries in the vicinity of Fort Drum, New York.
The briefing shall include: (1) An overview of the administrative
and cost barriers to expanding obstetrician-gynecologist care in the
Watertown, New York area; (2) An assessment of the feasibility
and advisability of expanding obstetrician-gynecologist care avail-
able at Fort Drum, New York; and (3) Any other relevant matters
that the Secretary deems appropriate.
Anomalous health incidents
The committee continues to strongly support the work of the De-
partment of Defense’s cross-functional team for addressing the
threats posed by emerging directed energy weapons, including
those that could plausibly result in anomalous health incidents
(AHI), and believes the efforts of the cross-functional team have

significantly advanced the Department’s understanding of the
threats these technologies pose to U.S. military, intelligence, and
other personnel. The committee believes the cross-functional team
has been an important and independent contributor to interagency
consideration of these issues.
The committee encourages the Department to continue to provide
the cross-functional team with adequate resources to continue its
efforts, particularly with respect to providing treatment for those
affected by AHIs and ensuring timely compensation under the
Helping American Victims Affected by Neurological Attacks Act of
2021 (Public Law 117–46). Lastly, the committee encourages the
Department, via the cross-functional team, to redouble efforts to
characterize emerging directed energy threats, understand their or-
igin, and develop countermeasures.
However, the committee is concerned that the Defense Health
Program budget request cuts AHI research and seeks to eliminate
the stand-alone project code. The committee strongly encourages
the Department to ensure robust funding for this force protection
research in fiscal year 2027.
Biologic vascular repair for warfighters
The committee notes that recent advancements in biologic vas-
cular repair technology, successfully deployed to front-line hospitals
in active conflict zones and austere environments, have resulted in
Food and Drug Administration-approved innovations that present
new opportunities to enhance care for servicemembers with vas-
cular injuries sustained on the battlefield. These regenerative med-
icine technologies are off-the-shelf, universally implantable, dem-
onstrate low susceptibility to infection, and can mitigate challenges
associated with traditional vascular repair methods.
Therefore, the committee encourages the Joint Trauma System
(JTS) to evaluate and, if advisable, incorporate these innovations
into the standard protocol in military trauma care. In particular,
the JTS should evaluate these advancements for use in treating ex-
tremity arterial injury when urgent revascularization is needed to
avoid imminent limb loss and when autologous vein graft is not
feasible.
Blast overpressure data modernization
The committee notes section 724 of the Servicemember Quality
of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) included a provision to ad-
dress servicemember brain health and directed the Secretary of De-
fense to establish roles and responsibilities central to the docu-
mentation of blast overpressure exposure. The committee believes
the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to capture, protect, store, and
disseminate information regarding blast overpressure and trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) in training and operational environments
is critical to ensure the health and readiness of servicemembers
and provide decision support to leaders across the care continuum.
The committee supports the ongoing efforts by the Defense
Health Agency (DHA) to modernize data and analytical capabilities
to support healthcare across the Military Health System through
the Digital Front Door initiative. Therefore, the committee directs

the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs
and the DHA to leverage progress made in AI and data moderniza-
tion through the Digital Front Door initiative to expedite the use
of AI and data modernization capabilities, facilitating the dissemi-
nation of information regarding blast overpressure and TBI in ac-
cordance with the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public
Law 118–159).
Briefing on feasibility of Department of Defense partnership
with non-profit academic medical center to study trau-
matic brain injury
The committee continues to be concerned about emerging infor-
mation indicating the detrimental whole-health impact of repeated
blast overpressure exposure on members of the Armed Forces. Re-
search has shown an association between blast exposure and al-
tered brain structure, compromised brain function, and numerous
medical comorbidities impacting both physical and psychological
health. Those negative health impacts are pointing to early
maladaptive aging that impacts force readiness and long-term
health. In the post-9/11 conflicts, there has been a surge in train-
ing-related demands and combat exposures for members of the
Armed Forces, in particular among members serving in special op-
erations units.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than June 1, 2026, on
the feasibility and advisability of conducting a longitudinal medical
study with a non-profit academic medical center that specializes in
traumatic brain injury and has documented experience working
with special operations personnel on traumatic brain injury, includ-
ing medical comorbidity evaluation and treatment, to analyze spe-
cial operations personnel health data.
Briefing on telehealth-enabled solutions for treatment of
musculoskeletal injuries
The committee is aware of the Defense Health Agency’s ongoing
efforts to improve access to healthcare for the millions of bene-
ficiaries enrolled in the military healthcare system. In addition to
broadening accessibility under the managed care network, recruit-
ing and retaining military medical providers, and achieving full
operational use of military medical facilities, exploring remote and
telehealth capabilities will be critical in sustaining the military
healthcare system as a high-quality benefit for servicemembers, re-
tirees, and military families.
Therefore, not later than March 1, 2026, the Secretary of Defense
shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives a briefing on the feasibility and
advisability of implementing telehealth-enabled therapeutic solu-
tions for the treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal (MSK)
injuries for members of the Armed Forces. This report should in-
clude: (1) A review of existing telehealth-enabled MSK solutions,
including pilot programs, and an assessment of the costs and bene-
fits of such solutions relative to in-person MSK treatments, includ-

member access to telehealth-enabled MSK solutions as a means to
enhance readiness and address barriers to compliance with in-per-
son physical therapy protocols; and (3) Any other relevant matters
that the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate.
Comptroller General review of blast overpressure docu-
mentation implementation
The committee remains concerned about the impact of blast over-
pressure exposure on servicemembers and their brain health. To
ensure that the Department of Defense is conducting timely imple-
mentation of congressional reforms in the Servicemember Quality
of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159), the committee directs the
Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a review of
the following:
(1) The status of implementation of blast overpressure re-
forms included in Public Law 118–159, including Sections 721
through 725, and any related report language in Senate Report
118–188;
(2) The status of each of the services in implementing base-
line cognitive assessments, as mandated under the August
2024 memorandum on ‘‘Department of Defense Requirements
for Managing Brain Health Risks from Blast Overpressure,’’
and regular follow-up assessments for servicemembers to track
brain health over their career;
(3) The progress of the Department and services in estab-
lishing and maintaining blast overpressure exposure logs and
traumatic brain injury logs and other documentation on expo-
sure for servicemembers; and
(4) Any steps the Department is taking to address the poten-
tial link between blast overpressure exposure and risks of sui-
cide.
The committee directs the Comptroller General to provide a
briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee on preliminary
findings, not later than April 1, 2026, with the results to follow in
a report and in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General study on impact of behavioral and
mental health staffing shortfalls at military medical
treatment facilities
The committee recognizes the importance of robust mental and
behavioral health care for military personnel and their families.
The committee is aware of a shortfall of behavioral and mental
health staffing in military medical treatment facilities, resulting in
the lack of timely mental health care for authorized beneficiaries.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller General of
the United States to conduct a study on: (1) Behavioral and mental
health staffing shortfalls at military medical treatment facilities
within the contiguous United States; (2) The impact of such short-
falls on access to care for Active-Duty members of the Armed
Forces; and (3) The effectiveness of steps to mitigate those impacts
and improve access to behavioral and mental health care for such
members.

The study should include an assessment of the following: (1) The
number of positions filled and the number of positions vacant at
military medical treatment facilities, including positions for behav-
ioral health and mental health providers in specialty clinics, behav-
ioral health consultants in primary care clinics, and other positions
that affect appointment availability for behavioral health services;
(2) The availability and timeliness of behavioral health and mental
health appointments for Active-Duty members of the Armed Forces
at military medical treatment facilities and through civilian pro-
vider networks under the TRICARE program (as defined in section
1072 of title 10, United States Code); and (3) An assessment of the
steps to be taken by the Department of Defense to help military
medical treatment facilities alleviate demand on behavioral health
and mental health providers and increase appointment availability
for behavioral health services, including by implementing new
triaging approaches, increased use of telehealth and behavioral
health technicians, hiring and retention support, or other strate-
gies.
The committee directs the Comptroller General to brief the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on this study, not later than January 12, 2026, with
a report to follow by a date mutually agreed upon at the time of
the briefing.
Continuing medical education for military professionals
The committee recognizes the important role of attendance at
professional conferences for military health professionals. Attend-
ance and participation in local, national, and international con-
ferences benefits military medical professionals and improves our
military’s readiness.
The committee understands that conference attendance is a vital
way to transfer and acquire knowledge and lessons learned to im-
prove patient care and reduce casualties, foster collaboration and
innovation, and obtain Continuing Medical Education (CME) cred-
its. Professional conferences improve readiness by connecting junior
military medical professionals with experienced combat veterans
who have deployed multiple times to combat regions, many of
whom are no longer in the military but remain active at national
conferences. They also provide settings to strengthen military-civil-
ian partnerships. Furthermore, attendance is a retention tool as it
improves morale, allows for professional development, and provides
opportunities for academic recognition that improves military phy-
sicians’ promotions into leadership positions.
Despite these benefits, military attendance at professional con-
ferences has declined over the last decade, at least in part due to
bureaucratic obstacles, lack of support from leadership, inadequate
funding, and a general undervaluing of the role national academic
medical conferences can play in maintaining our national strategic
advantage. The committee encourages the Department of Defense
to allocate resources toward and facilitate increased attendance of
military health professionals at professional conferences.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the Director of the
Defense Health Agency, Service Secretaries, and the Defense

cate resources toward and facilitate military health professionals’
increased attendance at professional conferences, as well as rec-
ommendations to overcome barriers to doing so.
Department of Defense pharmaceutical supply chain report
The committee is concerned by the challenges to ensuring
servicemembers have access to safe, high-quality, and effective
pharmaceutical drugs. The committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense to provide a briefing and report to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than July 1, 2026, on the Department of Defense’s (DOD) pur-
chasing of drugs and medical countermeasures, including the vol-
umes purchased and costs of these purchases, whether it has expe-
rienced any difficulties with supply challenges, including but not
limited to shortages related to each of these drugs, and any short-
falls. The report shall include the following information:
(1) DOD’s annual procurement of each of these drugs and
medical countermeasures, over the past 5 years, including the

Foreign adversary threats to genetic medicine supply
chains
The committee remains concerned over potential threats to the
supply chains for genetic medicine, particularly for
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based tech-
nologies. It is imperative to protect advanced technologies from
supply chain disruption. Therefore, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than April 1,
2026, on: (1) Vulnerabilities related to bulk transfer of genetic in-
formation to foreign adversaries with potential application for fur-
ther development of adversarial DNA and RNA technologies; (2)
Recommendations for how foreign adversary access to bulk genetic
information and technology can be restricted; (3) Recommendations
for further restricting foreign adversary participation in U.S. sup-
ply chains for DNA and RNA technologies; and (4) Any other items
the Secretary determines relevant.

ment policy and personnel support.
Medical licensure portability for the National Guard
The committee recognizes the essential role that National Guard
(NG) healthcare providers (HCPs) play in contributing to our
Armed Forces’ medical corps and medical enterprise. They are
asked to maintain a high level of readiness to deploy at a moment’s
notice to provide expert medical care to and save the lives of Amer-
icans during natural disasters or to servicemembers during mili-
tary operations. This high level of readiness depends on the ability
of NG HCPs to maintain expert proficiency through regular hands-
on trainings and certifications, especially on the kind of trauma
care most relevant to injuries during emergency or conflict sce-
narios.
The committee is aware that to obtain such specialized training,
NG HCPs may be required to travel to a completely different State
for annual training or other stateside operational missions requir-
ing medical support. The committee supports NG HCPs having
ready and easy access to the best cross-state training opportunities.
In order to streamline access by NG HCPs to cross-state training,
the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health
Affairs, in consultation with the Chief of the National Guard Bu-
reau, to provide a briefing, not later than March 31, 2026, to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on licensure portability for National Guard med-
ical providers and whether existing law presents barriers to gener-
ating readiness.
Military efforts to mitigate risks of antimicrobial resistance
The committee notes that one of the risks for servicemembers
with traumatic injuries is developing wound infections, especially
in austere environments. Bacteria or fungi that are resistant to
multiple antibiotics are growing domestically and globally. This has
become an increasing challenge for military causalities in Europe,
Asia, and Africa.

Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs, in consultation with the Joint Staff Sur-
geon, to provide a briefing, not later than May 2, 2026, to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives summarizing Department of Defense efforts to detect
and mitigate antimicrobial resistance in the military health sys-
tem. The briefing should include the following: (1) An assessment
of the risk to military forces associated with antimicrobial resist-
ance; (2) A summary of the actions taken by the Director of the De-
fense Health Agency and the Surgeons General of the military de-
partments to mitigate the risks identified; and (3) Any other mat-
ters the Secretary determines to be relevant.
Military Health System facilities
The committee is concerned that there are not enough civilian or
military healthcare centers to treat the high number of casualties
likely to result from large-scale combat operations. Furthermore,
Military Health System care facilities face large, under-funded in-
frastructure requirements to upgrade often aging buildings. Given
the rising costs of healthcare coverage, which divert funding from
operational medical requirements, and other pressures on the De-
partment of Defense’s budget, there is an opportunity to consider
other financing mechanisms for improving Military Health System
care facilities. One option that has been successfully employed for
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare facilities is the
Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements
Needed for Veterans Act (CHIP–IN Act), which established a pilot
program to empower local communities to assist in the planning
and construction of VA healthcare facilities by leveraging private
financing and support. The committee believes that such a mecha-
nism might hold similar promise for Department of Defense facili-
ties.
Accordingly, the committee directs that the Secretary of Defense
brief the congressional defense committees, not later than March 1,
2026, on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a similar
program whereby local communities can assist with the planning
and construction of Department of Defense healthcare facilities
through privately subsidizing projects and other means of support.
The briefing should specifically address whether the CHIP–IN Act
could serve as a model for the Department of Defense to establish
a similar initiative which will effectively address any potential
shortfalls in military medical services during large-scale combat op-
erations.
Military medical personnel timecards
The committee notes that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) re-
quires military medical personnel to submit timecards to document
how these personnel are allocating their duty and leave hours. The
data from these timecards is important to address military staffing
challenges in military treatment facilities (MTFs). The committee
is aware that there are many limitations, inconsistencies, and inac-
curacies associated with the current timecard system.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs to submit a semi-annual briefing on the

timecard data compiled by the Defense Health Agency, not later
than January 15, 2026, and continuing every 6 months thereafter
until December 31, 2028. These briefings should include the fol-
lowing: (1) The number of hours military medical personnel are
spending in each timecard category, broken out by type of provider
(e.g. exclusively assigned to an MTF, dual-assigned to a non-MTF
unit, or period-intermittently assigned to an MTF), military depart-
ment, and Defense Health Network; (2) An assessment of whether
military personnel are accurately completing timecard submissions
as required by the DHA; and (3) Any other matters as determined
by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.
National Disaster Medical System pilot program
The committee notes that section 740 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92), as
amended by Section 741 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law
116–283), directed a pilot program to establish civilian and military
partnerships to enhance interoperability and medical surge capa-
bility and capacity of the National Disaster Medical System. While
the committee continues to support implementation of this pilot
program, the Department of Defense has been inconsistent in pro-
viding the committee with timely updates on the execution of the
program.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the Defense
Health Agency (DHA), in consultation with the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for Health Affairs, to provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than March 1, 2026, on the im-
plementation of the pilot program both as a whole and at each of
the five pilot sites. Specifically, the briefing should discuss DHA
initiatives to test and scale effective site-specific projects; any ini-
tial analysis of the pilot program in terms of cost and effectiveness;
and any preliminary recommendations for legislative or adminis-
trative actions such as extending the pilot program or making its
authority permanent.
Nonaddictive opioid alternatives
The committee remains concerned about the continued use of
opioids by active-duty and retired servicemembers for the treat-
ment of pain. The committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Health Affairs to provide a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
and publicly post on their website, not later than March 1, 2026,
on steps the Department will take to ensure that nonaddictive al-
ternatives to opioids are on the TRICARE Uniform Formulary. The
report shall include a timeline detailing when these medications
will be available to TRICARE beneficiaries once they have received
Food and Drug Administration approval.
On-demand intravenous fluids for expeditionary medicine
The committee recognizes that intravenous (IV) fluids have been
in limited supply domestically since 2014, even prior to the wide-
spread shortages caused by Hurricanes Maria and Helene. The
committee also recognizes the large quantities of resources required

by the Department of Defense to ship IV fluids around the world.
The committee supports the efforts undertaken by the Department
of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services to
develop a modular, self-contained, distributed, and sterile manufac-
turing platform for IV fluids. The committee recognizes that this
platform requires modifications to succeed in the contested logistics
domains, including rapid detection of endotoxin.
Therefore, the committee encourages budgeting for sterile IV
fluids for expeditionary medicine in fiscal year 2027 and beyond.
Additionally, the committee encourages the military services to en-
gage directly with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order
to expedite the review process related to on-demand fluids in for-
ward operating locations.
Private sector support for multi-patient movement contin-
gency requirements
The committee notes that rapid movement of wounded, ill, and
injured servicemembers is critically important in contingency oper-
ations. The committee is aware that the Joint Staff, U.S. Transpor-
tation Command (TRANSCOM), and the Global Patient Movement
Joint Advisory Board have analyzed the projected military airlift
capacity and medical operations required to support patient move-
ment from outside the continental United States to the continental
United States (CONUS) and then to distribute patients within
CONUS in accordance with the National Disaster Medical System
guidance and the Integrated Continental United States Medical
Operations Plan. The analysis demonstrated a shortfall of military
airlift and fully equipped medical crews to provide comprehensive
aeromedical services.
To address these gaps, the committee understands the Defense
Health Agency issued a request to augment the Department of De-
fense’s (DOD) aeromedical evacuation system with commercial
wide-body aircraft capable of interoperability with the military sys-
tem to achieve patient movement within CONUS. As a proof of con-
cept, TRANSCOM invited private sector partners to participate in
the Ultimate Caduceus 2024 exercise at Travis Air Force Base. The
private sector demonstrated an ability to provide an appropriately
configured aircraft with supplies and medical crews identical to
current DOD patient movement standards.
With appropriate planning, this exercise proved a civilian capa-
bility to provide large-volume patient movements to augment the
military aeromedical evacuation system during contingencies. The
committee applauds this outstanding example of a military-civilian
partnership critical to enhancing medical casualty evacuation
worldwide and encourages the DOD to continue exercising these
capabilities with regularity.
TRICARE contingency planning
The Defense Health Agency (DHA) administers the TRICARE
program to provide healthcare benefits to beneficiaries in Depart-
ment of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and
clinics, as well as through participating civilian healthcare provider
networks. In the event of significant numbers of combat casualties
that exhaust the current Departments of Defense and Veterans Af-

fairs’ capacity, the National Disaster Medical System exists to sup-
plement military healthcare systems and response capabilities.
However, the committee believes that further analysis is required
to understand the ability of DHA to efficiently coordinate care
among civilian providers in the event of large-scale combat oper-
ations.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director, DHA, in consulta-
tion with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 1, 2026, on the feasibility and advisability of
modifying TRICARE’s Managed Care Support Contract to better
prepare for the high casualties likely to result from large-scale
combat operations. The briefing should specifically consider the fea-
sibility and advisability of adding an emergency clause to private
medical providers’ contracts with TRICARE that would account for
all medical needs of the Department of Defense in the contiguous
United States.
TRICARE pharmacy briefing
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a con-
fidential briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee once
each 180 days, beginning February 1, 2026, and ending on Feb-
ruary 1, 2029, on the difference in reimbursement rates or prac-
tices, direct and indirect remuneration fees or other price conces-
sions, and clawbacks between: (1) Pharmacies that are affiliates of
TRICARE’s contracted pharmacy benefit manager; and (2) Phar-
macies that are not affiliates of TRICARE’s contracted pharmacy
benefit manager.
The briefing shall also include the amount of any administrative
fee received by the contracted pharmacy benefit manager for each
prescription such contractor processes under TRICARE’s pharmacy
program.
TRICARE provider and beneficiary complaint mechanism
The committee continues to hear from TRICARE providers and
beneficiaries about issues that cannot be resolved directly through
regional managed care support contractors. The committee is fur-
ther aware that when providers and beneficiaries are faced with
these situations, they do not have effective mechanisms through
which they can file complaints directly to the Defense Health Agen-
cy (DHA).
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the Defense
Health Agency to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 1, 2026, describing: (1) How DHA oversees complaint
resolution processes operated by the TRICARE-managed care sup-
port contractors; (2) How DHA assesses the performance of those
complaint resolution processes; (3) How DHA assists beneficiaries
and providers who have been told that a managed care support
contractor cannot resolve the issue; (4) How DHA makes bene-
ficiaries and providers aware of that process; and (5) How DHA is
seeking to address concerns from beneficiaries and providers that
they cannot resolve issues through the existing complaint resolu-
tion processes.

U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay
The committee is aware that the Defense Health Agency is con-
sidering realigning healthcare resources in military treatment fa-
cilities, including U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
where over 4,000 personnel are permanently assigned and have no
access to care within the immediate area of the base. The com-
mittee notes that Section 715 of the James M. Inhofe National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263)
prevents the Secretary of Defense from modifying the scope of med-
ical care before certifying to Congress the extent to which the com-
mander at each military installation has been consulted regarding
the proposed modification. The committee notes that despite delib-
erations regarding the downsizing of the U.S. Naval Hospital in
Guantanamo Bay, the committee has not received the required no-
tification under law.
Due to the lack of alternative providers adjacent to U.S. Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay; potential inpatient responsibilities as-
signed in certain U.S. Southern Command plans; and the require-
ment to treat TRICARE beneficiaries, local employees, law of war
detainees, and future contingency operation personnel, the com-
mittee urges the Department of Defense to maintain adequate
medical services and justify to Congress as required under statute
any proposed reduction of medical care at U.S. Naval Hospital in
Guantanamo Bay.
Unified joint military trauma system
The committee is aware of the challenges the future battlespace
will place on combat medical operations and the need for modern-
ized casualty care. The committee recently received testimony on
the readiness of the Military Health System, which noted that the
Department of Defense lacks ‘‘a coherent, unified strategy for mili-
tary medical readiness that will deliver expert trauma/burn care on
future battlefields while also benefitting civilian trauma care and
public health.’’ Additionally, the testimony suggests the Uniformed
Services University is currently developing a comprehensive mili-
tary trauma system policy roadmap that considers the direct care
component, civilian partnerships, the role of the National Guard
and Reserve, synergy with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and
involvement with the National Disaster Medical System and Na-
tional Trauma Emergency Preparedness System.
The committee directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Health Affairs to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the sta-
tus of the military trauma system policy roadmap not later than
March 1, 2026. The briefing shall include the following elements:
(1) A list of the organizations involved in the development of
the military trauma system policy roadmap effort;
(2) An explanation of the objectives, status, and anticipated
completion date of the updated policy;
(3) An assessment of any barriers inhibiting the Department
from implementing the updated military trauma system policy;
and
(4) Any other matters the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Health Affairs considers relevant.

Wound care and management in future combat
The committee commends the Department of Defense for its con-
tinued activities focused on treating injuries sustained by
servicemembers in austere environments. The committee is aware
of the challenges the future battlespace will place on medical sup-
port operations and the need for modernized casualty care capabili-
ties for combat operations, including wound care and management.
The committee is concerned with the lack of a comprehensive
Military Health System strategy to address wound care and man-
agement, encompassing advances in research, development, clinical
care, and education and training to deliver lifesaving pre-hospital
wound care, stabilize battlefield casualties, and enhance readiness
with robust return to duty rates.
Therefore, the committee encourages the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Health Affairs to convene a working group of subject
matter experts to develop a strategy for wound care and manage-
ment, including prevention, treatment, and advanced wound care
to address wound infection in future operational environments.
The committee also directs that, not later than March 1, 2026,
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs submit a
briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives that includes: (1) Identification of and
recommendations to amend clinical practice guidelines to treat
combat wounds in future battlespaces; (2) Identification of and rec-
ommendations for education and training needs and military-civil-
ian partnerships applicable to the advancement of wound care and
management following combat injury; and (3) A summary of any
engagement with industry and academic medical institutions to
support partnerships to address the wound care and management
needs of servicemembers in future operational environments.

TITLE VIII—ACQUISITION POLICY, ACQUISI-
TION MANAGEMENT, AND RELATED MAT-
TERS
Subtitle A—Acquisition Policy and Management
Sec. 801—Transition of program executive officer role to
portfolio acquisition executive
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1737(a) of title 10, United States Code, to redefine program ex-
ecutive officers as portfolio acquisition executives and provide such
portfolio acquisition executives with greater authorities and respon-
sibilities for requirements, resourcing, and acquisition.
Sec. 802—Capstone requirements
The committee recommends a provision that would create a new
section, 3209, to title 10, United States Code, to establish capstone
requirements for three or more portfolio acquisition executives in
consultation with the Joint Requirements Oversight Council to en-
able greater speed, agility, and innovation in fielding military capa-
bilities.
Sec. 803—Modification to acquisition strategy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4211 of title 10, United States Code, by modifying specific re-
quirements for acquisition strategies.
Sec. 804—Modifications to modular open systems approach
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 4401–4403 of title 10, United States Code, by clarifying defi-
nitions of the modular open systems approach and mandating im-
plementation plans, enforceable contract clauses, and centralized
digital repositories for modular system interfaces. The committee
notes that the provision seeks to reduce supplier dependency and
vendor lock by requiring non-proprietary, machine-readable inter-
faces to facilitate third-party integration and system upgrades.
Sec. 805—Alternative test and evaluation pathway for des-
ignated defense acquisition programs
The committee recommends a provision that would establish an
alternative pathway for the test and evaluation (T&E) of software
acquisition programs using authorities in section 3603 of title 10,
United States Code, and other programs designated by the Sec-
retary of Defense.
The committee notes that the alternative test and evaluation
pathway would require programs to develop unified T&E strategies
integrating developmental and operational testing, exempt covered

programs from traditional requirements like T&E Master Plans
and milestone-specific tests, and require robust data strategies
with government-owned test data. Finally, the committee notes
that, under this provision, the Director of Operational Test and
Evaluation retains independent oversight, focusing on data suffi-
ciency and continuous analysis without mandating specific test
plans. Under this provision, the Secretary of Defense must issue
implementation guidance, not later than 180 days after the date of
the enactment of this Act. The Secretary must also submit a report
to the congressional defense committees on the pathway’s effective-
ness, not later than 3 years after the enactment of this Act.
Sec. 806—Department of Defense member of Cost Account-
ing Standards Board
The committee recommends a provision that, pursuant to section
1501 of title 41, United States Code, would designate the Director
of Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy as the De-
partment of Defense member of the Cost Accounting Standards
Board.
Sec. 807—Combatant command experimentation authority
The committee recommends a provision that would provide the
combatant commands the authority to conduct experimentation,
prototyping, and technology demonstrations to support the develop-
ment and testing of innovative technologies and capability solu-
tions to address operational needs identified by the combatant com-
mand.
Subtitle B—Amendments to General Contracting
Authorities, Procedures, and Limitations
Sec. 821—Modifications to nontraditional defense contractor
definitions
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3014 of title 10, United States Code, to add to the definition
of a nontraditional defense contractor those business entities that
do not qualify as a covered segment as defined under the Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 231.205–18 or suc-
cessor regulation.
Sec. 822—Financing for covered activities
The committee recommends a provision that would allow financ-
ing costs to be allowable and allocable as a cost for federal con-
tracts and subcontracts with certain stipulations.
The committee recognizes the increasing availability of private-
sector financing opportunities to support, complement, and rein-
force defense and national security needs. The committee is encour-
aged that the Department of Defense and defense companies are
exploring ways to boost production of critical defense articles with
private sources of capital, which can support investments in supply
chains and capital improvements. Such investments are vital to fill
gaps where defense investment is unavailable or cannot be lever-
aged quickly enough to take advantage of fast-paced business cy-

cles. They can also help smooth over the uncertain cycles of govern-
ment appropriations.
The committee is increasingly aware that the distinctions be-
tween these types of private sector financing, including private cap-
ital, private equity, and venture capital, is important for the De-
partment to understand in order to make sure that is it using the
right tool for the right job. However, the committee notes that more
training, education, and encouragement is needed for a wider range
of acquisition officials in the Department to become familiar and
comfortable with using these tools. The committee encourages the
Secretary of Defense to do more to update Department regulations
and training in order to facilitate these arrangements.
Sec. 823—Exemptions for nontraditional defense contractors
The committee recommends a provision that would exempt non-
traditional defense contractors as defined by section 3014 of title
10, United States Code, from certain business requirements.
Sec. 824—Modifications to treatment of certain products
and services as commercial products and commercial
services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3457 of title 10, United States Code, to require contracting of-
ficers to treat nontraditional defense contractors at any tier of the
contract as commercial products and commercial services unless a
written determination is approved by the head of the contracting
activity, delegable no lower than the senior contracting official. The
committee notes that the provision would not make products and
services that are treated as commercial as a result of the contrac-
tor’s nontraditional defense contractor status eligible for the com-
mercial item preference as specified in section 3453 of title 10,
United States Code, unless a commercial item determination is also
made for the product or service.
Sec. 825—Modifications to commercial products and com-
mercial services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 3453 and 3456 of title 10, United States Code, to establish a
formal process for determining the non-availability of commercial
products or commercial services and require the contracting officer
and program manager of the Department of Defense (DOD) to sub-
mit written memoranda before using non-commercial solicitation
procedures, explaining the decision based on market research and
requirements analyses. The provision would also add consultants,
researchers, and advisors as acquisition officials to ensure their
compliance with rules prioritizing the preference for commercial
products and commercial services when supporting DOD market
research and requirements drafting.
Sec. 826—Modifications to commercial solutions openings
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3458 of title 10, United States Code, by expanding the pur-
poses for which the commercial solutions openings solicitation pro-
cedure may be used and creating an authority for sole-source fol-

low-on procurements provided the procedures of sections 4022 or
3204 of title 10, United States Code, are followed.
Sec. 827—Modifications to other transactions
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4022 of title 10, United States Code, to allow for follow-on pro-
duction authorities of other transaction agreements without a com-
petitive prototype if the capability has been demonstrated in a rel-
evant environment and the acquisition executive makes a written
determination.
Sec. 828—Modifications to procurement for experimental
purposes
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4023 of title 10, United States Code, by expanding the pur-
poses for which procurement is allowed for experimentation pur-
poses.
The committee notes that the Department of Defense has, in cer-
tain instances, applied procedures and requirements established
under sections 4021–4022 of title 10, United States Code, to trans-
actions executed under the authority of section 4023 of title 10,
United States Code, including requirements for competition and
certain cost-sharing arrangements. The committee clarifies that
section 4023 constitutes a distinct and separate authority from sec-
tions 4021–4022. Accordingly, purchases using mechanisms not
governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation made pursuant to
section 4023 are not subject to the procedures, requirements, or re-
strictions set forth in sections 4021–4022. This clarification ensures
that the Department of Defense may fully leverage the flexibility
provided by section 4023 to expedite and streamline acquisitions to
support experimentation as intended by the statute.
Sec. 829—Consumption-based solutions
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 253 of title 10, United States Code, by adding a new section
designated as section 3605. This section would make permanent
the procedures for consumption-based solutions that can be me-
tered and billed based on actual usage and have predetermined
pricing based on fixed price units.
Sec. 830—Modifications to prohibition on contracting with
persons that have fossil fuel operations with the Gov-
ernment of the Russian Federation or the Russian en-
ergy sector
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 804 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) by clarifying an exemption to the defini-
tion of business operations to include activities related to fulfilling
contracts with a fossil fuel company that has fossil fuel business
operations in the Russian Federation that were entered into prior
to the date of the enactment of the prohibition established in such
section.

Sec. 831—Modifications to relationship of other provisions
of law to procurement of commercial products and com-
mercial services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3452 of title 10, United States Code, to require identification
of defense-unique contract clause requirements for the procurement
of commercial products and commercial services that are based on
statute, Executive Orders, or acquisition policies.
Sec. 832—Limitation on required flowdown of contract
clauses to subcontractors providing commercial prod-
ucts or commercial services
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 247 of title 10, United States Code, by creating a new section,
3459, that would limit the required flowdown of contract clauses
for subcontracts and supply agreements providing commercial prod-
ucts or commercial services.
Sec. 833—References in contracts to Department of Defense
policy documents, instructions, and manuals
The committee recommends a provision that would clarify that
references to Department of Defense policy documents, instruc-
tions, and manuals in contracts shall contain a specific version or
date.
Sec. 834—Uninsurable risk on certain contracts
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Department of Defense to consider equitable adjustments for the
loss of work in process on certain uninsurable contracts.
Sec. 835—Reporting of price increases
The committee recommends a provision that would establish sec-
tion 3709 of title 10, United States Code, to require contractors on
cost-reimbursable sole source contracts to inform the contracting of-
ficer of the Department of Defense of product and services that are
25 percent above the price specified in the contract bid, 25 percent
above the price the Government paid in the previous year, or 50
percent above the price paid 5 years earlier.
Sec. 836—Instructions for continued operational readiness
The committee recommends a provision that would establish sec-
tion 4664 of title 10, United States Code, to require contractors for
covered equipment to provide maintenance, repair, and operational
information to ensure operational readiness.
Sec. 837—Indemnification of contractors against nuclear
and unusually hazardous risks
The committee recommends a provision that would define the
process by which the Department of Defense reviews requests by
contractors for indemnification against nuclear and unusually haz-
ardous risks. The provision would stipulate that final decisions on
approval or denial of such requests be completed within 90 days.

Sec. 838—Late submission of cost and pricing data as in-
valid defense to contract price reductions for defective
cost or pricing data
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 3706(c) of title 10, United States Code, to limit a prime con-
tractor or subcontractor from submitting after the date of agree-
ment on the price of a contract any cost or pricing data obtained
or otherwise made available more than 30 days before the date of
agreement on the price of a contract.
Sec. 839—Modifications to submissions of cost or pricing
data
The committee recommends a provision that would increase the
threshold requiring the submission of certified cost or pricing data
under section 3702 of title 10, United States Code, from $2.0 mil-
lion to $10.0 million for prime contracts entered into after June 30,
2026.
The committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acqui-
sition and Sustainment to conduct a study on the impacts of ex-
emptions from, or raising the threshold from $2.0 million to $10.0
million for, requirements for contractors and subcontractors to sub-
mit certified cost or pricing data under section 3702 of title 10,
United States Code, on the willingness of companies to participate
in the defense industrial base. The report shall be submitted to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than December 1, 2026, and annually
thereafter until December 1, 2028. The report shall include the fol-
lowing:
(1) An assessment of the change in the number of unique
contractors and subcontractors required to submit certified cost
or pricing data prior to any changes in statutory requirements
and after such changes, if applicable;
(2) An assessment of the total dollars covered by certified
cost or pricing data prior to any changes in statutory require-
ments and after such changes, if applicable;
(3) An assessment of the growth in the number of partici-
pants in the defense industrial base following any modifica-
tions to the certified cost or pricing data requirements, if appli-
cable; and
(4) Qualitative and quantitative evidence demonstrating

tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law
115–91).
Sec. 842—Small unmanned aircraft system industrial base
remediation plan
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, act-
ing through the Director of the Joint Production Accelerator Cell
and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy,
to develop a roadmap for the desired state of the small, unmanned
aircraft system (sUAS) industrial base to support existing sUAS
programs, not later than March 1, 2026. The provision also would
require that the Secretary of Defense submit the roadmap to the
congressional defense committees. The provision would also require
the Secretary of Defense to seek to enter into a contract with a fed-
erally funded research and development center to conduct a review
of the defense industrial base of the United States for sUAS compo-
nents and finished articles and to provide a report to the Secretary,
not later than September 30, 2026, with the Secretary providing
the report, along with comments, to the congressional defense com-
mittees, not later than 30 days thereafter.
The committee remains concerned about insufficient capacity and
capability within the defense industrial base for sUAS and the lack
of clear guidance and demand from the Department of Defense
(DOD) to industry to create a resilient, competitive, and effective
sUAS industrial base. The committee notes that the Congress has
enacted several provisions to limit Federal procurement of sUAS
and associated components produced in the People’s Republic of
China and to incentivize domestic production of sUAS. The com-
mittee believes that the ability to produce sUAS at scale to meet
the demands of the DOD depends on having access to a robust sup-
ply of critical components from domestic and allied sources, includ-
ing onshoring production and incentivizing private and Govern-
ment-owned manufacturing facilities to produce sUAS components
to support the development of this supply chain.
Sec. 843—Application of national security waiver for stra-
tegic materials sourcing requirement to sensitive mate-
rials
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4872 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary
of Defense or his authorized delegate to apply a national security
waiver determined under section 4863(k) of title 10, United States
Code, to section 4872 of title 10, United States Code, for the same
covered material and end item.
Sec. 844—Prohibition on acquisition of clothing and fabric
from countries of concern under domestic-sourcing
waivers
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4862 of title 10, United States Code, to prohibit the Depart-
ment of Defense from purchasing clothing or textiles from countries
of concern when an availability exception is granted due to the
nonavailability of domestically-sourced options.

Sec. 845—Mitigation of risks related to foreign ownership,
control, or influence of Department of Defense contrac-
tors or subcontractors
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation of not more than 90 percent of the travel expenses of the
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Secu-
rity until the Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional de-
fense committees that the requirements under section 847 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public
Law 116–92) have been implemented and submits a plan and
timeline for continued implementation of such requirements.
Sec. 846—Prohibition of procurement of molybdenum,
gallium, or germanium from non-allied foreign nations
and authorization for production from recovered mate-
rial
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4872 of title 10, United States Code, to add molybdenum,
gallium, and germanium to the definition of covered material, as
well as authorizes an exception to the prohibition for certain recov-
ered material.
Sec. 847—Sourcing options for certain critical products
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, as soon as practicable, but not later than fis-
cal year 2031, to ensure the Department of Defense maintains mul-
tiple sources for certain critical products.
Sec. 848—Prohibiting the purchase of photovoltaic modules
or inverters from Foreign Entities of Concern
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated by
this Act or otherwise made available to be used to enter into a con-
tract for the procurement of photovoltaic modules manufactured by
a foreign entity of concern.
Sec. 849—Modernization of Army arsenals
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of the Army to accelerate the modernization of the
Army’s organic industrial base to meet munitions requirements.
Sec. 849A—Modifications to Defense Industrial Base Fund
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4817 of title 10, United States Code, to provide additional au-
thorities and eligible uses for the Industrial Base Fund.

business entities outside of the geographic bounds of a center.
Subtitle E—Other Matters
Sec. 861—Clarification of procurement prohibition related
to acquisition of materials mined, refined, and sepa-
rated in certain countries
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 844(a) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) to
clarify that the authority is intended to apply to a contract for any
covered material mined, refined, or separated in any covered nation
entered into on January 1, 2027, and after, not to apply to end
items delivered by January 1, 2027, as previously noted by a De-
fense Federal Acquisition Regulation.
The committee understands that the Department of Defense will
have certain domestic or allied suppliers in place by the effective
date of the requirement to allow industry to meet the requirements
associated with section 844 by the required date.
Sec. 862—Independent study on the acquisition workforce of
the Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to contract with a qualified organization to
conduct an independent study of the defense acquisition workforce,
assessing its: (1) Effectiveness; (2) Recruitment; (3) Retention; (4)
Training; (5) Size; (6) Workload; and (7) Integration with related
fields like requirements and budgeting. The study seeks to assess
the use of metrics, career incentives, and modern tools to achieve
positive acquisition outcomes. The provision would require the Sec-
retary of Defense to submit the unaltered report from the qualified
organization, along with an assessment of the findings and rec-
ommendations, to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than December 31,
2027.
Sec. 863—Expedited acceptance program for supply chain il-
lumination
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize an
expedited acceptance waiver if a contractor, through the use of sup-
ply chain illumination procedures, discovers an item in the supply
chain that is non-compliant and implements a corrective plan to
ensure future compliance with existing requirements. The provision
would also require the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Sustainment to provide an annual briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
beginning not later than April 1, 2026, on the expedited accept-
ances authorized and corrective action plans of contractors to en-
sure future compliance.

fense committees, not later than 180 days after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, detailing the stockpiles of critical munitions re-
quired to fight simultaneous conflicts in different theaters. In addi-
tion, the provision would also require, not later than 90 days after
the report’s submission, the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan
to implement critical munitions requirements to fight simultaneous
conflicts in the next budget cycle.
The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense can
no longer assume that our adversaries are divided, that the United
States will be able to fight one war at a time, and that the United
States can fight one war while deterring aggression elsewhere. The
committee believes that the Department of Defense must be pre-
pared for simultaneous conflicts in multiple theaters. The com-
mittee also believes that, to prevent simultaneous conflicts, the
United States needs the forces necessary to demonstrate to our ad-
versaries the ability to fight and win in a conflict should deterrence
fail.
Sec. 865—Permanent extension and modification of dem-
onstration and prototyping program to advance inter-
national product support capabilities in a contested lo-
gistics environment
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 842 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to remove the 3-year sunset and to add
digital manufacturing as part of the prototyping program for con-
tested logistics.
Sec. 866—Estimate of ally and partner demand for United
States-produced munitions and specified expendables
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish an annual requirement for an es-
timate of the demand by U.S. allies and partners for U.S.-produced
munitions and specified expendables across the future-years de-
fense plan. Each estimate shall: (1) Be disaggregated by specific
munitions type and ally or partner; and (2) Include the following:
(a) analytical inputs such as information from foreign military
sales cases; (b) foreign partner munitions needs for operational or
contingency planning scenarios; (c) wargaming results that include
foreign partner contributions; and (d) estimates based on discus-
sions with foreign governments.
The committee notes that the war in Ukraine, Houthi attacks in
the Red Sea, and other instances have demonstrated the potential
for rapid depletion of munitions during conflict, which would be ex-
acerbated even further during a protracted conflict. The committee
remains concerned by the ability of the U.S. defense industrial base
to replenish munitions stockpiles and to surge production. The
committee believes that collaboration with allies and partners of-
fers economies of scale to maintain consistent production demand
and increase interoperability.

Sec. 867—Reform of contractor performance information re-
quirements
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Reg-
ulation Supplement (Part 242.15) to reform contractor performance
information requirements by establishing an objective, fact-based
system focused solely on verifiable negative performance events,
such as defective products, delinquent deliveries, or cybersecurity
breaches, in order to reduce subjectivity and administrative burden
while enabling identification of contractors with poor performance
histories. The revised system would eliminate subjective ratings in
the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System
(CPARS), implement a standardized scoring mechanism based on
transaction volume and contract value, and ensure transparency
for contractors. The provision also requires the Secretary of De-
fense to update regulations and CPARS guidance within 180 days
of the date of the enactment of this Act, with system modifications
completed within 1 year, and to submit a report on implementation
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, not later than 1 year after the date of the en-
actment of this Act. Additionally, the Comptroller General of the
United States shall review the new system’s effectiveness not later
than 3 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.
Sec. 868—Repeals of existing law to streamline the defense
acquisition process
The committee recommends a provision that would amend 86
sections of title 10, United States Code, and prior National Defense
Authorization Acts to repeal various statutory requirements related
to acquisition policies and processes and to reduce administrative
complexity related to reporting mandates, expired pilot programs,
outdated requirements, limitations, and other matters.
Sec. 869—Enhancement of defense supply chain resilience
and secondary source qualification
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 865 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public
Law 118–159) by expanding the scope of covered capabilities to in-
clude: (1) Critical readiness parts and systems; (2) Parts with sole-
source dependencies; (3) Excessive lead times; (4) Unreasonable
pricing; or (5) Other supply chain issues. The provision would es-
tablish Expedited Qualification Panels in each military department
to standardize and accelerate Source Approval Requests and Parts
Manufacturer Approvals within 14 days, utilizing conditional or
full approvals based on risk criteria. The provision would also pre-
vent duplicative review processes for aircraft parts already ap-
proved by civil aviation authorities, requiring written justification
for additional reviews. Finally, the provision would define critical
readiness parts and systems, safety critical items or mission-crit-
ical items, and non-safety critical items or non-mission-critical
items.

dress readiness issues such as Mission Impaired Capability Await-
ing Parts and Not Mission Capable Supply.
Sec. 871—Modifications to current defense acquisition re-
quirements
The committee recommends a provision that would amend a
number of defense acquisition requirements. The provision would
amend: (1) Section 1749 of title 10, United States Code, to remove
the requirement that certain funding be provided on a reimburs-
able basis; (2) Section 2222 of title 10, United States Code, to ex-
pand the definition of covered defense business systems; (3) Section
3012 of title 10, United States Code, to replace ‘‘lowest overall cost
alternative’’ with ‘‘best value’’ in acquisition criteria; (4) Section
3069 of title 10, United States Code, to simplify buy-to-budget au-
thority by removing conditions; (5) Section 3204 of title 10, United
States Code, to revise sole-source contract approval thresholds and
authorities; (6) Section 3226 of title 10, United States Code, to in-
crease the uses of the availability of excess funds; (7) Section 3243
of title 10, United States Code, to simplify contractor incentives by

contractor expansion of supply sources for critical readiness parts
and systems. The provision would also mandate contractual re-
quirements for supplier diversification, including Acquisition Meth-
od Suffix Code reclassification to reduce sole-source dependency,
expedited qualification processes, and the use of simulation-based
verification for certification. The provision also would require the
Secretary to enforce data rights and deliverables or initiate reverse
engineering to qualify new suppliers if design activities fail to com-
ply within 30 days of notification. Finally, the provision would re-
quire the Secretary to submit a report to the congressional defense
committees, not later than December 31, 2027, on the implementa-
tion and impact of these measures.

Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries to determine whether such equipment
should be designated as covered telecommunications equipment or
services under section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232). The
Secretary must brief the congressional defense committees on the
determination not later than December 1, 2026.
Sec. 878—Country-of-origin disclosure requirements for ge-
neric drugs purchased by the Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Department of Defense from procuring a generic drug for resale un-
less the seller discloses the country the generic drug was manufac-
tured in and the country of origin for all active pharmaceutical in-
gredients and key starting materials.
Sec. 879—Phase-out of computer and printer acquisitions in-
volving entities owned or controlled by China

Items of Special Interest
Advanced polymeric composite ammunition materials
The committee understands the importance of developing sources
of production of advanced polymeric composite materials for large
caliber ammunition. These materials have the potential to provide
significant benefits to the warfighter, such as weight reduction and
improving operational mobility. Advanced polymeric materials have
shown promise mitigating challenges with chamber heat, which

may lead to longer lifespan for weaponry. With the existing supply
chain challenges faced by the Department of Defense (DOD) with
critical materials, alternative options should be reviewed.
There is an urgent and ongoing need for state-of-the-art ammuni-
tion components and nonferrous, non-metallic materials capable of
withstanding extreme operational environments. Current global
threats and near-peer competition have underscored vulnerabilities
in traditional metals-based supply chains and exposed the neces-
sity for innovative, high-performance alternatives.
The committee believes the DOD should emphasize domestic ma-
terial sourcing and manufacturing to ensure resilient, secure sup-
ply chain integrity to support the warfighter.
Biosurveillance for servicemember readiness
The committee commends the Department of Defense (DOD) for
its coordinated efforts within the biodefense and medical research
community to support servicemember health and readiness. There
are a variety of existing efforts the Department undertakes to sup-
port early detection and risk awareness to inform decision-making
against naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate biological
threats. The committee understands that the Global Emerging In-
fections Surveillance (GEIS) program was created to improve infec-
tious disease surveillance, prevention, and response capability to
better protect the health of the Joint Force. The GEIS program re-
ceives input from multiple data sources.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than April
1, 2026, on the overall biosurveillance strategy designed to sustain
a biosurveillance program capable of forecasting potential threats
to servicemember health and readiness. The briefing should in-
clude: (1) Efforts to integrate biosurveillance platforms and data
streams supported through military-civilian partnerships with the
DOD’s laboratories; (2) Resourcing challenges or delays associated
with the platforms; (3) Agile acquisition instruments utilized to
sustain or deploy biosurveillance platforms; (4) The role the GEIS
program, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and any
other service-connected labs or surveillance entities play in sending
or analyzing biosurveillance data; (5) How the Department antici-
pates utilizing biosurveillance data moving forward; and (6) Any
other items the Secretary determines relevant.
Briefing on feasibility and advisability of biomanufacturing
in Indo-Pacific
The committee understands the supply chain benefits associated
with advanced biomanufacturing capabilities. Working toward for-
ward-deployed biomanufacturing capabilities could enhance the
readiness and lethality of the warfighter.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than June 1, 2026, on the feasibility and
advisability of conducting a pilot program on advanced bio-manu-
facturing for supply chain resilience and improved lethality in the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The evaluation of a potential pilot pro-
gram should include, but not be limited to: (1) The feasibility of

local sourcing of critical biologic materials in the region; (2) An as-
sessment of existing technology or capabilities that could be for-
ward-deployed to enhance readiness and lethality; (3) An evalua-
tion of the cost-effectiveness of using raw materials as close to the
point-of-manufacturing as possible; (4) A determination on the fea-
sibility and advisability of conducting such a pilot program and
what the associated costs would be; and (5) Any other matters the
Secretary determines relevant.
Briefing on Neodymium Iron Boron Magnets
The committee believes that investments in rare earth magnet
manufacturing and manufacturing equipment show potential to
make domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing more competitive
in the global marketplace. This would reduce reliance on foreign
adversaries for rare earth magnets such as neodymium iron boron
magnets (NdFeB), which are necessary for Department of Defense
requirements. NdFeB magnets are necessary for submarines, air-
craft, and missile guidance systems, but also for non-defense crit-
ical infrastructure. As such, the committee encourages the Depart-
ment of Defense to facilitate public and private sector cooperation
to establish manufacturing facilities and manufacturing equipment
produced in the United States. The committee directs the Secretary
of Defense to provide a briefing to the committee, not later than
March 1, 2026, on an analysis of domestic NdFeB manufacturing
in the United States or allied nations and identify barriers, includ-
ing resource constraints, to domestic rare earth magnet production.
Briefing on textile war reserve stocks
The committee is aware that the Defense Logistics Agency com-
missioned a wargame exercise in late 2023 to identify critical areas
of concern within the domestic clothing and textiles defense indus-
trial base. This exercise, conducted by the Center for Naval Anal-
yses, confirmed the weakness of the current supply chain and high-
lighted deficiencies and production gaps that could occur during fu-
ture operations. The wargame report highlighted how stockpiling of
critical material components and end items could provide a
logistical advantage by adding strategic excess of critical safety
items such as uniforms, footwear, and personal protective equip-
ment.
The military departments are required to maintain strategic war
reserve stocks of ‘‘go-to-war’’ items, including clothing and textiles
such as uniforms, footwear, and personal protective equipment, to
support the initial surge in requirements during a contingency. The
committee is concerned that the military services may not have
sufficient items in their existing war reserve stocks.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretaries of the military
departments to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than April 1, 2026, detailing their ‘‘go-to-war’’ textile items whose
demand may surge in the case of a contingency, including uni-

of uniform and personal protective equipment items across the
military services.
Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protective
equipment
The committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense is dependent on materials containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) to produce individual chemical, biological, radio-
logical, and nuclear (CBRN) protective equipment. The committee
notes that a growing number of private companies are exiting the
PFAS manufacturing business, given the adverse impact of PFAS
on the health and safety of servicemembers. The committee under-
stands that PFAS-free textile technologies can provide new per-
formance capabilities for individual CBRN protective equipment
and other key defense functions. The committee believes individual
CBRN protection is a key part of strategic deterrence against our
adversaries and is concerned that the Department will not be able
to provide the Joint Force with advanced individual CBRN protec-
tion equipment unless it accelerates efforts to acquire and field
PFAS-free textile technologies.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 30, 2026,
on the Department’s strategy and plans to acquire PFAS-free tex-
tile technologies for individual CBRN protective equipment as soon
as feasible. The briefing should include: (1) Current efforts to se-
cure the industrial base for PFAS-free textile technologies for indi-
vidual CBRN protective equipment; (2) A description of how ad-
vanced performance may enable new CBRN doctrines that enhance
survivability and lethality in contested environments; and (3) The
appropriations and authorities necessary to ensure these new tech-
nologies can be fielded by the start of fiscal year 2028.
Combatting viral pathogens and bioengineered viruses
The committee is aware of concerns regarding the rapid evolution
of viral pathogens and the potential for bioengineered viruses to be
weaponized by foreign adversaries, posing significant threats to na-
tional security and global stability. The committee is encouraged by
the ongoing work of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chem-
ical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense on the Genera-
tive Unconstrained Intelligent Drug Engineering program, which
began last year. The Department of Defense Chemical and Biologi-
cal Defense Program is adapting to the rapid evolution of viral
pathogens and the potential of bioengineered viruses, and it is
doing so by developing capabilities that could rapidly produce med-
ical countermeasures and other solutions to address and combat
the threat, regardless of the specific threat source, and by creating
additional medical countermeasures that are less risky altogether.
The committee believes that the way to combat these unknown
risks is to invest in capabilities that can prepare the Nation to
tackle any challenge rather than working toward a specific threat.

Commercial requirements evaluation
The committee is concerned that in some cases Department of
Defense (DOD) program managers apply non-commercial require-
ments against commercial products, negating the benefits of cost
and speed in using commercial products. Therefore, the committee
directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment to submit a report to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
February 1, 2026, on policies and procedures to prevent the unnec-
essary application of non-commercial requirements upon commer-
cial systems. Such a report shall also assess how the Department
can better leverage commercial test data to satisfy DOD develop-
mental, operational test, and safety release decisions.
Comptroller General assessment of information technology
contracts
The committee notes that the Secretary of Defense has issued
several memoranda related to cost efficiency and the elimination of
wasteful spending related to how certain information technology
(IT) programs are managed within the Department of Defense
(DOD). The memoranda, ‘‘Implementation of Executive Order
14222—Department of Government Efficiency Cost Efficiency Ini-
tiative,’’ dated May 27, 2025, and ‘‘Implementation of Department
of Government Efficiency Cost Efficiency Initiative,’’ dated June 23,
2025, directed the Department to take actions to, among other
things, terminate certain IT services contracts and move IT con-
sulting and management services from contract staff to government
employees. The latter memorandum articulates additional review
and approval requirements for such contracts.
The committee is concerned that such moves may have unfore-
seen consequences by misunderstanding or mischaracterizing some
relationships between commercial providers and integrators and
may not be informed by adequate cost analysis, which would help
understand the impacts on contract spending. In addition, the
move to eliminate some contract services and bring some functions
in-house seems divorced from a full understanding of the impact of
ongoing reductions in force, civilian workforce cuts, and hiring
freezes. The committee is concerned that such moves may exacer-
bate contracting timelines rather than make the process more effi-
cient or effective.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a review of the potential impact of these
memoranda, including: (1) Any additional implementation plans
and activities being undertaken by the DOD; (2) Input from indus-
try partners on their perception of the impacts of the memoranda;
(3) Assessment of any data on the cost impacts of such decisions;
(4) Assessment of the sufficiency of the civilian workforce to take
on identified insourcing initiatives; and (5) Any other items as the
Comptroller General deems appropriate. The committee further di-
rects the Comptroller General to brief the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later
than March 1, 2026, with a report to follow at a mutually agreed
upon date.

Comptroller General review of Office of the Director of
Operational Test and Evaluation
The committee acknowledges the Secretary of Defense’s initiative
to reorganize the Office of the Director of Operational Test and
Evaluation (DOT&E), as outlined in the March 27, 2025, memo-
randum titled ‘‘Reorganization of the Office of the Director of Oper-
ational Test and Evaluation.’’ The committee recognizes DOT&E’s
statutory responsibility under section 139 of title 10, United States
Code, to provide independent oversight of operational and live-fire
testing for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and other pro-
grams designated by the Director or the Secretary of Defense. This
role is essential to ensuring that weapons systems are evaluated
for suitability, survivability, and effectiveness in realistic oper-
ational environments.
The committee seeks additional information on the proposed re-
organization, which adjusts DOT&E’s workforce by more than 50
percent, to understand the balance between flexible acquisition
processes and effective oversight. To better understand the implica-
tions of this reorganization, the committee requires an objective as-
sessment of its impact on DOT&E’s mission.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to provide a briefing to the congressional defense
committees, not later than January 31, 2026, on the effects of the
DOT&E reorganization. This briefing shall include an evaluation
of: (1) The personnel adjustments and resulting organizational
structure of DOT&E; (2) The capacity of DOT&E to sustain inde-
pendent oversight of all Major Defense Acquisition Programs as re-
quired by statute under the new structure; (3) The ability of
DOT&E to conduct independent oversight of additional programs
on its oversight list, including Middle Tier Acquisition Programs,
classified programs, and those added at the discretion of the Direc-
tor or request of the Secretary of Defense; and (4) Any other rel-
evant considerations the Comptroller General deems appropriate
regarding the reorganization’s impact on DOT&E’s mission.
Comptroller General review of role of distributors in supply
chain
The committee is aware that manufacturers sometimes partner
with distributors for the sale of subsystems, components, and spare
parts to both commercial and government customers. The com-
mittee is also aware that in certain cases, such as when a part is
out of production or a manufacturer no longer supports a part, the
manufacturer may only sell the part through distributors to enable
manufacturers to focus on core business.
However, the committee is concerned that manufacturers may
have limited alternatives for parts and subcontractors in the mar-
ket, which influences their decision to enter into distributor rela-
tionships. The committee is further concerned about escalating part
pricing on weapon-system components and, in particular, sole
source spare parts for weapon systems that are out of production.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to provide a one-time report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than April 1, 2026, assessing the role of distributors in

the Department of Defense weapons system supply chain. The as-
sessment should include a statistically significant representative
sample of parts sold through distributors for weapon systems that
are in production as well as weapon systems that are no longer in
production, and should include an assessment of: (1) Any pricing
trends before and after the manufacturer established distributor
relationships for the part, taking into consideration relevant factors
such as inflation, material costs, production quantities, unique
Government requirements, and manufacturing set up costs; (2)
Why the manufacturer chose to partner with distributors; (3) Cat-
egories of terms and conditions that create undue burdens on the
supply chain such that the direct manufacturers of subsystems,
components, or spare parts may only sell through distributors; (4)
Any benefits that distributors provide, including for parts no longer
in production or with low production output; (5) The impact of
unique Government requirements on pricing of subsystems, compo-
nents, and spare parts offered through distributors; (6) Whether
distributors may apply downward pressure on part pricing, such as
through competition of one or more distributors or by placing or-
ders in higher quantities than manufacturers would otherwise keep
as stock on hand; (7) Whether the part is a commercial product;
and (8) Any other matters the Comptroller General deems nec-
essary.
Department of Defense battery strategy
The committee is aware that section 883 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) required the Sec-
retary of Defense to establish a Department of Defense-wide bat-
tery strategy, coordinated with the military services, to identify
and address the risks to the defense supply chain and material
shortages for legacy system batteries. The committee believes that
the strategy should also look forward with a plan for transitioning
the Department to safer batteries with higher energy capabilities
with opportunities for supply chain growth. Currently, the com-
mittee understands that the Department is working not only to
standardize battery requirements across the military services but
also to look forward at advancements in battery technology and
how to leverage commercial industry investment for defense needs.
The committee notes that some of these advancements include
fast-charging battery technology, with availability for Arctic condi-
tions. Significant investment continues to be made in the domestic
battery supply chain, and the committee encourages the Depart-
ment to prioritize batteries manufactured and sourced within the
United States or through allied partner nations pursuant to estab-
lished defense trade agreements. Innovation in cell and pack devel-
opment and manufacturing, pursued within a standardization ori-
entation, could lead to warfighter and platform superiority as well
as increase demand and predictability for the Department’s re-
quirements while ensuring consistent domestic supply and reduced
costs.
As the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense of Acquisition
and Sustainment, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Research and Engineering, and the military services work together

to standardize battery procurement, strategy, and innovation, the
committee encourages the consideration of the following: (1) The
ability of batteries to operate and recharge at temperatures as low
as ¥75°F; (2) Possible approaches for the creation and develop-
ment of cell, pack, and supply-chain and manufacturing innovation
and infrastructure; and (3) Existing efforts by the Office of Naval
Research on a seawater-activated lithium-ion battery that may pos-
sess more power than commercial alternatives. The committee
looks forward to the continued partnership with the Department on
ensuring advanced and standardized battery options for the
warfighter that come from domestic or allied sources.
Department of Defense coordination with broader chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threats
The committee understands the critical role that the Department
of Defense (DOD) has in broader Federal Government and private
sector efforts to address chemical, biological, radiological, and nu-
clear (CBRN) threats as well as emerging infectious diseases. The
Department possesses unique capabilities that contribute to inter-
agency efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks of infec-
tious disease worldwide. It is important for the Department to
prioritize and align investments in medical countermeasures
among all Federal stakeholders to ensure that effective counter-
measures are developed and to avoid duplication of efforts across
agencies.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Department to lever-
age private industry expertise to meet these requirements, to in-
crease efforts to coordinate capabilities at organizations with DOD
CBRN priorities, and to coordinate with civilian priorities through
the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enter-
prise.
Department of Defense supply chain mapping efforts
The committee remains concerned that there are far too many
places where the Department of Defense (DOD) and the defense in-
dustrial base are reliant on single sources of supply or adversary
sources for key components, subcomponents, critical minerals, and
raw materials. The committee is aware of several ongoing efforts
within the DOD to create internal supply chain mapping tools, as
well as efforts to contract for commercial products and services to
improve supply chain illumination across the Department. In work-
ing toward a more robust and resilient industrial base, the Depart-
ment should consolidate around one supply chain mapping tool
rather than working separately, in silos, on the problem.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on a supply chain
mapping strategy. This strategy should include: (1) An assessment
of existing supply chain mapping or illumination capabilities devel-
oped by or contracted for the Department; (2) Progress on the Sup-
ply Chain Risk Evaluation Environment (SCREEn) implementa-
tion, including any challenges with expansion; (3) An assessment
of commercially available tools that may be used to complement or
supplement SCREEn; (4) Any additional supply chain illumination

Department’s capability to utilize existing tools to determine coun-
try of origin for materials and single points of failure; and (6) Any
additional resources required to support the Department in improv-
ing supply chain mapping and illumination Department-wide. The
briefing may include a classified annex if required.
Efforts to accelerate bioindustrial manufacturing innova-
tion
The committee recognizes the importance of bioindustrial manu-
facturing capabilities as essential to maintaining the United States’
national security and global competitiveness. Biotechnology and
biomanufacturing provide innovative tools and capabilities that di-
rectly support Department of Defense (DOD) missions, strengthen
domestic supply chains, and reduce reliance on foreign sources for
critical materials. The committee is encouraged by DOD invest-
ments in a Bioindustrial Manufacturing Innovation Institute called
BioMADE. Despite substantial federal funding, slow deployment of
industry support risks placing the United States at a competitive
disadvantage compared to nations such as China, India, and coun-
tries within Europe that are rapidly advancing their own biomanu-
facturing capabilities.
The committee acknowledges the National Security Commission
on Emerging Biotechnology’s recommendations for Congress to
work with the DOD to ensure that BioMADE is using previously
appropriated funds effectively and quickly to establish facilities as
a part of a network of precommercial facilities, while also estab-
lishing clear mechanisms for collaboration and the leveraging of
these investments with other federal agencies.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than March 1, 2026, on the progress of the BioMADE manufac-
turing institute. The briefing shall include: (1) A timeline outlining
BioMADE’s plans to obligate and expend all remaining DOD-pro-
vided funds allocated, including timelines for issuing requests for
proposals, selecting sites, and initiating construction or partnership
activities; (2) A detailed description of the selection criteria
BioMADE uses when implementing DOD funding to support infra-
structure and workforce development investments; and (3) An ac-
counting of how DOD-provided funds and those collected through
BioMADE membership fees or other cost-sharing arrangements
have been utilized by the institute to date, specifying funded
projects, partnerships established, outcomes achieved thus far, and
how these expenditures align with broader DOD strategic objec-
tives in biomanufacturing.
Feasibility and advisability of a critical minerals index
The committee recognizes that the fluctuations of the critical
minerals market significantly impact private investment in non-
commodity materials. Without stable pricing, growth of the domes-
tic critical and strategic materials industry may not be able to meet
the Department of Defense’s requirements.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Industrial Base Policy to brief the Committees on Armed

lishing a price index for certain strategic and critical materials.
The briefing shall include but not be limited to: (1) A determination
of strategic and critical materials in shortfall for the National De-
fense Stockpile or currently under any trade or export restrictions
by a foreign entity of concern; (2) An assessment, in consultation
with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), of
how the Assistant Secretary could determine the maximum accept-
able exponential acquisition price for the materials; (3) A plan for
how the indexes could be utilized for the National Defense Stock-
pile or any other Department material acquisitions or investments;
(4) An analysis on the most appropriate forecasting capability, and
any potential for collaboration with private sector market partici-
pants through the Open Price Exploration for National Security
project of DARPA; and (5) Any other materials the Secretary deter-
mines relevant.
Feasibility and advisability of establishing biosurveillance
network at United States embassies and military instal-
lations overseas
The committee notes that the Department of Defense is con-
ducting ongoing efforts to improve infectious disease surveillance,
prevention, and response capability to better protect the health of
the Armed Forces across the world. With existing Department of
Defense capabilities, there could be opportunities to enhance the
biosurveillance networks through working with the interagency.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of State, to brief the Senate Armed
Services Committee, not later than June 1, 2026, on the feasibility
and advisability of expanding existing biosurveillance efforts to es-
tablish networks at U.S. embassies and military installations over-
seas. The briefing should include: (1) The feasibility and advis-
ability of expanding existing biosurveillance efforts to U.S. embas-
sies, including a cost assessment; (2) A review of military and dip-
lomatic facilities under the jurisdiction or control of the United
States that could be ideal candidates for an expanded biosurveil-
lance network based on the proximity of the facilities to high-risk
research, biological weapons research, geographic zoonotic spillover
risk, and the public health surveillance capacity in the country
where the facility is located; (3) Data protections required at the
potential locations to protect privacy and medical data; (4) A deter-
mination regarding the redundancy of this effort with ongoing De-
partment efforts in biosurveillance; and (5) Any other matters the
Secretary of Defense determines relevant.

The committee is concerned about the Department of Defense’s
efforts to improve how it identifies and mitigates risks to the de-
fense industrial base. For many years, the Department did not
have a consolidated or comprehensive strategy to address indus-
trial base risks. In its report published on July 7, 2022, titled ‘‘De-

166
Risk Mitigation Approach,’’ the Government Accountability Office
reported that the Department lacked such a strategy and did not
have performance measures to monitor the effectiveness of its miti-
gation efforts (GAO–22–104154). Further, the report found that the
Department struggled to report its progress in Annual Industrial
Capability Reports. In 2024, the Department issued its first Na-
tional Defense Industrial Strategy and corresponding implementa-
tion plan. Together, these documents provide a roadmap for the De-
partment’s efforts to mitigate industrial base risks. However, the
extent to which the Department is implementing this strategy is
unclear.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct a review of the Department’s current ef-
forts to mitigate risks to the defense industrial base. This review
should examine: (1) The Department’s actions to implement the
National Defense Industrial Strategy, including steps taken to link
the strategy to other efforts across the Department; (2) The status
of the Department’s effort to provide resources for planned and on-
going risk mitigation activities; (3) The Department’s progress in
mitigating industrial base risks; and (4) Any other information the
Comptroller General determines appropriate with respect to de-
fense industrial base risk mitigation. The committee directs the
Comptroller General to provide a briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than June 1, 2026, with a report to fol-
low at a date agreed upon at the time.
Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene supply chain
The committee remains strongly supportive of the establishment
of the Joint Energetics Transition Office, mandated by the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–
31), and of the requirement for the Department of Defense to de-
velop a strategic plan and investment plan for incorporating novel
energetic materials into new and existing programs. The unaccept-
able delays in creating the office are preventing the Department of
Defense from identifying shortfalls in the supply chain for energetic
materials and developing plans to alleviate these issues. For exam-
ple, the committee understands that the supply chain of hydroxyl-
terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) is very fragile and relies on one
single production facility in the United States. HTPB is the pri-
mary binder that holds fuel together in solid rocket motors. With-
out it, the United States cannot adequately produce solid rocket
motors without relying on foreign sources. The committee also un-
derstands that enhanced derivatives of HTPB offer improved per-
formance characteristics, including increased energy output, sta-
bility, and manufacturability, which are essential for maintaining
technological superiority in propulsion and energetics over our ad-
versaries.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2026, on: (1)
An assessment of the current shortfalls in domestic HTPB produc-
tion capacity and supply chain risks associated with HTPB produc-
tion; (2) A summary of ongoing and planned efforts to enhance do-
mestic manufacturing and innovation in HTPB-related tech-

manufacturability; and (3) Opportunities to enter into contracts,
grants, or cooperative agreements with domestic manufacturers to
sustain and expand production capacity of both traditional and en-
hanced HTPB.
Organic industrial base governance
The committee understands the critical importance of the organic
industrial base to ensuring the Nation has the supply of critical
munitions it requires to deter, and, if necessary, fight and win our
Nation’s wars. The committee commends the Army’s recent efforts
to modernize the organic industrial base but remains aware of mul-
tiple deficiencies within the organic industrial base. Many of these
facilities are now sustaining obsolete platforms or being forced to
find alternate commercial work, in part because there is no coher-
ent, centralized plan to guide their workload and modernization ef-
forts. The organic industrial base’s governance is fractured across
multiple commands and functions, including the Army Materiel
Command who owns and operates the facilities and the Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology
(ASA(ALT)) who funds the majority of workload and acquisition
priorities. Further, the use of the Army Working Capital Fund pre-
vents the kind of sustained investment that is required to properly
modernize the organic industrial base. To that end, the committee
recognizes that the Army requires an effective, efficient governance
and resourcing model to ensure the organic industrial base is mod-
ernized and expanded to meet our Nation’s military requirements.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, with the following information: (1) An analysis of the Army
Working Capital Fund’s impact on the operating and production
costs for each facility, with a focus on government-owned, govern-
ment-operated facilities; (2) A cost-benefit analysis of moving away
from the Army Working Capital Fund model and instead utilizing
direct appropriations, or a hybrid approach; (3) A breakout by rel-
evant budget accounts of workload at each organic industrial base
facility; (4) An analysis and explanation of how the Army ensures
the workloads for each site are in line with broader Army produc-
tion and maintenance goals, including an assessment of the feasi-
bility of establishing an annual workload plan that integrates input
from each of the program executive offices; (5) The advisability of
implementing the recommendation from the Army Science Board’s
September 2023 report, ‘‘Surge Capacity in the Defense Munitions
Industrial Base,’’ which said that, ‘‘A single authority for munitions
be assigned, reporting to the ASA(ALT), to assist in the Single
Manager for Conventional Ammunition role and to oversee and ad-
vise on capital investments, Science and Technology investments,
and new manufacturing advances’’; (6) An explanation of how the
integration of Joint Munitions Command into Army Sustainment
Command will impact organic industrial base governance; and (7)
An explanation of how the Joint Energetics Transition Office will
interact with the organic industrial base.

Predictive manufacturing analytics at Army depots
The committee applauds the military departments for their ef-
forts to modernize the organic industrial base and encourages the
military departments to continue collaborating with the Nation’s
digital manufacturing institute on this endeavor. The committee
urges the continued implementation of industrial control networks
across our Army’s arsenals, depots, and plants to enable the collec-
tion, aggregation, and analysis of data associated with the manu-
facture and repair of equipment and supplies. This investment is
a foundational element to achieve digital transformation of the
Army’s organic industrial base and prepare these government-
owned industrial facilities for wartime production and support.
Rapid hull production of unmanned vessels
The committee recognizes that investing in additive manufac-
turing approaches, such as large format polymer additive manufac-
turing, could enable production of unmanned systems at scale.
Such flexible approaches could enable a single machine to fabricate
hull structures for multiple different missions in days versus
months, supporting the proliferation of low-cost, expendable, or
attritable platforms compared to traditional manufacturing meth-
ods. These capabilities align innovation and modernization efforts,
addressing demands for rapid, scalable production in contested en-
vironments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.
The committee further encourages the Department of Defense to
look for opportunities to transition proven research in robotic ad-
vanced manufacturing to the defense industrial base in order to re-
duce production time and costs, enhance workforce efficiency, and
strengthen overall domestic manufacturing capacity. The com-
mittee also believes such efforts can radically increase operational
effectiveness of maintenance activities under contested logistics
scenarios by pushing such activities closer to the forward edges of
conflict, rather than at the end of long and untenable logistics sup-
ply lines within the continental United States.
The committee encourages the Department to invest in and im-
plement relevant advanced manufacturing capabilities such as
large-format polymer additive manufacturing within the defense in-
dustrial base. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 1, 2026, regarding the Department’s plans to in-
corporate additive manufacturing methods, techniques, and proc-
esses for production and manufacturing of unmanned vessels.
Report on addressing acquisition and merger review short-
falls
The committee is concerned that the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy (ASD IBP) does not
have adequate resourcing or personnel to monitor mergers and ac-

report should include but not be limited to: (1) The actions the ASD
IBP will take to ensure the office is adequately staffed to review
all mergers and acquisitions associated with all major defense sup-
pliers, including any required resources necessary to do so; and (2)
How it will monitor and mitigate the risks associated with those
transactions, including any required resources to do so.
Review of reporting requirements
The committee understands that statutory reporting require-
ments, while valuable at the time, may ultimately become less val-
uable over time.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2026, a one-
time list of statutory reporting requirements with no sunset date
which the Secretary determines provide little or no value for con-
sideration of termination.
Review of sole source awards in cloud computing con-
tracting
The committee is concerned that as the Department of Defense
(DOD) increasingly transitions to commercial cloud computing en-
vironments for critical data processing and networking infrastruc-
ture, it is becoming more dependent on a small number of pro-
viders. Continuing challenges in processes and protocols to effec-
tively operate across single cloud infrastructures and manage
multi-cloud environments exacerbate this concentration. The com-
mittee believes this convergence introduces risks of technological
stove-piping, reduction of competition, and balkanization within
DOD networks. However, the committee also recognizes that such
impressions may also be based more on anecdotal observation rath-
er than any firm analysis of Department-wide data and docu-
mented behavior.
Therefore, the committee directs the DOD Inspector General to
conduct a review of the instances of sole source awards within the
cloud computing contracting sphere and to provide a briefing on the
results of this review to the congressional defense committees, not
later than June 1, 2026. Such review should examine the sole
source task orders awarded by the DOD heads of contracting over
the past 3 years to determine if there are any discernible trends
and to compare such trends against similar sole source awards for
other types of contracting. This review should also examine the sole
source justifications and approval and market research documents
to determine their thoroughness. Finally, the review should make
some assessment if the trends identified in the review point to any
systemic concerns regarding competition and make recommenda-
tions regarding means to mitigate any concerns identified.
Silica fabric manufacturing
The committee acknowledges the critical importance of safe-
guarding shipbuilding and repair operations from fire and extreme
heat. These operations demand robust protection not only for costly
equipment and shipyard infrastructure but also for the workforce

engaged in high-risk activities such as welding, cutting, and grind-
ing. As domestic defense manufacturing has expanded, the demand
for advanced thermal protection materials, including silica fabric,
has increased significantly.
The committee is concerned that the domestic industrial base for
silica fabric is limited, with only two U.S. producers of silica fabric
and one domestic supplier of the requisite fiberglass yarn. This con-
strained supply chain poses potential risks to national defense
readiness. The committee is also concerned that the Department of
Defense continues to choose to place orders of silica fabric products
made in China instead of the United States; since February of 2025
the Department of the Navy chose to award Chinese-based manu-
facturers over U.S. manufacturers for delivery of carbon silica fab-
ric. To address this vulnerability, the committee urges the Depart-
ment of Defense to invest in U.S.-made silica fabric, to prioritize
investment in downstream requirements for silica fabric, and to
bolster the existing domestic production capacity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Industrial Base Policy to deliver a briefing to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than March 1, 2026. The
briefing shall address the following: (1) Current efforts to procure
silica-based fabrics for defense applications; (2) The rationale for
choosing Chinese-made silica fabric over U.S.-made silica fabric; (3)
Challenges encountered in securing silica-based fabrics; and (4)
Strategic plans to invest in and strengthen the silica fabric indus-
trial base in the United States to mitigate identified challenges.
Small Business Innovation Research to support organic in-
dustrial base
The committee is aware that the Army’s Small Business Innova-
tion Research (SBIR) program partnered with Letterkenny Army
Depot to develop open topic solicitations for mobile sustainment
tools, shop tools and enablers, and to reverse engineer equipment
to help address these priority areas of the organic industrial base.
While SBIR is primarily used for emerging technology, there are
significant opportunities to use SBIR to tailor emerging technology
with sustainment requirements to better support depots across the
enterprise. The committee encourages all of the military services to
facilitate integration of innovative solutions by conducting SBIR
topics to meet manufacturing process improvement needs.
Small business support for Cybersecurity Maturity Model
Certification requirements
The committee acknowledges the critical importance of safe-
guarding Department of Defense (DOD) sensitive information while
ensuring small businesses can continue to participate in the de-
fense industrial base. The committee recognizes that the Cyberse-
curity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program, while nec-
essary for national security, presents potential significant financial
and technical challenges for small businesses. The committee notes
that assessments conducted by Certified Third-Party Assessment
Organizations are estimated to cost between $45,000 and $100,000
depending on the size and scope of a business. While the policy al-
lows for small businesses to continue to self-certify without requir-

ing third-party assessment, there still exists some barrier to entry
for small contractors to comply. The committee believes this cost
burden has the potential to restrict competition and limit DOD ac-
cess to innovative solutions from non-traditional vendors if the De-
partment does not take sufficient action to help support and men-
tor such providers through this process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Department of Defense
Chief Information Officer, in coordination with the Director for the
Department of Defense Office of Small Business Programs, to pro-
vide the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives a report on a comprehensive small busi-
ness cybersecurity support strategy, not later than January 31,
2026. Such a strategy should support the implementation of the
CMMC program to balance security requirements with accessibility
and affordability.
Under this strategy, the committee encourages the Department
of Defense to pursue innovative approaches to reduce compliance
costs, including shared assessment resources, tiered evaluation
pathways based on contract sensitivity, and alignment with exist-
ing cybersecurity frameworks such as the National Institute of
Standards and Technology Special Publication 800–171, as re-
quired by section 1712 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263). The
strategy should also include practical, shareable resources for small
businesses, such as user-friendly self-assessment tools that provide
clear, actionable guidance for small businesses preparing for
CMMC certification and mentoring support through existing pro-
grams such as the APEX Accelerators or the DOD Mentor-Prote´ge´
Program. The committee also believes this implementation process
should evaluate the option of creating a grace period for small busi-
nesses to complete CMMC requirements after their contract award,
provided they demonstrate a good-faith effort toward compliance,
as well as the potential to make such costs allowable contract costs
for small businesses.
Streamline authorities to establish Navy rapid capabilities
office
The committee commends the Army and the Air Force for estab-
lishing rapid capabilities offices to quickly deliver novel capabilities
to the warfighter at speed and scale. The committee also notes that
section 215 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) established a Naval Air Warfare
Rapid Capabilities Office. However, the committee is concerned
that the Navy has not fully implemented and utilized this office.
The committee also believes that the Navy should seek to estab-
lish similar rapid capability offices for the surface and undersea do-
mains, among other strategic capability priorities for the Navy and
Joint Force. The committee is encouraged by the Navy’s initial ef-
forts but remains concerned about the pace and broader implemen-
tation of these initiatives across the Service. Therefore, the com-
mittee directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide a report, not
later than March 1, 2026, on the following:

(1) The status of establishing the Naval Air Warfare Rapid
Capabilities Office, including the strategic priorities, organiza-
tional structure, and manpower of the office;
(2) A list of capabilities delivered by the office and plans for
the iterative development and fielding of future capabilities in-
cluding any use of agile acquisition approaches so far by the
office;
(3) A comprehensive plan for establishing similar rapid capa-
bility-like offices at the Service-wide level to facilitate the rapid
and iterative development and deployment of surface and un-
dersea capabilities. This plan should include and consider:
a. How to optimize and integrate relevant existing Navy
organizations, such as Project Overmatch, NavalX, and
other similar initiatives, into a rapid capabilities office to
eliminate redundancy and streamline rapid acquisition
workflows across the Navy;
b. A framework to advance collaboration with program
executive officers, the Defense Innovation Unit, and other
Department of Defense innovation hubs to ensure fielding
of accelerated capabilities into the Navy’s acquisition eco-
system; and
c. An assessment of the potential benefits and risks asso-
ciated with such an office, including potential impacts on
ongoing programs and statutory authorities; and
(4) Any additional information the Secretary of the Navy
finds appropriate, including recommendations for changes to
statute that would support the effective operation of a rapid ca-
pabilities office.
The report shall be unclassified but may have a classified annex
if necessary.
Study on contracting official workload
The committee recognizes the critical role of the Department of
Defense (DOD) acquisition workforce in supporting the National
Defense Strategy by ensuring timely, effective, and efficient pro-
curement of capabilities for the warfighter. The committee ac-
knowledges the complexity of DOD contracting processes and the
need for the workforce to meet evolving demands while maintain-
ing accountability and fairness in the use of taxpayer dollars.
The committee notes that the DOD cut its civilian acquisition
workforce nearly in half between 1989 and 1999, as the Govern-
ment Accountability Office (GAO) published in a report on April 26,
2002, titled ‘‘Acquisition Workforce: Department of Defense’s Plans
to Address Workforce Size and Structure Challenges’’ (GAO–02–
630). The DOD further decreased the military and civilian acquisi-
tion workforce 15 percent between 1998 and 2008, to 126,000 total
personnel, as the GAO published in an August 15, 2019, report ti-
tled ‘‘Defense Acquisition Workforce: DOD Increased Use of Human
Capital Flexibilities but Could Improve Monitoring’’ (GAO–19–509),
during a time when contract obligations more than doubled in con-
stant dollars. While the acquisition workforce has increased to
roughly 180,000, the committee is concerned that the acquisition
workforce in general, and the contracting workforce specifically,
has not kept pace with the workload they are assigned.

To better understand the contracting workforce and the processes
they follow, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment to commission a one-time study on
the DOD contracting workforce, to be delivered to the congressional
defense committees, not later than March 1, 2026. The report
should provide an analysis of contracting processes and opportuni-
ties for improvement. Additionally, the report should include: (1)
An assessment of the historical workload for the DOD contracting
official, including the average dollar value and number of contract
actions per contracting official; (2) An assessment of the years of
age and years of service within the contracting workforce by role
and warrant levels; (3) An examination of the steps DOD con-
tracting officials take to award different types of contracts, includ-
ing large, complex contracts and smaller, modular contracts with
performance-based statements of work; (4) An identification of ex-
ternal dependencies that impact contract award timelines and an
evaluation of the potential to convert sequential contracting tasks
into parallel processes by enhancing stakeholder collaboration, in-
cluding recommendations for implementation; (5) A comparison
with commercial industry practices, including benchmarks for how
industry contracting officers measure success, efficiency, and proc-
ess effectiveness; and (6) Recommendations for the DOD about the
size of the contracting officer community and metrics to measure
the workload and productivity of contracting officers.

TITLE IX—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Subtitle A—Office of the Secretary of Defense and Related
Matters
Sec. 901—Economic Defense Unit
The committee recommends a provision that would establish an
Economic Defense Unit (EDU) to centralize requirements genera-
tion, programming, planning coordination, and execution oversight
of economic competition activities at the Department of Defense
(DOD). The EDU would report directly to the Deputy Secretary of
Defense and act as the Principal Staff Assistant to the Secretary
of Defense on all matters related to economic competition. The pro-
vision would amend other authorities to make the EDU co-chair
the National Security Capital Forum and chair the National De-
fense Economic Competition Research Council.
The committee strongly believes that enhanced coordination in
the economic competition space can drastically improve the ability
of the DOD to counter adversary defense industrial base activities,
counter adversary mobilization activities, and secure access, bas-
ing, and overflight opportunities for the U.S. military. The Depart-
ment possesses a significant number of programs and authorities
in this space, which, while individually impressive, are rarely co-
ordinated to requirements or harmonized into campaign plans with
layered effects. A non-exhaustive list of relevant entities involved
in economic competition at the Department of Defense includes the
Office of Strategic Capital, U.S. Special Operations Command, and
numerous organizations within the offices of the Secretary of the
Air Force, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Security, and
the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment. Further,
dozens of innovative U.S. commercial entities are actively working
in this space and can bring significant capability to bear with little
to no taxpayer funding. Additionally, the DOD currently does a
poor job informing the U.S. interagency of its activities in this
space or sharing intelligence with the U.S. interagency for potential
prosecution of targets using non-DOD authorities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Deputy Secretary of De-
fense to brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than
January 15, 2026, on a plan to implement the Economic Defense
Unit.
Sec. 902—Additional authorities for Office of Strategic Cap-
ital
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 149 of title 10, United States Code, and authorize the Office
of Strategic Capital (OSC) to collect fees for the costs of services
(175)

provided by the Office and associated with administering OSC loan
programs, including for project-specific transaction costs and direct
costs relating to such services. Further, this provision would re-
quire the Director of the OSC to provide an annual report on how
those fees were allocated. The provision also would require an
audit by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense at
least once every 2 years.
Sec. 903—Modifications to responsibilities of Director for
Operational Test and Evaluation
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 139(b) of title 10, United States Code, to require the Director
for Operational Test and Evaluation to maintain, on behalf of the
Secretary of Defense, certain enabling and cross-cutting activities
that support operational test and evaluation across the Department
of Defense.
Sec. 904—Directive authority for matters for which Under
Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has
responsibility
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 133a(b) of title 10, United States Code, by granting directive
authority for research and development matters to the Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Research and Engineering.
The committee notes that before the split of the Under Secretary
of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) into
two separate organizations, the Under Secretary of Defense for
AT&L had specific authorities to be able to weigh in, and if nec-
essary, halt the services’ research and development efforts if they
were not realizing the original goals set forth by the Office of the
Secretary of Defense. Under the current statute, section 133a of
title 10, United States Code, only the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment has such authority. This provision
would provide the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and
Engineering with a similar authority and bring parity between the
two organizations.
Sec. 905—Modification of energetic materials strategic plan
and investment strategy of Joint Energetics Transition
Office
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 148(c)(1) of title 10, United States Code, to add a new element
for the energetic materials strategic plan and investment strategy
of the Joint Energetics Transition Office to identify raw material
waste produced during the explosives manufacturing process and to
develop plans to reduce waste and optimize production.
Sec. 906—Limitation on availability of funds pending estab-
lishment of Joint Energetics Transition Office
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of not more than 90 percent of Operation and
Maintenance, Defense-wide funds authorized to be appropriated or
otherwise made available for fiscal year 2026 for travel expenses
for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and

Research and Engineering until the Secretary of Defense notifies
the congressional defense committees that the Department of De-
fense has established the Joint Energetics Transition Office as re-
quired by section 148 of title 10, United States Code, and provides
that Office with the staff and resources necessary to carry out its
responsibilities.
Sec. 907—Modification of covered technology categories for
Office of Strategic Capital
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 149 of title 10, United States Code, to add nuclear fission and
fusion energy, and associated infrastructure, including advanced
nuclear reactors, to the list of covered technologies eligible for sup-
port by the Office of Strategic Capital.
Sec. 908—Modification of organization and authorities of As-
sistant Secretaries of Defense with duties relating to in-
dustrial base policy and readiness
The committee recommends a provision that would create a new
Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Armaments Co-
operation, eliminate the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readi-
ness, and rename the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy,
Plans, and Capabilities as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Strategy, Plans, Capabilities, and Readiness.
Subtitle B—Other Department of Defense Organization and
Management Matters
Sec. 911—Modifications to Joint Requirements Oversight
Council
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 181 of title 10, United States Code, by modifying the respon-
sibilities of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and make
conforming amendments.
Sec. 912—Transfer of responsibility for countering small un-
manned aircraft systems
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 133b(b)(5) of title 10, United States Code, to transfer the re-
sponsibility for Countering small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C–
sUAS) from the Department of the Army to the Under Secretary
of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.
The committee notes that this change highlights the committee’s
continued emphasis on the importance of the C–sUAS program and
puts the management and synchronization responsibility at the ap-
propriate level in the Department of Defense.
Sec. 913—Study on feasibility and advisability of estab-
lishing a Joint Capabilities and Programming Board
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a study on the feasibility and ad-
visability of establishing a Joint Capabilities and Programming
Board within the Department of Defense to enhance joint military

capability prioritization and program budgeting. The study would
evaluate the Board’s proposed structure, including its co-chair lead-
ership by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation
and the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council; its
membership, including the military services and acquisition execu-
tives; its decision-making processes, which would include dis-
senting opinions; and its dedicated staff support. The study would
also assess integrating the Board with existing Department of De-
fense entities, as well as implementation challenges and potential
benefits versus drawbacks. The Secretary of Defense would be re-
quired to submit a report on the contents of the study to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than July 1, 2026.
Sec. 914—Briefing on restructuring of Army Futures Com-
mand and Training and Doctrine Command
The committee directs the Secretary of Army to provide a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, prior to the expenditure of the funds authorized
to be appropriated to restructure commands, on its proposed plan
to combine Army Futures and Training and Doctrine Commands.
Sec. 915—Designation of senior official for military-to-civil-
ian transition
The committee recommends a provision that would designate a
senior official responsible for overseeing servicemember transition
from active duty to civilian life or reserve components.
Sec. 916—Removal of members of Joint Chiefs of Staff
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 151 of title 10, United States Code, to require the President
to notify Congress of the removal of a member of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff from office or transfer to another position or location before
the end of the member’s term of office not later than 5 days after
the removal or transfer takes place.
Sec. 917—Longer term and eligibility for appointment to
rank of Admiral of Commander of Naval Sea Systems
Command
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 526 of title 10, United States Code, to establish an 8-year term
for the Commander of Naval Sea Systems Command and authorize
eligibility for appointment to the rank of Admiral during the final
3 years of that term. The provision would also require a report
from the Secretary of the Navy on options and incentives to pro-
mote private investment in new shipyard capacity on the Pacific
Coast.
Sec. 918—Delay of disestablishment of Navy Expeditionary
Combat Command Pacific
The committee recommends a provision that would provide a 1-
year delay in execution of any Navy plans to disestablish the Navy
Expeditionary Combat Command Pacific.

Sec. 919—Limitation on use of funds for consolidation, dis-
establishment, or elimination of geographic combatant
commands
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the
availability of funds to consolidate, disestablish, or otherwise elimi-
nate a geographic combatant command of the Department of De-
fense until not earlier than 90 days after the Secretary of Defense
submits an analysis to the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 920—Elimination of statutory provisions relating to di-
versity, equity, and inclusion in the Department of De-
fense
The committee recommends a provision that would strike various
statutory requirements and other provisions in United States Code
related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Sec. 921—Defense Science Board study on optimal organiza-
tional structure for digital engineering solutions
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to require the Defense Science Board to con-
duct a comprehensive study on the optimal organizational struc-
ture within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to support digital
solutions engineering activities.
Sec. 922—Establishment of Advanced Nuclear Transition
Working Group
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to establish an Advanced Nuclear Transition
Working Group that would identify critical energy requirements
that may be addressed with advanced nuclear reactors and develop
and execute a strategy to acquire them.
Items of Special Interest
Civilian oversight and advocacy for special operations
forces
The committee remains strongly supportive of the ‘‘service sec-
retary-like’’ role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special
Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict for oversight of and advo-
cacy for special operations forces (SOF). The joint posture state-
ment submitted to the committee by the Assistant Secretary and
the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM),
states, ‘‘The success of SOF is strengthened by the close civilian-
military partnership between [the Assistant Secretary] and the
Commander, [SOCOM]. Our partnership strengthens America’s
warfighting edge for the Joint Force. In its service secretary-like
role, [the Assistant Secretary] is a force-multiplier for SOF’s readi-
ness, fiscal responsibility, and sustainability . . . [Special Oper-
ations and Low-Intensity Conflict] requires the requisite tools,
workforce, and resources to accelerate the implementation of these
priorities and enable SOF to be the most effective, disciplined, and
strategically relevant force it can be.’’
The committee believes the workforce and resources allocated to
the Assistant Secretary in recent years, as mandated by section

922 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017
(Public Law 114–328) and subsequent reforms, have played a crit-
ical role in enabling the operational success and transformation of
SOF to meet current and future challenges without adding bu-
reaucracy. The committee urges the Department of Defense to suf-
ficiently staff and resource the Office of the Assistant Secretary to
meet his or her responsibilities under section 138(b)(2)(A) of title
10, United States Code, including through the establishment of a
permanent Senior Enlisted Advisor and the allocation of additional
military personnel to ensure operational perspectives are appro-
priately represented.
Furthermore, the committee encourages the Secretary of Defense
to expeditiously complete the actions required by section 907 of the
Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) to en-
able the further institutionalization of the Assistant Secretary. The
committee directs the Secretary, not later than October 1, 2025,
and quarterly thereafter, to provide the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives with up-
date briefings on each line of effort established under section 907
of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–
159) until each such activity is completed.

Sec. 1001—General transfer authority
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $6.0 billion of fiscal year
2026 funds authorized in division A of this Act to unforeseen high-
er priority needs in accordance with normal reprogramming proce-
dures. Transfers of funds between military personnel authoriza-
tions would not be counted toward the dollar limitation in this pro-
vision.
Sec. 1002—Amendments and repeals to budgetary require-
ments for defense acquisition
The committee recommends a provision that would repeal certain
budgetary requirements for Department of Defense acquisition pro-
grams. The provision amends requirements for budget displays
from the following: section 141 of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111–84) for body armor
procurement; section 2284 of title 10, United States Code, for the
Explosive Ordnance Disposal Defense Program; section 219 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public
Law 113–66) for the Distributed Common Ground System; section
213 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-
cal Year 2011 (Public Law 111–383) for the Joint Light Tactical Ve-
hicle; and sections 111, 214, and 1502 of the Duncan Hunter Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law
110–417) for Future Combat Systems, Sky Warrior Unmanned Aer-
ial Systems, and Afghanistan and Iraq operations, respectively.
Sec. 1003—Briefing on beginning balance issues for audit
purposes
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to deliver a one-time
briefing to the congressional defense committees on any anticipated
issues in establishing beginning balances for audits of the financial
statements of the Department of Defense. The briefing, due not
later than March 1, 2026, should include: (1) An identification of
each budgetary account expected to have unsupported beginning
balances; (2) A description of the issues preventing beginning bal-
ances from being established for each account; (3) An explanation
of whether beginning balances could be established through gen-
erally accepted accounting principles and, if not, the other methods
that could be used to resolve the issues; and (4) The projected im-
pact to receiving an unmodified audit opinion of that account with-
out a supported beginning balance.

Sec. 1004—Defense Business Audit Remediation Plan report-
ing
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 240g(b) of title 10, United States Code, to eliminate the semi-
annual briefing requirement and to bring the annual reporting date
in line with the due date of the audited financial statements out-
lined in section 240a of title 10, United States Code.
Subtitle B—Naval Vessels
Sec. 1011—Requirements related to Medium Landing Ships
and Light Replenishment Oilers
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Navy, in implementing the Medium Landing Ship and Light Re-
plenishment Oiler programs, to utilize a Vessel Construction Man-
ager (VCM) acquisition strategy, employing commercial design
standards, construction practices, and an external entity to con-
tract for construction. This approach aims to maximize cost effi-
ciency and leverage proven commercial construction methodologies
for non-warship naval vessels.
The VCM acquisition strategy, as demonstrated by the Maritime
Administration’s National Security Multi-Mission Vessels (NSMV)
program, has yielded significant cost savings and operational effi-
ciencies. The NSMV, built using commercial design and contracting
processes, has achieved a cost of approximately $300.0 million per
ship, compared to an estimated $750.0 million to $900.0 million per
ship, if the Navy were to use traditional Navy shipbuilding require-
ments and Department of Defense contracting processes. By uti-
lizing off-the-shelf commercial technology and streamlined con-
tracting using a third-party entity, the VCM approach reduces bu-
reaucratic overhead, accelerates delivery schedules, and ensures
vessels meet mission requirements without the cost premiums as-
sociated with military-specific standards, making it particularly
suitable for naval logistics and support vessels that do not include
complex weapon systems.
The committee recognizes the potential for broader application of
the VCM strategy to enhance the outcomes in the Navy’s ship-
building portfolio. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of
the Navy to submit a briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 31, 2026, identifying additional vessel
classes, such as hospital ships, cable layers, and logistic supply
ships, that could benefit from the VCM acquisition strategy. The
report shall include recommendations for integrating VCM into fu-
ture procurement plans and strategies to overcome any institu-
tional barriers to adopting commercial practices.
Sec. 1012—Modification of authority to purchase used ves-
sels under the National Defense Sealift Fund
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2218 of title 10, United States Code, to raise the limitation on
the procurement of used sealift vessels from 10 vessels to 12.

Sec. 1013—Exemption of unmanned surface vessels and un-
manned underwater vehicles from certain technical au-
thority requirements
The committee recommends a provision that would exempt un-
manned surface vessels and unmanned underwater vehicles from
the Senior Technical Authority requirement under section 8669b of
title 10, United States Code, and limit certain technical require-
ments from the Chief Engineer of the Naval Sea Systems Com-
mand without prior approval of the program manager.
Sec. 1014—Prohibition on retiring and decommissioning
oceanographic research vessels of the Navy
The committee recommends a provision that would prevent the
Navy from retiring or decommissioning any of its oceanographic re-
search vessels until the Navy has received the delivery of a suit-
able replacement research vessel to take the place of any such ves-
sels to be retired.
The Navy’s requirement for oceanographic research vessels is six
ships, matching the current inventory. The committee understands
that the Navy may be considering retiring or decommissioning of
one or more of these vessels before any replacement vessels are
available.
The committee believes that oceanographic research vessels play
a critical role in advancing scientific understanding. This is par-
ticularly true in the Pacific Ocean, the largest and most complex
body of water on earth. These research vessels facilitate the study
of marine ecosystems, oceanic currents, climate change, marine ge-
ology and geophysics, coastal geohazards, biodiversity, fisheries
science, and much more. Given the strategic significance of the Pa-
cific Ocean, sustained oceanographic research is essential for in-
formed decision-making on international policy and national secu-
rity.
Sec. 1015—Report accompanying requests for new flights or
blocks of major shipbuilding programs
The committee recommends a provision that would amend chap-
ter 863 of title 10, United States Code, by adding section 8669d,
which requires the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
Congress alongside any budget request for a new flight or block of
ships under a major shipbuilding program. The report would in-
clude: (1) The results of a production readiness review detailing de-
sign completion, changes from prior authorizations, and associated
risks; (2) A certification that the review supports construction; (3)
Assessments of shipyard readiness, delivery timelines, risk man-
agement processes, and metrics; and (4) Plans for overseeing the
first ship’s construction to ensure design supports the schedule.
Sec. 1016—Report on auxiliary vessel co-production
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army, in consulta-
tion with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of
State, to provide a report on the feasibility, plans, and barriers of

nations.
Sec. 1017—Report on vessel leasing program
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to report on the extent to which the use of
vessels secured under a long-term leasing program could help meet
the Navy’s needs.
Sec. 1018—Pilot program on use of automated shipbuilding
technologies and capabilities
The committee recommends a provision that would establish a
pilot program to identify novel automated hull assembly tech-
nologies for demonstration on at least one shipbuilding program
and require the Secretary of the Navy to provide an annual report
until the pilot program finishes.
Subtitle C—Counterterrorism
Sec. 1021—Extension of prohibition on use of funds for
transfer or release of individuals detained at United
States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the
United States
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1033 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 1041 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend through December 31, 2026,
the prohibition on the use of funds provided to the Department of
Defense to transfer or release individuals detained at United States
Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States. The
provision would also clarify the detainees this section would apply
to by modifying the applicable date when detainees were required
to be held.
Sec. 1022—Extension of prohibition on use of funds to con-
struct or modify facilities in the United States to house
detainees transferred from United States Naval Station,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1034(a) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 1042 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend through December 31, 2026,
the prohibition on the use of funds provided to the Department of
Defense to construct or modify facilities in the United States to
house detainees transferred from United States Naval Station,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The provision would also make a technical
correction by removing unnecessary language from a citation.

Sec. 1023—Extension of prohibition on use of funds for
transfer or release of individuals detained at United
States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to certain
countries
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1035 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), as most recently
amended by section 1043 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend through December 31, 2026,
the prohibition on the use of funds provided to the Department of
Defense to transfer or release individuals detained at United States
Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to certain countries. The
provision would also direct that the term ‘‘individual detained at
Guantanamo,’’ as defined in section 1034(f)(2) of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92),
applies to this section.
Sec. 1024—Extension of prohibition on use of funds to close
or relinquish control of United States Naval Station,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1036 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2018 (Public Law 115–91), as most recently amended by section
1044 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law

tion on the use of funds provided to the Department of Defense to:
(1) Close or abandon United States Naval Station, Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba; (2) Relinquish control of Guantanamo Bay to the Re-
public of Cuba; or (3) Implement a material modification to the
Treaty between the United States of America and Cuba, signed at
Washington, D.C., on May 29, 1934, which modification would con-
structively close United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.
Sec. 1025—Clarification regarding definition of individual
detained at Guantanamo
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1034(f)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92) to clarify the definition of the term
‘‘individual detained at Guantanamo’’ as defined in that section.
The committee notes the importance of clarity as it pertains to
existing law applicable to detainees held at United States Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay.
Subtitle D—Miscellaneous Authorities and Limitations
Sec. 1031—Prohibition on use of funds to support entertain-
ment projects with ties to the Government of the Peo-

comply, with a demand from the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China or the Chinese Communist Party to censor content
of the project in a material manner to advance the national interest
of the People’s Republic of China.
Sec. 1032—Prohibition on destruction or scrapping of World
War II-era aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Department of Defense from scrapping or destroying any World
War II-era aircraft that remain in the custody of the Air Force.
Sec. 1033—Support for counterdrug activities and activities
to counter transnational organized crime
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 284 of title 10, United States Code, support for counterdrug ac-
tivities and activities to counter transnational organized crime, to
expand the criteria to be included in quarterly reports to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives to include: (1) The agency to which support is pro-
vided; (2) The budget; (3) A description of the arrangements for the
sustainment of the project; (4) A description of the project’s objec-
tive; and (5) Information about support provided in previous fiscal
years. The provision would also change the recipients of reports
under such section to the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1034—Senior leaders of the Department of Defense and
other specified persons: authority to provide protection
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 714 of title 10, United States Code, to require enhanced notifi-
cations to the congressional defense committees when the Secretary
of Defense makes determinations with respect to providing physical
protection and security to former senior officials of the Department
of Defense who face serious and credible threats arising from du-
ties performed while employed by the Department of Defense. The
provision would also require the Secretary to provide written notifi-
cation to former senior officials at least 90 days before terminating
or denying the renewal of physical protection and personal security
or reimbursement for such individuals.
Sec. 1035—Notification of the use of military aircraft for im-
migration enforcement operations
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense, within 7 days of providing military aircraft
to support the Department of Homeland Security immigration en-
forcement operations, to provide a written notification to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives on the type of aircraft, the cost of support provided,
the destination country of the aircraft, reassignment of Department
of Defense personnel to support alien detention operations, and any
facility maintenance or upgrades to support such operations.

tion 723 of title 10, United States Code, to require members of the
Armed Forces, including the National Guard, to visibly display the
name of the armed force, Federal entity, or other organization by
which such individual is employed when supporting civilian law en-
forcement agencies.
Sec. 1037—Prohibition on operation of connected vehicles
designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by per-
sons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdic-
tion of a foreign entity of concern on Department of De-
fense property
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
operation of connected vehicles designed, developed, manufactured,
or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the
jurisdiction of a foreign entity of concern on Department of Defense
property after January 1, 2028. The Secretary of Defense must es-
tablish and publish a list of prohibited connected vehicles by Janu-
ary 1, 2027, and provide a briefing to the congressional defense
committees on an implementation plan by June 1, 2027.
Subtitle E—Studies and Reports
Sec. 1041—Annual report on contract cancellations
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on any cancelled
contracts for the preceding fiscal year, for each of the fiscal years
2027 through 2031, to the congressional defense committees, not
later than 10 days after the President’s budget submission. In the
first report required to be submitted under this provision, the Sec-
retary of Defense should also include reporting on any cancellations
of contracts during fiscal year 2025.
The committee notes the Department of Defense’s efforts to im-
plement the President’s ‘‘Department of Government Efficiency’’
cost efficiency initiative, as directed by Executive Orders 14158 and
14222. The committee commends the Department for its efforts to
find efficiencies through reviews of existing contracts, but notes
that cancelled contracts should be codified through reprogramming
requests or rescission packages that are approved by the Congress.
Furthermore, the committee is disappointed in the lack of detail
provided to date by the Department on the total amount of savings
announced, which does not include any specifics by contract item
line number and are, therefore, unverifiable.
Sec. 1042—Streamlining of total force reporting require-
ments
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tions 115a and 129 of title 10, United States Code, to streamline
and realign total force reporting requirements. Specifically, this
provision would repeal subsection (g) of section 115a to eliminate
redundant reporting requirements on military technicians, as this
data is included in annual budget materials provided by the De-

the civilian personnel report required by section 129(c) of title 10,
United States Code, into the Defense Manpower Profile Report re-
quired by section 115a of title 10, United States Code, to better
align with the annual President’s budget request and to eliminate
duplicative reporting.
Sec. 1043—Report on National Guard sexual assault preven-
tion and response training
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Chief of the National Guard Bureau, in coordination with the Sec-
retary of Defense, to submit a report to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the
number of National Guard members who have received sexual as-
sault prevention and response training in the preceding calendar
year.
Sec. 1044—Reports to Congress on Department of Defense
support for immigration enforcement operations
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on
the Department of Defense’s support to the Department of Home-
land Security’s (DHS) immigration enforcement operations, not
later than 30 calendar days after the Secretary approves a Request
for Assistance from DHS and every 30 calendar days thereafter.
Sec. 1045—Military Sealift Command
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Navy to submit annual reports to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
commencing not later than 180 days after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, on efforts to improve recruitment and retention
of Military Sealift Command mariners.
Sec. 1046—Report on aliens held at installations of Depart-
ment of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to submit to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report con-
taining the number of aliens held at Department of Defense (DOD)
installations and the total cost of detention of aliens at DOD instal-
lations, not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of
this Act and monthly thereafter.
Sec. 1047—Briefing on expenditures or planned expendi-
tures of funds allocated for exploration and develop-
ment of existing Arctic infrastructure
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the combatant com-
mander for IndoPacific Command and Northern Command, to pro-
vide a briefing every 90 days to the congressional defense commit-
tees on a spending plan for Arctic infrastructure. The committee
recognizes the geostrategic importance of the Arctic to both the

gion in to include Alaska, Greenland, and Iceland.
Subtitle F—Other Matters
Sec. 1051—Modification of limitation on assistance in sup-
port of Department of Defense accounting for missing
United States Government personnel
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 408(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code, to increase the max-
imum amount of assistance to foreign nations authorized by section
408 to $15,000,000 per fiscal year.
Sec. 1052—Extension of admission to Guam or the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for certain H–
2B nonimmigrants
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 6(b)(1)(B) of the Joint Resolution titled ‘‘A Joint Resolution to
approve the ’Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of
America’, and for other purposes’’ (48 U.S.C. 1806(b)(1)(B)), ap-
proved March 24, 1976, by extending the deadline for certain non-
immigrant H–2B workers to 2031.
The committee notes that this provision would support the re-
alignment of U.S. forces to Guam by addressing limited workforce
availability on Guam. The committee understands that current
labor market conditions are constrained by recovery from Typhoon
Mawar and that, without this provision, construction costs for the
Department of Defense will increase due to labor shortages as well
as degraded readiness, since construction would also be delayed.
Finally, the committee understands that lead times are crucial to
planning and cost estimates for contractors. Should an additional
extension be necessary, the committee strongly encourages the De-
partment of Defense to begin engagements with the Congress, spe-
cifically the committees of jurisdiction, not less than 3 years before
the authority expires.
Sec. 1053—Prohibiting Secretary of Defense from developing
voting technology or methodology
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of Defense from developing or facilitating any voting
technology or methodology for voting in Federal and state elections.
The committee notes that the Department of Defense (DOD) Fed-
eral Voting Assistance Program has been highly successful in car-
rying out its mission to ensure that all servicemembers are pro-
vided the opportunity to vote in their respective state and local
elections, regardless of where servicemembers are stationed or de-
ployed. The committee notes that the DOD has successfully facili-
tated servicemember overseas voting using all voting methodologies
approved by states and localities and that this success has been
built upon the DOD taking a neutral position with respect to voting
methodology. The committee is concerned that any action taken by
the DOD that endorses, or results in the appearance of endorsing,

any voting methodology over another could undermine the success
of this vital mission. Furthermore, the committee notes that re-
searching and developing technology that supports one type of vot-
ing methodology over another is not a DOD mission.
Sec. 1054—Assessment of the feasibility and advisability of
using personnel of the Department of Defense to sup-
port U.S. Customs and Border Protection
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Home-
land Security, to submit a report to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the
Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee of the Sen-
ate, and the Homeland Security Committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives, within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this
Act, assessing the advisability, feasibility, and cost of using quali-
fied Department of Defense personnel in support of U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, to provide translation and interpretation
services in connection with border security operations.
Sec. 1055—Limitation on availability of funds for travel ex-
penses of the Office of the Secretary of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of 25 percent of the funding authorized
or otherwise made available for the travel expenses of the Office
of the Secretary of Defense until various overdue reports and other
documents are submitted to the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1056—Department of Defense sensitive activities
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to keep the congressional defense committees
fully and currently informed of Department of Defense sensitive ac-
tivities. The provision would also require the Secretary to provide
a notification to the congressional defense committees not later
than 48 hours after the compromise or failure of a Department of
Defense sensitive activity and establish a process for coordinating
and deconflicting contracts that support or enable sensitive activi-
ties with other departments and agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment, as appropriate.
Sec. 1057—Irregular Warfare Exercise Laboratory
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of Defense to establish and maintain an Irregular War-
fare Exercise Laboratory. The laboratory would support the train-
ing, experimentation, preparation, and validation of the Armed
Forces of the United States to conduct full-spectrum irregular war-
fare activities, and it would enable activities to build the capacity
and interoperability of the security forces of friendly foreign coun-
tries.
The committee recognizes the importance of training with part-
ner nations to develop the interoperability of irregular and uncon-
ventional warfare tactics, techniques, and procedures in the face of
an increasingly complex global security environment. The com-
mittee notes that the Ridge Runner irregular warfare exercise

Operations Forces, allies and partners, and other stakeholders to
provide validation for deploying special operations elements in dy-
namic and realistic irregular warfare scenarios. The committee en-
courages the expansion of such activities, as appropriate.
Sec. 1058—Semiannual report on Department of Defense op-
erations at the southern land border
The committee recommends a provision that would require the

Items of Special Interest
Adopting and scaling commercially available extra-large un-
manned underwater vehicles
The committee remains supportive of the Navy’s efforts to inte-
grate large diameter and extra-large unmanned underwater vehi-
cles (UUVs) capable of executing high-value missions in contested
environments. Section 1032 of the Servicemember Quality of Life
Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) requires the Navy, in coordination
with the Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and in consulta-
tion with the Director of the Defense Innovation Unit, to carry out
a competitive demonstration of large and extra-large UUVs
leveraging commercial solutions. The demonstration builds on the
open competition directed by section 862 of the James M. Inhofe
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public
Law 117–263) and held by the Navy and the Defense Innovation
Unit in late 2023. This demonstration culminated in the signing of
three prototype agreements just months later, in early 2024. The
committee is pleased to note that the first large diameter UUV was
delivered to a Navy operational unit for experimentation in late
2024 as a result of the 2023 competition.
The committee is encouraged by the rapid delivery of these capa-
bilities from prototype award to unit experimentation in only 2
years. Therefore, the committee encourages the Secretary of the
Navy to continue leveraging commercial solutions to deliver large
diameter and extra-large UUVs with accompanying support equip-
ment, joint Command and Control software, and sustainment and
support services. The committee recognizes the complementary na-
ture of extra-large UUVs for the submarine industrial base to pro-
vide additional capacity and lethality. The committee also believes
that these vehicles should be capable of integrating a broad array
of payloads and sensors and should be delivered quickly to oper-
ational commands for fleet integration and interoperability develop-
ment, fielding, and operations. Further, the committee believes
that the Secretary of the Navy should expedite fielding of capabili-
ties selected during the 2025 competition to deliver mission-capable
extra-large UUVs for operational testing, user training, and fleet
integration.
Briefing on commercial technology for shipbuilding
The committee acknowledges the importance of the Navy’s ship-
building goals and recognizes shipyards as a critical national secu-
rity asset. The committee is also aware of the need to improve the
output and drive down costs associated with Navy shipbuilding.
The committee notes that in testimony on March 11, 2025, the Act-
ing Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development,

and Acquisition, stated that, for shipbuilding programs, ‘‘On bal-
ance, cost and schedule performance remain poor; deliveries are ap-
proximately 1 to 4 years late, and costs continue to rise faster than
overall inflation.’’
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2026, on the
Navy’s plans to utilize commercially available software to help re-
duce the current shipbuilding backlog.
Briefing on DOD Record Management
The committee affirms its support for the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) report titled ‘‘DOD Law of War Policies: Ac-
tions Needed to Ensure Proper Reporting and Retention of Alleged
Violations’’ (GAO–24–107217), published February 13, 2024. This
report recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) de-
velop and maintain a system to comprehensively retain records of
alleged law of war violations.
Accordingly the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than May 1, 2026, on the status of this recommendation, in-
cluding: (1) A designated lead agency or office within the DOD; and
(2) A plan to ensure that regulations regarding reporting on such
issues remain current and appropriately disseminated within the
DOD.
DDG–51 shipbuilding
The committee supports the Department of the Navy’s efforts to
maintain a robust and capable surface fleet through the DDG–51
Arleigh Burke-class destroyer program, a cornerstone of naval
power. The committee commends the Navy’s progress in sustaining
the industrial base and encourages continued investment to ensure
long-term stability for shipbuilders and suppliers.
However, the committee notes with concern that the Department
of the Navy did not submit the required 30-year shipbuilding plan
with its fiscal year 2026 budget materials, as required by section
231 of title 10, United States Code. This plan is essential for pro-
viding Congress and industry stakeholders with a clear, long-term
vision for naval shipbuilding requirements. The committee urges
the Department of the Navy to promptly fulfill this statutory re-
quirement to enhance transparency and support effective planning.
The committee recognizes congressional intent in the budget rec-
onciliation package, H.R. 1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act), to add a
third destroyer in fiscal year 2027 and fiscal year 2029. This ap-
proach aims to provide a consistent demand signal to the ship-
building industrial base, which has relied on Congress to fund a
third destroyer every other year to maintain a healthy production
backlog. The committee is concerned that the Department of the
Navy’s decision to allocate these funds to subsidize the two fiscal
year 2026 ships, rather than planning for the additional destroyers,
introduces uncertainty for shipbuilders and risks destabilizing the
industrial base. The committee strongly encourages the Depart-
ment of the Navy to prioritize predictable, sustained funding for
the DDG–51 program in its base budget requests, ensuring sta-

bility for the industrial base without dependence on congressional
interventions.
Department of Defense sites for purposes of national secu-
rity reviews
The committee remains concerned that foreign nations, including
the People’s Republic of China, have sought to purchase land near
military installations that have not yet been listed on Appendix A
to 31 Code of Federal Regulations Part 802. As a result of this, the
committee believes that some military installations may not have
been appropriately reviewed for national security concerns.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than Feb-
ruary 1, 2026, regarding which military installations, training
routes, military airspaces, controlled firing areas, and military op-
erations areas he or she deems appropriate for review because of
national security concerns.
Dissemination of civilian legal services (549C) review
The committee finds the Department of Defense (DOD) is incon-
sistently implementing section 549C of the James M. Inhofe Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law
117–263) and the requirement to distribute information on legal
rights to victims of military-connected sexual assault. A review of
how each service is implementing this requirement is necessary to
best protect the victims of military-connected sexual assault and
ensure that section 549C is properly implemented.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Personnel and Readiness, in consultation with the DOD Sexual
Assault Prevention and Response Office, to submit a briefing on
implementation of section 549C to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
March 1, 2026. The briefing should include: (1) An analysis of how
each service is implementing the requirements of 549C, including
any forms that are provided to victims to make them aware of their
rights; (2) Justification for the Department’s reliance on veterans’
services instead of victims’ services, and the viability of providing
victim-centric services; (3) The extent to which the implementation
of the requirements of 549C can be improved and enhanced, to in-
clude consideration of a Department-hosted website; and (4) The vi-
ability and appropriateness of developing uniform standards and
procedures across all the military services for implementing 549C,
including information directly in forms made available to victims or
scripts provided to Military Criminal Investigative Organizations
for agents to read to victims.
Economic considerations in tabletop exercises
The committee believes that the private sector and other depart-
ments and agencies of the Federal Government will play a critical
role in any future conflict, especially involving the People’s Repub-
lic of China. The committee believes these non-Department of De-
fense stakeholders are uniquely positioned to provide insight about
how various contingencies may impact the global and U.S. econo-

mies and how the economic elements of national power may con-
tribute to success in such contingencies.
Therefore, the committee believes that the Secretary of Defense
should invite representatives from U.S. departments and agencies
focused on economic issues, including but not limited to the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, the Department of Commerce, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representa-
tive, the National Economic Council, as well as the private sector
as appropriate, to participate in unclassified Department of De-
fense tabletop exercises for the purposes of: (1) Assessing the eco-
nomic impacts of Department of Defense decisions during crisis and
conflict; and (2) Evaluating the economic tools available to the U.S.
Government to augment Department of Defense capabilities in
competition, crisis, and conflict.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than December 31, 2025, to provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees on the Department’s current and
planned efforts to include representatives from U.S. departments
and agencies focused on economic issues and the private sector in
unclassified Department of Defense tabletop exercises.
The committee notes that the Economic Defense Unit, estab-
lished elsewhere in this Act, should contribute to these efforts.
Government Accountability Office review of costs of sup-
porting civil authorities
The committee notes that since 2002, the Department of Defense
(DOD) has supported the Department of Homeland Security’s
(DHS) requests to secure the Nation’s borders. Over the years, the
DOD has seen an increase in requirements for supporting civil au-
thorities including the deployment of additional active-duty mili-
tary personnel and other assets to the United States-Mexico bor-
der. Published on February 23, 2021, the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) produced a report entitled ‘‘Southwest Border
Security: Actions Are Needed to Address the Cost and Readiness
Implications of Continued DOD Support to U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection’’ (GAO–21–356), which found weaknesses in the
DOD’s estimates of the costs to support DHS activities. Further,
GAO found that the DOD did not track all costs or give Congress
timely information on the full costs the DOD incurred for DHS sup-
port, as it was mandated to do. The committee is interested in en-
suring that it has an accurate assessment of DOD and National
Guard support of operations to the DHS and therefore directs the
Comptroller General of the United States to assess the extent to
which the DOD has tracked the costs, including reimbursement
and reprogramming actions, for its support to the DHS since fiscal
year 2025 and the extent to which the DOD is following statutory
reporting requirements for support to the DHS since fiscal year
2025.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to brief the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 31, 2026, with the results of the review to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.

Increased access to ocean data
The committee notes that improved access to Navy data that no
longer needs to be classified could have wide and far-reaching im-
pacts across ocean interests, including for research related to the
physical and biological properties of the ocean, ocean health, fish-
eries, and ocean exploration.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Secretary of the
Navy, as part of broader Navy efforts to standardize and make
available oceanographic data, to take the steps necessary to ensure
the release of, and public access to, unclassified and declassified
oceanographic data, subject to existing regulatory restrictions.
Irregular warfare
The committee believes irregular warfare is a critical component
of the Department of Defense’s ability to effectively deter and
counter threats across the continuum of competition and conflict.
The committee notes that, in recent years, the Department has re-
leased multiple strategic-level documents, including the 2018 Irreg-
ular Warfare Annex to the National Defense Strategy and the Joint
Concept for Competing, in an attempt to bring greater clarity and
cohesion to its irregular warfare and other asymmetric activities.
Yet, the committee is concerned that the Department’s approach to
institutionalizing irregular warfare as a core component of its plan-
ning and steady-state activities around the world has been ad-hoc
and inhibited by institutional and bureaucratic impediments.
The committee notes that section 1091 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) af-
firmed that the Secretary of Defense has the authority to conduct
irregular warfare operations, including clandestine irregular war-
fare operations, to defend the United States, allies of the United
States, and interests of the United States. The committee believes
the Secretary’s authority includes the conduct of steady-state irreg-
ular warfare military operations short of hostilities in areas outside
of areas of active hostilities, including, but not limited to, oper-
ational preparation of the environment, information operations,
cyber operations, civil-military operations, and building partner ca-
pacity.
The committee directs the Secretary to provide a briefing to the
Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than December 31,
2025, on the Department’s ongoing and planned efforts to institu-
tionalize irregular warfare within the Department. The briefing
should, at a minimum, include the following: (1) A detailed descrip-
tion of the Department’s overarching campaign plan for irregular
warfare operations within and across geographic combatant com-
mand areas of responsibility; (2) A description of the roles and re-
sponsibilities for the planning, resourcing, and conduct of irregular
warfare in the Department; (3) An overview of existing execute or-
ders relevant to the conduct of irregular warfare activities around
the world; and (4) Any other matters deemed relevant by the Sec-
retary.

fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283),
the Department of Defense (DOD) established the Irregular War-
fare Center to serve as the DOD’s Center of Excellence for Irreg-
ular Warfare. The Irregular Warfare Center is responsible for de-
veloping and disseminating irregular warfare knowledge across the
defense enterprise and international community, with particular
emphasis on countering the Chinese Communist Party’s malign ac-
tivities around the world. The committee further notes that the Ir-
regular Warfare Center is partnering with a consortium of institu-
tions of higher education to provide academic research to support
the Center’s efforts relating to irregular warfare.
The committee notes the critical importance of irregular warfare
to the Department’s efforts to create dilemmas, impose costs, and
counter the malign activities of adversaries around the world, par-
ticularly the Chinese Communist Party. The committee further be-
lieves that a dedicated entity within the Department focused on ir-
regular warfare provides military commanders, policy makers, and
foreign partners with valuable insight and support. The committee
encourages the Department to continue efforts to mature the Irreg-
ular Warfare Center and integrate its work into policy-making, pro-
fessional military education, and engagement with foreign partners
and allies.
Large surface combatant briefing
The Navy’s DDG(X) program aims to procure a new class of guid-
ed-missile destroyers to replace the Ticonderoga (CG–47)-class
Aegis cruisers and older Arleigh Burke (DDG–51)-class Aegis de-
stroyers. The Navy plans to procure the first DDG(X) in 2032, with
introduction to the fleet prior to 2040. The DDG(X) class of destroy-
ers is designed to serve through the 2060s.
Given the program’s complexity, the need to avoid past ship-
building errors, and the importance of a robust industrial base, the
committee has taken the following legislative steps to support the
Navy’s efforts:
(1) Section 131 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92) directed the Navy to
conduct a robust land-based testing program to prove out items
designated as critical risks and also the complete propulsion
system in a prototype form, prior to milestone B;
(2) Section 221 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) directed a continued, ro-
bust, and land-based testing program prior to ship delivery to
fully test the propulsion plant in its final form, replicating the
final ship configuration;
(3) Section 130 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) af-
firmed the need for a close collaborative partnership with the
large surface combatant shipyards and the Navy during design
and development of DDG(X); and
(4) Section 820 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) made changes to
multiyear procurement authorities in title 10 to ensure the De-
partment of Defense accounts for the industrial base when
making procurement decisions.

The committee encourages the Department to make timely de-
sign decisions to move forward with the program with a firm set
of requirements that balance warfighter needs and shipbuilder fea-
sibility. To ensure progress, the committee directs the Secretary of
the Navy to provide a briefing on the DDG(X) program to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than January 30, 2026.
The briefing shall include:
(1) The current status of warfighting and technical design re-
quirements;
(2) The plan to ensure sufficient design margin, including
size, weight, power, and cooling (SWAP–C) requirements, for
the program’s 30-year lifespan;
(3) The status of partnerships with large surface combatant
prime contractors, including specific actions to achieve design
improvements and cost savings;
(4) The impacts of accelerating the award of the detail design
and construction contract in fiscal year 2030; and
(5) Any additional relevant information the Secretary finds
pertinent.
Maritime industrial base supplier funding
The committee encourages additional opportunities for capability
expansion within the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB) supply chain
and notes that second- and third-tier submarine industrial base
suppliers are challenged by several factors, including workforce
availability and training, material costs, and production schedule
inconsistencies. The committee further notes that the Supplier De-
velopment Funding program has demonstrated positive results by
increasing production capacity and providing investment for ma-
chinery and equipment within the MIB. The committee is con-
cerned, however, that second- and third-tier suppliers remain chal-
lenged by current economic conditions as they struggle to meet the
build schedule for Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than January 1, 2026, on opportunities for: (1) A capital loan
authority for MIB suppliers; and (2) Private-sector financing op-
tions, including such authorities proposed elsewhere in this bill.
Medium unmanned surface vessel program requirements
and acquisition
The committee strongly supports the Department of the Navy’s
efforts to transition to a hybrid fleet integrating unmanned systems
to enhance operational flexibility and resilience. The committee
commends the Navy’s decision to defer the Large Unmanned Sur-
face Vessel program, with its complex requirements, in favor of
prioritizing the near-term scaling of the Medium Unmanned Sur-
face Vessel (MUSV) program to address urgent operational needs,
including those articulated by the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
However, the committee is concerned that the current MUSV ap-
proach, redesignated as the Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC)
program and centered on converting seven commercial Offshore
Support Vessels for delivery by 2027, does not fully align with the
Navy’s long-term strategic objectives. The committee believes that

200
the MASC program, as structured, may fail to meet critical mission
profiles, requires significant manning and sustainment resources,
and will not yield a scalable design representative of a future
MUSV program of record. This approach risks delaying critical
learning opportunities and hindering the Navy’s ability to field
operationally relevant unmanned systems at scale.
The committee recognizes that multiple industry partners are de-
veloping mature, purpose-built MUSV solutions that leverage ad-
vanced commercial technologies, offering significant advantages in
performance, autonomy, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To cap-
italize on these advancements, the committee strongly recommends
that the Navy revise the MUSV program requirements and adopt
an open, competitive solicitation process, such as a Commercial So-
lutions Opening, in coordination with the Director of the Defense
Innovation Unit. This approach should prioritize near-term, scal-
able solutions that maximize the use of privately financed, commer-
cially derived technologies to accelerate development and deploy-
ment while fostering robust competition.
To ensure alignment with these objectives, the committee directs
the Secretary of the Navy, in coordination with the Commander,
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, to provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than November 1, 2025. The
briefing shall include, at a minimum, the following elements: (1)
An explanation of the updated operational and technical require-
ments for the MUSV program, emphasizing scalability and align-
ment with validated operational needs articulated by the Com-
mander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command; (2) An outline of the Navy’s
acquisition strategy, including the use of an open solicitation proc-
ess to maximize competition and incorporate commercially derived
and privately developed technologies; (3) A plan for rapid proto-
typing, including timelines, milestones, and metrics for evaluating
prototype performance, with a focus on iterative development to ac-
celerate learning and refine designs for scalability; (4) A strategy
for transitioning successful prototypes to a program of record, in-
cluding projected timelines, cost estimates, and plans for integra-
tion into the Navy’s hybrid fleet architecture; and (5) An analysis
of risks associated with the current MASC approach compared to
a purpose-built MUSV solution, including sustainment, manning,
and operational effectiveness considerations.
The committee urges the Navy to prioritize innovative, commer-
cially driven solutions to deliver a scalable MUSV capability that
meets the urgent needs of the fleet while fostering a competitive
industrial base. This approach will ensure the Navy achieves oper-
ational advantages in contested environments and maintains tech-
nological superiority.
Narrative intelligence and cognitive warfare
The committee recognizes that the rapidly evolving global secu-
rity landscape and the increasing sophistication of information-cen-
tric threats pose significant strategic challenges, particularly as
peer and near-peer competitors increasingly prioritize efforts and
investments in this domain of warfare. The committee notes that
the People’s Republic of China, for example, is actively engaged in
developing what it terms ‘‘informatized warfare’’ and

‘‘intelligentized warfare,’’ with a strong emphasis on cognitive do-
main operations, involving the integration of information warfare
across military and civilian sectors and viewing information as a
critical domain for achieving strategic advantage in great power
competition. The committee believes there is an urgent need for a
coherent understanding of and investment in cognitive warfare to
address these challenges.
The committee notes that despite multiple congressional actions,
there remain ambiguities and challenges in core definitions relat-
ing to information warfare, with frequent conflation of terms such
as information warfare, information operations, cyberwarfare, cog-
nitive warfare, and influence operations. The committee believes
this definitional ambiguity contributes to a lack of strategic clarity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a report on cognitive warfare and narrative intelligence to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than March 31, 2026. In this report, the
Secretary of Defense shall define cognitive warfare as it relates to
the Department of Defense and assess how this definition aligns
with or relates to existing doctrinal elements, including information
warfare, psychological operations, and military information support
operations. Additionally, the committee directs the report to in-
clude an assessment of which Department of Defense organizations
contribute to and have functional responsibility for cognitive war-
fare efforts. Finally, the report must include an examination of the
relative value of narrative intelligence, defined as intelligence of
the story or narrative an adversary is attempting to build, to cog-
nitive warfare and related disciplines. The committee expects this
evaluation to consider how narrative intelligence can enhance mili-
tary operations, including information operations and irregular
warfare.
Navy water purification system upgrades
The committee notes that the Navy has been using hazardous
bromine cartridges in smaller surface combatants as the means of
purifying non-potable water, despite the fact that safer, non-haz-
ardous alternatives, such as Mixed-Oxidant Electrolytic Disinfect-
ant Generator equipment, have been successfully deployed on
large-deck ship classes for nearly two decades. Despite this proven
track record, the transition to such technologies on smaller ships
has been stalled.
The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit to the
congressional defense committees a report, not later than March
30, 2026, on the removal of hazardous bromine cartridges currently
used in surface combatants as the means of potable water purifi-
cation. The report should include an explanation and assessment
of: (1) The use of the non-hazardous water purification tech-
nologies; and (2) The timeline for broader implementation of such
technologies as previously directed and funded by the Congress.
Safety Investigation Board report
The committee is very concerned that the Army, Air Force, and
Navy continue to report near record rates of serious Class A flight
mishaps. Congress created the Joint Safety Council in the National

Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–
81), upon the recommendation of the National Commission on Mili-
tary Aviation Safety, to focus on operational safety challenges, as
well as to augment existing safety programs.
The committee also supports the use of both Accident Investiga-
tion Boards and Safety Investigation Boards to identify root causes
of accidents and recommendations for corrective actions to prevent
future accidents, including improved training, maintenance, and
oversight. In order to ensure the key findings and recommenda-
tions of these investigations are addressed and implemented, the
committee directs the Joint Safety Council, in coordination with the
military services, to provide a report to the Senate Armed Services
Committee, not later than April 1, 2026, that contains executive
summaries for Safety Investigation Boards conducted from January
1, 2022, to July 1, 2025, and summaries of any corrective actions
implemented in response to the Board’s findings.
Shipbuilding industrial base cost estimate
The committee recognizes the critical importance of having a ro-
bust shipbuilding industrial base to achieve the Department of the
Navy’s battle force ship inventory goals. In the Senate report ac-
companying S. 4638 (S. Rpt. 118–188) of the Servicemember Qual-
ity of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159), the committee directed
the Secretary of the Navy, in consultation with the Director of Cost
Assessment and Program Evaluation, to deliver an unconstrained
cost estimate of industrial base investments necessary to meet the
inventory plan for conventional surface ships. The committee reit-
erates its directive for the Navy to deliver this report to the con-
gressional defense committees.
The committee emphasizes specific elements of the report to ad-
dress pressing priorities. First, the report should provide a detailed
assessment of strategic outsourcing opportunities for ship modules,
such as steel fabrication, machining, and outfitting workload, to
manufacturers across the nation. This is critical to addressing
workforce shortages in major shipbuilding regions and to enhanc-
ing distributive shipbuilding as a core component of program de-
sign, rather than as a corrective measure to deal with shipbuilding
programs after they develop cost and schedule problems. The sec-
ond element concerns infrastructure investments. The report
should prioritize infrastructure improvements at major shipyards,
including Bath Iron Works, Ingalls Shipbuilding, General Dynam-
ics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, Fincantieri
Marinette Marine, and Austal USA. These improvements should
encompass facilities, equipment, quality of life, and other capital
expenditures to bolster capacity and ensure timely production of
surface combatants and other naval vessels.
Additionally, the committee is interested in evaluating the feasi-
bility of investing in new ship construction or repair yards, includ-
ing those capable of supporting nuclear naval shipbuilding. The
committee understands that the Navy, in collaboration with the Di-
rector of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, is conducting
a study on the potential for such facilities.

203
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
brief the congressional defense committees on the findings of this
study, not later than September 1, 2025, including providing an as-
sessment of whether such investments are advisable to meet future
force structure goals.
Software colors of money
The committee remains interested in ensuring that the Depart-
ment of Defense is postured to procure and operate software pro-
grams in the most effective and efficient manner possible. The com-
mittee notes that the Commission on Planning, Programming,
Budgeting, and Execution Reform recommended, in its March 2024
final report, that the Department revise the Financial Management
Regulation related to funding for software refreshes or upgrades.
The committee is also aware of ongoing efforts in the Budget Activ-
ity 8 initiative.
Therefore, not later than January 1, 2026, the Under Secretary
of Defense (Comptroller) shall submit a report to the congressional
defense committees detailing proposed changes to the Department’s
Financial Management Regulation that would be needed to imple-
ment the Commission’s recommendation #11A to allow procure-
ment; research, development, test, and evaluation; or operation and
maintenance funds to be used for the full cycle of software develop-
ment, prototyping, testing, fielding, revision, and sustainment,
while ensuring full oversight over the totality of software spending
by activity type.
Special operations forces promotions, assignments, and re-
tention
The committee notes that section 167(e)(2)(J) of title 10, United
States Code, states that the Commander, U.S. Special Operations
Command (SOCOM), is responsible for monitoring the promotions
of special operations forces (SOF) and coordinating with the mili-
tary departments on matters related to SOF assignments, reten-
tion, training, professional military education, and special and in-
centive pays. The committee also notes that section 907 of the
Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) re-
quires the Secretary of Defense to establish a process for the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Inten-
sity Conflict to monitor the promotions of members of special oper-
ations forces and to coordinate with the military departments re-
garding the assignment, retention, training, professional military
education, and special and incentive pays of members of special op-
erations forces consistent with the ‘‘service secretary-like’’ respon-
sibilities assigned to the Assistant Secretary.
The committee is concerned about the extent to which the Assist-
ant Secretary and the Commander, SOCOM are exercising their
authority to monitor the promotion opportunities for SOF to meet
staffing requirements and coordinating with the military depart-
ments on the assignment of leaders to special operations, service,
and joint positions. Therefore, the committee directs the Comp-
troller General of the United States to review SOF promotions, as-
signments, and retention by assessing: (1) To what extent the As-

sistant Secretary and the Commander, SOCOM monitor SOF pro-
motions; (2) To what extent the Assistant Secretary and the Com-
mander, SOCOM coordinate with the military departments on SOF
assignments, retention, training, professional military education,
and special and incentive pays; (3) The extent to which the DOD
has processes for assigning SOF officer and enlisted personnel to
key leadership positions within the SOF service components and
other SOF units, service, and joint positions; (4) To what extent the
Assistant Secretary; the Commander, SOCOM; and the military de-
partments have guidance concerning their respective authorities,
roles, and responsibilities to monitor SOF promotions and coordi-
nate on assignments, retention, training, professional military edu-
cation, and special and incentive pays; and (5) Any other related
matters the Comptroller General considers appropriate.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a preliminary briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than De-
cember 31, 2025, and to provide the final results of the review to
these committees on a mutually agreed upon date.
Status of the Department of Defense financial audit
The committee remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving
a clean financial audit opinion for the Department of Defense
(DOD), as mandated by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990
and subsequent legislation. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, the
DOD continues to make incremental progress, with 10 of 28 major
reporting entities receiving unmodified or qualified audit opinions.
However, significant challenges persist, including serious financial
management problems, the inability to adequately account for
intragovernmental activity and balances between Federal entities,
and weaknesses in the process for preparing consolidated financial
statements. These issues, compounded by inadequate controls over
financial data and outdated financial management systems, con-
tinue to hinder the DOD’s ability to achieve a clean audit opinion,
undermining fiscal transparency and accountability in the steward-
ship of taxpayer resources.
Section 1005 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) establishes a deadline of December
31, 2028, for the DOD to achieve an unmodified audit opinion
across all financial statements. To support this deadline, the com-
mittee directs the Secretary of Defense to deliver a report to the
congressional defense committees, not later than February 1, 2026,
detailing implementation of a plan to address deficiencies and meet
the statutory deadline. This plan shall include the following ele-
ments:
(1) A timeline for consolidating DOD data systems for audit
purposes;
(2) Identify and resolve critical material weaknesses in fi-
nancial reporting, internal controls, and systems integration,
as identified in prior audit findings;
(3) Establish robust processes to fully reconcile intergovern-
mental transactions;

(4) Implement standardized procedures to accurately account
for and value all property, plant, and equipment held by third
parties, including contractors and other entities;
(5) Develop and enforce protocols to ensure compliance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Federal Ac-
counting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) standards, and
other established audit requirements;
(6) Ensure all assets, liabilities, and financial transactions
are accurately accounted for and valued in accordance with
federal standards;
(7) Implement processes to fully document, validate, and
support all open obligations, ensuring transparency and
traceability in financial commitments;
(8) Integrate procure-to-pay processes into all appropriate
general ledgers, ensuring seamless tracking of financial trans-
actions from procurement to payment; and
(9) Leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and automation tech-
nologies to enhance audit readiness.
Study on Department of Defense Federal Voting Assistance
Program grant administration and compliance
The committee directs the Comptroller General of the United
States to review activities that the Department of Defense (DOD)
Federal Voting Assistance Program has undertaken to provide as-
sistance to voters and states to facilitate voting for military and
overseas citizens voters. This review should include the DOD’s ef-
forts to administer and oversee grants provided to states and local-
ities under section 6304 of title 31, United States Code, and section
20311 of title 52, United States Code, for the purpose of conducting
one or more pilot programs on new election technology for the ben-
efit of Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act
(UOCAVA) voters. It should also review how the Secretary of De-
fense oversees whether states and localities use those grant funds
in a manner consistent with the grant agreement terms. The re-
view should also include what is known about the use and security
of systems for the electronic delivery, marking, and return of bal-
lots for federal elections for UOCAVA voters.
The committee directs the Comptroller General to provide an in-
terim briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives on this review, not later than
January 12, 2026, with a final product to follow by a date mutually
agreed upon at the time of the briefing.
Study on integration of force management, budgeting, and
requirements processes and combatant commands head-
quarters funding
The committee recognizes the need for greater alignment among
the Department of Defense’s force management, budgeting, and re-
quirements determination processes to enhance efficiency and oper-
ational effectiveness. The committee notes that both the military
services and the combatant commands (COCOMs) face budget con-
straints. The committee also understands that the COCOMs rely
on the military services to develop and acquire capabilities that
allow the COCOMs to execute and sustain their missions.

Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a one-time report to the congressional defense committees, not
later than March 1, 2026, on the feasibility, advisability, benefits,
risks, and potential implementation options for ways to improve
the integration of global force management with resourcing and
programming decisions to enhance cost awareness and strategic
prioritization, to include an evaluation of shifting COCOM head-
quarters budgets from the military services to improve financial
transparency and flexibility while ensuring continued host-service
support.
The committee encourages the Secretary to seek input and rec-
ommendations from qualified independent federally funded re-
search and development centers in drafting the required report.
Support for clarifying budget materials for industry con-
sumption
The committee supports the importance of a consistent, clear de-
mand signal regarding defense spending and priorities for the de-
fense industrial base. The committee encourages the Department of
Defense—consistent with recommendations made by the Commis-
sion on Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Reform
in its March 2024 final report—to examine the structure, content,
and format for annual budget justification books and to strive for
some uniformity on these components across services and agencies.
The Department of Defense should consider how to improve its
communication of budget information to traditional, non-tradi-
tional, large, and small defense companies to spur innovation and
participation across the defense industrial base. The committee ac-
knowledges that small startup defense firms in particular are frus-
trated by the lack of clarity and plain language of defense budgets
and programs. The committee encourages the Department of De-
fense to work with Congress to rectify this issue.
Transportation to and from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay
The committee remains concerned about the challenges
servicemembers and their families face when stationed at Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with traveling to and from the in-
stallation. There are limited options for flights, which makes it
challenging for planning purposes, and there are no commercial
flight options. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the
Navy, in coordination with United States Transportation Command
(TRANSCOM), to brief the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, on how the transportation challenges impact servicemembers,
dependent family members, and other patrons with a need for trav-
el to and from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The briefing shall
include, but not be limited to: (1) How existing contracts can be ex-
panded and utilized to include mission specific transportation as
well as morale, welfare, and recreation travel for servicemembers
and their families; (2) Any additional resources required to expand
existing flight options; (3) Any existing challenges or limitations to
expand and offer additional options for servicemembers, families,
and other patrons; and (4) Any other matters the Secretary of the
Navy or TRANSCOM determine to be relevant.

Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security
Charter
The committee continues to believe that the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security (OUSD(I&S))
must be properly organized to fulfill its statutory and policy re-
sponsibilities in order to ensure that the defense intelligence enter-
prise is providing American warfighters with the intelligence they
need to deter, and if necessary, fight and win our nation’s wars.
The committee remains concerned that USD(I&S) governing docu-
mentation, particularly its chartering directive, does not accurately
reflect its roles and responsibilities. The committee urges
USD(I&S) to use the findings of the Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO) report on OUSD(I&S) roles and responsibilities, titled
‘‘Roles and Responsibilities of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Intelligence and Security.’’ That GAO information paper was re-
quired by the committee report (S. Rept. 118–188) accompanying
the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159),
to inform updates to all relevant Department of Defense policy doc-
umentation.
Therefore, the committee directs USD(I&S) to provide a briefing
to the congressional defense committees by April 6, 2026, on its
plan and timeline to update the USD(I&S) chartering directive and
to ensure all chartering directives for the organizations under
USD(I&S) authority, direction, and control are updated in line with
the USD(I&S) chartering directive.
Weather wing cloud modernization
The committee recognizes the 557th Weather Wing’s critical role
in delivering operational weather intelligence to combatant com-
manders, planners, and the Joint Force. Current legacy infrastruc-
ture significantly hinders the timely dissemination of high-fidelity
meteorological and atmospheric data, creating risks to force readi-
ness, mission effectiveness, and operational safety in dynamic and
contested environments. The committee notes that transitioning to
secure cloud-based systems, integrated with artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities, would enable faster
ingestion, automated analysis, and seamless sharing of weather
data from a diverse and growing array of sources. Real-time fore-
casting and predictive analytics would enhance mission planning,
better illuminate the operational environment, support time-sen-
sitive operational decisions, and reduce the impact of weather-re-
lated disruptions across global theaters of operation.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in coordination with the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the
Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, to sub-
mit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than March 1, 2026, that includes: (1) An assessment of operational
limitations imposed by current forecasting, data management, and
cloud infrastructure systems at the 557th Weather Wing; (2) A de-
tailed roadmap for secure, scalable cloud migration of the Wing’s
enterprise infrastructure, including anticipated technical mile-
stones; (3) A comprehensive survey of available commercial and
government-developed AI/ML tools capable of supporting advanced

TITLE XI—CIVILIAN PERSONNEL MATTERS
Subtitle A—Personnel Matters
Sec. 1101—Educational travel authority for dependents of
certain employees
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, notwithstanding section 1599b of title 10,
United States Code, to direct the Director of the Defense Travel
Management Office to update the Joint Travel Regulations to au-
thorize educational travel for a dependent of a covered employee
without regard to whether the Federal agency responsible for the
employment of the covered employee anticipates that the covered
employee will be transferred or travel to a location in the United
States for home leave. This authority is limited to Department of
Defense Education Activity (DODEA) employees assigned to Naval
Station Guantanamo Bay.
The committee acknowledges the unique challenges posed by
Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. There are no commercial flight
options to ensure a dependent could return home. Additionally, the
committee understands that the existing flights are quite limited,
and the priority list does not guarantee a seat for a dependent to
return home within the mandated window of time prior to the end
of a DODEA teacher’s school year and subsequent leave.
Sec. 1102—One-year extension of authority to waive annual
limitation on premium pay and aggregate limitation on
pay for Federal civilian employees working overseas
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1101 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110–417), as most recently
amended by section 1104 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159), to extend for 1 year the authority of
heads of executive agencies to waive the limitation on the aggre-
gate of basic and premium pay of employees who perform work
supporting certain military or contingency operations.
Sec. 1103—One-year extension of temporary authority to
grant allowances, benefits, and gratuities to civilian per-
sonnel on official duty in a combat zone
The committee recommends a provision that would extend for 1
year the discretionary authority of the head of a Federal agency to
provide allowances, benefits, and gratuities, comparable to those
provided to members of the Foreign Service, to the agency’s civilian
employees on official duty in a combat zone.

Sec. 1104—Modifications to Defense Civilian Training Corps
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2200h of title 10, United States Code, to provide direct hiring
authority for up to 60 graduates of the Defense Civilian Training
Corps every calendar year. The provision would also require the
Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of
the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight and Government Re-
form of the House of Representatives, not later than January 31,
2026, and annually thereafter until January 31, 2030, on the use
of this hiring authority.
Sec. 1105—Modifications to requirements for the President
of the Defense Acquisition University
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1746(e)(3) of title 10, United States Code, to modify require-
ments related to the President of Defense Acquisition University by
striking ‘‘term’’ in both places it appears and inserting ‘‘tenure.’’
Sec. 1106—Modification of direct hire authority for domestic
defense industrial base facilities
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1125 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2017 (Public Law 114–328) to clarify that the direct hire authority
provided by that section includes the Navy Supervisor of Ship-
building, Conversion, and Repair positions. The provision would
also require the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform of the House of Representatives on the
use of this authority.
Sec. 1107—Cyber workforce recruitment and retention
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1599f of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Sec-
retary of Defense to expand the cyber excepted service to include
any position the Secretary considers necessary to carry out the
cyber mission of the Department of Defense. The provision would
also authorize the Secretary to appoint personnel to the cyber ex-
cepted service without regard to any provision in title 5, United
States Code, governing the appointment of employees in the civil
service. Additionally, the provision would authorize the Secretary
to provide basic pay to employees in the cyber excepted service that
is consistent with comparable positions in the Federal Government,
but not to exceed 150 percent of salary paid for positions at Level
I of the Executive Schedule, and additional compensation up to a
maximum amount that is equivalent to the salary of the Vice Presi-
dent of the United States. Finally, the provision would authorize
the Secretary to establish a Defense Digital Executive Service for
positions in the cyber excepted service that are comparable to posi-
tions in the Senior Executive Service.

Finally, the provision would require the Comptroller General of
the United States to review implementation of this section and pro-
vide a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representa-
tives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than 5 years after the date of
the enactment of this Act.
The committee expects the Department to use this expanded au-
thority judiciously, consistent with the pay practices of other agen-
cies for similar positions.
Sec. 1108—Prohibition on use of funds to reduce the work-
force at public shipyards
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit
funds authorized by this Act from being used to reduce the work-
force at public shipyards.
Items of Special Interest
Civilian workforce policy
The committee recognizes that the current locality pay system
under the General Schedule may not adequately account for the
evolving economic and labor conditions that affect federal employ-
ees, particularly those in regions experiencing significant economic
growth and rising costs of living. The existing system may rely on
outdated methodologies that do not fully capture regional cost-of-
living differences or emerging workforce trends.
The committee is concerned that limitations in the current local-
ity pay system have led to recruitment and retention challenges in
critical mission areas, including national security and defense-re-
lated functions. This issue is particularly evident in states like
Utah, where defense installations, such as Hill Air Force Base, play
a vital role in national security. The Salt Lake City, Utah, metro-
politan area and surrounding regions have experienced rapid eco-
nomic growth, rising housing costs, and increased private-sector
competition, yet these factors may not be adequately reflected in
current locality pay adjustments.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in con-
sultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management,
to assess the locality pay system for Department of Defense em-
ployees. This assessment should include: (1) A review of current
methodologies used to determine locality pay adjustments and their
alignment with actual cost of living and labor market data; (2) An
evaluation of regional disparities that impact recruitment and re-
tention of Federal employees in defense-related roles; (3) Consider-
ation of alternative models, including adjustments based on broad-
er economic indicators, private-sector wage comparisons, and re-
gional housing market trends; and (4) Recommendations for legisla-
tive or administrative changes necessary to improve the accuracy,
fairness, and effectiveness of locality pay adjustments.

Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,

Scholarship for service hiring
The committee supports the scholarship for service programs of
the Department of Defense (DOD), including the Science, Mathe-
matics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program, the
Defense Civilian Training Corps (DCTC), and the Cyber Service
Academy (CSA), recognizing them as effective recruiting tools for
the Department. In exchange for the Department paying for some
portion of a participant’s post-secondary education, the participant
agrees to work as a civilian employee in the DOD.
The committee notes that the DOD is currently developing guid-
ance to address the placement of this year’s graduating students
from the SMART, DCTC, and CSA programs, enabling them to ful-
fill their service commitments. The committee appreciates the De-
partment’s efforts to ensure these students contribute to DOD mis-
sions, aligning with the significant investment in their education.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than January 31,
2026, on the status of scholarship for service program participants
(including SMART, DCTC, and CSA) who completed their agreed-
upon education from December 1, 2024, through September 31,
2025. The briefing shall include: (1) Whether these students were
hired by the Department as part of their service obligation; (2) If
these students were not hired, an explanation of the status of a
participant’s DOD civilian service obligation; and (3) If a partici-
pant’s service obligation was waived, an assessment of the costs to
the Department to provide the participant students’ education.
Hiring freeze and scholarship programs
The committee recognizes the critical importance of the Depart-
ment of Defense Cyber Service Academy (DOD CSA) scholarship
program, which provides tuition-free education to students in ex-
change for a commitment to serve in DOD or Intelligence Commu-
nity cybersecurity roles. This innovative program, established with
strong congressional support, addresses significant gaps in the na-
tional cybersecurity workforce by developing a pipeline of highly
qualified cyber professionals. The committee also recognizes the im-
portant role that other scholarship programs play, such as the
SMART Defense Scholarship Program and the David Boren Schol-
arship Program, and the benefits the Department receives from
graduates of non-DOD scholarship programs such as the National
Science Foundation CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service program.
The committee is concerned that despite the President’s memo-
randum on the hiring freeze including an exception for positions re-
lated to national security, a hiring freeze remains in place for key
cyber and science and technology roles. The DOD CSA alone in-
vests over $100,000 per student per year. The Department has in-
formed the committee that without a hiring exemption the Depart-
ment’s only course of action is to forgive graduates’ service commit-
ments and forgive any payback. The continued hiring freeze there-

fore risks wasting significant taxpayer money and ensures that key
national security roles remain unfilled.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Secretary of Defense
to press for the authorized exception to the hiring freeze for schol-
arship program graduates and ensure that the exception is in place
before our investments in spring 2025 graduates are lost.

modifications.
Sec. 1215—Extension and modification of authority to pro-
vide certain support
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1226 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year

port to certain governments for border security through December
31, 2027, and make other modifications.
Sec. 1216—Security and oversight of al-Hol and Roj camps
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the

Roj camps and the security for detainees within such camps, in-
cluding through support for vetted foreign partner security forces,

2028 on the security and oversight of al-Hol and Roj camps.
Sec. 1217—Limitation on use of funds for reduction or con-
solidation of United States Armed Forces bases in Syria
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the

cation that the Government of Iraq has undertaken specified ac-
tions.
Subtitle C—Matters Relating to Europe and the Russian
Federation

tion Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–236) to extend the
prohibition of funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act for

activity that recognizes the sovereignty of the Russian Federation
over the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine.

rity developments involving the Russian Federation
The committee recommends a provision that would extend sec-
tion 1234 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense

through January 31, 2031.
Sec. 1223—Extension and modification of Ukraine Security

The committee affirms that USAI has proven effective in pro-
viding the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) with critical capabilities
to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity while also in-
vesting in U.S. defense industries. USAI will remain an important
avenue through which to support the continued development of the

Defense to create a Ukrainian depot maintenance plan and to pro-
vide that plan to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives.
Sec. 1225—Oversight of United States military posture in

The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated by
this Act to reduce the total number of members of the Armed
Forces permanently stationed in or deployed to the U.S. European
Command area of responsibility below 76,000, to divest of property,

days after the Secretary of Defense submits an assessment and cer-
tification to the appropriate committees of the Congress regarding

equipment procured has been transferred to the Government of
Ukraine and is returned by Ukraine to the United States.

Sec. 1229—International Security Cooperation Program
funding for United States European Command
The committee recommends a provision that would require that
not less than 15 percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated
by this Act for the International Security Cooperation Program
shall be available for use by the U.S. European Command.
Sec. 1230—Promotion of the Joint Ukrainian Multinational
Program—Services, Training and Articles Rapid
Timeline (JUMPSTART)
The committee recommends a provision that would express the
sense of Congress that the Department of Defense should employ
existing programs and authorities including the Joint Ukrainian
Multinational Program—Services, Training, and Articles Rapid
Timeline (JUMPSTART) to work with European partners to sup-
port and expedite the delivery of weapons, training, and logistics
to Ukraine. The provision would also require the Secretary of De-
fense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees
describing opportunities to expand the use of the JUMPSTART pro-
gram, a summary of Department efforts to accelerate delivery of
equipment to Ukraine, an analysis of opportunities and advantages
of pooling resources with allies for such efforts, and any regulatory
and legislative changes needed to enhance the effectiveness of
JUMPSTART.
Sec. 1230A—Modification of United States basing and train-
ing, and exercises in North Atlantic Treaty Organization
member countries
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1250 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to direct the Secretary of Defense, when
considering decisions related to U.S. military basing and training
in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, to con-
sider among the factors whether a country has submitted its an-
nual plan to meet, and has made progress toward, the NATO
spending pledge to spend 5 percent of Gross Domestic Product on
defense by 2035.
Subtitle D—Matters Relating to the Indo-Pacific Region
Sec. 1231—Extension of Pacific Deterrence Initiative
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1251 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) to ex-
tend the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) through fiscal year
2026.
The committee reaffirms its support for the PDI as a mechanism
to strengthen U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific and to enhance
transparency into the Department of Defense’s activities that sup-
port deterrence, reassure allies and partners, and build readiness
and operational capability in the region—primarily west of the
International Date Line. However, the committee remains con-
cerned that the Department’s approach to identifying pro-
grammatic investments for PDI lacks consistency, alignment with

strategic priorities, and internal accountability. Additionally, there
is significant variation in how the Office of the Secretary of De-
fense, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the military services, and others
in the Department interpret and apply criteria to select programs
for the PDI budget exhibit—making it difficult for the Congress to
evaluate progress, assess tradeoffs, and identify trends over time.
To improve the transparency and utility of the PDI budget ex-
hibit, the committee directs the Department to annually include op-
eration and maintenance budget estimates for all operational forces
and supporting enablers west of the International Date Line, along
with any enhancements to those forces. While the focus of PDI
should be on enhancements, these cannot be properly evaluated
without visibility of the baseline they are intended to enhance. En-
hancements may include operation and maintenance, procurement,
and military construction programs. In all cases, however, enhance-
ments should be primarily west of the International Date Line or
necessary for missions west of the International Date Line. The
committee further directs the Department to include budget esti-
mates related to deployments or rotations of units west of the
International Date Line. The committee also directs the Depart-
ment to include routine costs west of the International Date Line
if they are directly supporting a PDI category and selected consist-
ently across the Department’s components; for example, such costs
could include facilities sustainment restoration and modernization.
The committee notes that this direction is intended to supplement,
not replace, existing statutory requirements for the PDI budget ex-
hibit.
As noted in the committee report accompanying S. 4638 (S. Rept.
118–188), the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025, as passed by
the Senate, the committee believes the PDI could be used more ef-
fectively to incentivize additional investments by the military serv-
ices in joint enabling capabilities needed in the Indo-Pacific the-
ater. The committee continues to urge the Department to utilize a
total obligation authority withhold technique for a significant por-
tion of the PDI. The committee notes that the Department still has
not complied with the requirement expressed in last year’s com-
mittee report to provide the congressional defense committees with
a plan for utilizing a total obligation authority withhold technique,
as appropriate, for future PDI budget requests across the Future
Years Defense Plan.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, with
input from the military services, Indo-Pacific Command, and other
relevant stakeholders, to revise the Department’s guidance for PDI
program selection. This revised guidance should reflect the direc-
tion above and establish consistent processes for component-level
review of PDI selections. The committee further directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to brief the congressional defense committees on
this revised PDI guidance, not later than June 30, 2026.
Sec. 1232—Extension of authority to transfer funds for Bien

Sec. 1233—Oversight of United States military posture on
the Korean Peninsula
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated by
this Act to reduce the total number of members of the Armed
Forces permanently stationed in or deployed to the Republic of
Korea below 28,500 or to complete the transition of wartime oper-
ational control of the United States-Republic of Korea Combined
Forces Command from United States-led command to Republic of
Korea-led command until 90 days after the Secretary of Defense
submits an assessment and certification to the appropriate commit-
tees of the Congress regarding such action.
Sec. 1234—Limitation on availability of funds for travel ex-
penses of the Office of the Secretary of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
obligation or expenditure of 25 percent of the funding authorized
for travel expenses for the Office of the Secretary of Defense until
various overdue reports related to the Indo-Pacific are submitted to
the congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1235—Bolstering industrial resilience with allies in
Indo-Pacific region
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State,
to establish and maintain a security cooperation initiative to
strengthen cooperation among the defense industrial bases of the
United States and allied and partner countries in the Indo-Pacific
region. In addition, the Secretary of Defense is required to provide
the congressional defense committees with a report outlining
progress in establishing the initiative on a recurring basis begin-
ning on January 1, 2027 and annually thereafter until 2031. The
provision would also require the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
the House of Representatives not later than December 1, 2026 and
annually thereafter until 2030.
Sec. 1236—Modification of Taiwan security cooperation ini-
tiative
The committee recommends a provision that would modify the
Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative authorized by section 1323
of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–
159) by adding medical equipment, supplies, and related combat
casualty care capabilities as a category of authorized assistance
under the initiative.

The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, not later than March 1, 2026, to seek to en-
gage with appropriate officials of Taiwan in a joint program for the
purpose of enabling the fielding of uncrewed systems and counter-
uncrewed systems capabilities, including co-development and co-

States and the military forces of Taiwan, consistent with the Tai-
wan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8).
Sec. 1238—Report on critical digital infrastructure of Tai-
wan
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than 180 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, analyzing the critical digital infrastructure capa-
bilities of Taiwan and identifying potential Department of Defense
actions that could help to enable the protection of such infrastruc-
ture, consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 94–
469).
Sec. 1239—Report on Japanese counterstrike capabilities
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to provide the congressional defense commit-
tees with a report, not later than 180 days after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, outlining Department of Defense efforts to sup-
port Japan in the fielding of an operational counterstrike capa-
bility.

port to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, the Committee on Foreign Relations of
the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of
Representatives on enhancing United States security cooperation
with the Philippines.
Sec. 1241—Modification to annual report on military and se-
curity developments involving the People’s Republic of
China
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1202(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2000 (Public Law 106–65), as amended, to direct the Sec-
retary of Defense to include in the report on the military and secu-

nese entities subject to restrictions or scrutiny maintained by the
United States Government during the annual revision in which
such entity was added.
Sec. 1246—Preventing circumvention by Chinese military
companies in third-party countries
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-

Sec. 1251—Middle East integrated air and missile defense
architecture
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to continue efforts to cooperate with allies and
partners in the Middle East with respect to implementing an inte-
grated air and missile defense architecture to protect the people,
infrastructure, and territory of such allies and partners from cruise
and ballistic missiles, manned and unmanned aerial systems, and
rocket attacks from Iran and groups linked to Iran, as well as re-
quire the Secretary to submit a report to the congressional defense
committees, not later than May 31, 2026, on matters related to air
and missile defense in the region.
Sec. 1252—Modification of program and processes relating
to foreign acquisition
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 873 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to direct the geographic combatant com-
mands to hire not more than two members of the acquisition work-
force to advise the combatant command on the Department of De-
fense processes for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and security co-
operation to facilitate effective implementation of those processes.
The provision would also make this authority permanent.
The committee encourages the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the Director of
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, to maximize opportuni-
ties to leverage the defense acquisition workforce and the Defense
Acquisition Workforce Development Account to support the security
cooperation workforce in meeting FMS demands.
The committee notes that section 873 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) also re-
quired the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with representa-
tives of the defense industrial base, to establish an advisory group
focused on the role of the Department in FMS and security co-
operation. The committee directs the Secretary to provide a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, not later than February 1, 2026, on the estab-
lishment and progress made by this advisory group.
Sec. 1253—Enhancing security partnership with Jordan and
Lebanon
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense, pursuant to authorities available to the Sec-
retary, to seek to provide assistance, including training, equipment,
logistics support, supplies, and services to the Government of Jor-
dan and the Government of Lebanon for the purposes of supporting
and enhancing efforts of the military forces of Jordan and the mili-
tary forces of Lebanon to ensure the territorial security of Jordan
and Lebanon. The provision would also require, not later than De-
cember 31, 2025, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the
Commander, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), to submit to the

of the Department of Defense to provide assistance to the military
forces of Jordan and the military forces of Lebanon for such pur-
poses.
The committee notes the longstanding security relationship be-
tween the Department of Defense and the military forces of Jordan
and Lebanon and the critical role these relationships play in pro-
moting stability and security in the region. In light of the signifi-
cant changes in regional security dynamics in recent years, the
committee views strengthening these relationships as an important
component of the Department’s efforts in the CENTCOM area of
responsibility and notes that chapter 16 of title 10, United States
Code, as well as other provisions of law, provide the Secretary with
relevant authorities to enable such efforts.
Sec. 1254—Joint Program Office for Non-Programs of
Record to support foreign acquisition
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish and charter, within the Office of
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment,
a Joint Program Office for Non-Programs of Record, not later than
180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. In addition,
the provision would require the Secretary to provide a briefing, not
later than 30 days after the establishment of the Joint Program Of-
fice, to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives on the charter, responsibilities, resources,
and plan of activities for the Joint Program Office for the subse-
quent fiscal year.
Sec. 1255—Extension and modification of United States-
Israel anti-tunnel cooperation
The committee recommends a provision that would modify sec-
tion 1279 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2016 (Public Law 114–92) by extending the authority through De-
cember 31, 2028, and increasing the amount authorized for such
activities.
Sec. 1256—Extension and modification of United States-
Israel cooperation to counter unmanned aerial systems
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1278 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2020 (Public Law 116–92) to extend the existing authority through
December 31, 2028, and to increase the amount authorized for such
activities.
Sec. 1257—Guidance for coordination of international arms
transfers
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense, in accordance with section 382 of title 10,
United States Code, to streamline and align the roles, responsibil-
ities, and authorities, as well as improve transparency, relating to
Department of Defense processes for international arms transfers,
including Foreign Military Sales (FMS). The provision would also
require the Secretary of Defense to designate a lead ‘‘data czar’’ re-
sponsible for collecting, tracking, coordinating, and sharing data

the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, not less
than 30 days after the issuance of the updated guidance, on the im-
plementation of that updated guidance.
Sec. 1258—Requirement to update the National Disclosure
Policy
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to develop a framework for revising and up-
dating the National Disclosure Policy (NDP–1), not later than 180
days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and on an annual
basis thereafter to maintain currency with the rapid pace of tech-
nology change. In addition, the provision would direct the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy to provide a report to the congres-
sional defense committees, on an annual basis, describing updates
to the NDP–1 and any associated implementation challenges.
Sec. 1259—Improvements to security cooperation workforce
and defense acquisition workforce
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to issue guidance regarding foreign military
sales to the security cooperation workforce and the acquisition
workforce and modify the Foreign Military Sales Continuous Proc-
ess Improvement Board established by section 1210 of the Service-
member Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) to speci-
fy that three members of the board shall not be employees of the
Department of Defense or members of the Armed Forces.
Sec. 1260—Expansion of country prioritization
The committee recommends a provision that would clarify that
the Secretary of Defense may assign a Defense Priorities Allocation
System rating for foreign military sales.
In an effort to expedite the delivery of defense items to strategi-
cally important American partners and allies, the committee urges
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment
(USD(A&S)) to prioritize systems for sale to Israel, Japan, the Re-
public of Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, member countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, major defense partners, and
members of the national technology and industrial base, including
through use of Defense Priorities and Allocations System ratings.
Filling the requirements of America’s closest allies as quickly as
possible once defense articles have been approved for transfer is a
force multiplier in pursuit of U.S. national defense. The committee
believes the USD (A&S) should recognize this and fully account for
it in its contracting practices.
Sec. 1261—Streamlining and expediting sales of defense arti-
cles and services
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to develop an acquisition strategy that estab-

lishes alternative acquisition paths for the procurement of Foreign
Military Sales. The provision also allows prime contractors to begin
the process of acquiring long-lead government furnished equipment
prior to the execution of a signed commercial contract or of a letter
of offer and acceptance.
Sec. 1262—Redesignation of the Africa Center for Strategic
Studies as the James M. Inhofe Center for Africa Secu-
rity Studies
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 342 of title 10, United States Code, to designate the Africa
Center for Strategic Studies as the James M. Inhofe Center for Af-
rica Security Studies.
Sec. 1263—Establishment of program to promote participa-
tion of foreign students in the Senior Reserve Officers’
Training Corps
The committee recommends a provision that would establish a
program to promote the participation of foreign students in the
Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.
Sec. 1264—Modification of authority for assistance in sup-
port of Department of Defense accounting for missing
United States Government personnel
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 408(a) of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the Depart-
ment of Defense to procure goods and services from foreign nations
to assist the Department in its mission to recover and account for
missing United States Government personnel.
Items of Special Interest
AUKUS senior civilian official
The committee reaffirms the requirement for the Department of
Defense, as required by section 1332 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) to: (1)
Designate a senior civilian official of the Department who shall be
responsible for overseeing the Department’s activities relating to
the AUKUS partnership; and (2) Provide semiannual briefings to
the congressional defense committees on the status of the AUKUS
agreement not later than April 1st and October 1st of each year.
Therefore, the committee directs that the Department’s senior civil-
ian official for AUKUS be identified to the committee in writing
and that the semiannual briefing be provided to the committee not
later than October 1, 2025.
Contracting support relative to Taiwan
The committee notes that section 6 of the Taiwan Relations Act
(Public Law 96–8) directs that transactions by any agency of the
U.S. Government relative to Taiwan shall be carried out by or
through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). The committee
understands that AIT has limited capacity to provide contracting
support for non-AIT requirements. Therefore, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to engage with the Secretary of State, the

Director of the AIT, and the heads of other departments and agen-
cies, as appropriate, for the purpose of establishing a process for
ensuring timely contracting support for non-AIT requirements.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not
later than December 31, 2025, describing the outcome of such en-
gagements.
Cooperation between United States and Vietnam
The committee notes the critical role that joint United States-
Vietnam efforts to address legacy issues related to the Vietnam
War have played in fostering bilateral security cooperation and
strengthening the United States-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership. The committee commends the Departments of Defense
and State for continuing to fulfill U.S. commitments to fund dioxin
(Agent Orange) clean-up operations at former U.S. bases and
unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance programs, to assist those se-
verely disabled as a result of UXO accidents and dioxin exposure,
and to enhance Vietnam’s capacity to identify the remains of Viet-
namese missing since the war. The committee supports the con-
tinuation of such efforts.
Department of Defense support to maritime law enforce-
ment activities in Indo-Pacific region
The committee believes that the Department of Defense must
continue to support the U.S. Coast Guard as it works with our al-
lies and partners to address challenges in the Indo-Pacific region,
including those posed by illegal, unreported, and unregulated fish-
ing (IUU) and illegal trafficking of people and drugs. The com-
mittee notes that section 1252 of the James M. Inhofe National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263)
authorized the use of funds under the Indo-Pacific Maritime Secu-
rity Initiative to facilitate the participation of U.S. Coast Guard
personnel in, and the use of U.S. Coast Guard capabilities for,
training, exercises, and other activities with foreign countries.
Therefore, not later than October 1, 2025, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Commandant of
the U.S. Coast Guard, to provide a briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees on the demand for U.S. Coast Guard capabilities
and expertise in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area of responsi-
bility. At a minimum, the briefing should include an identification
of: (1) Opportunities for the U.S. Coast Guard to play a greater role
in supporting the Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance in
the Indo-Pacific region; (2) Opportunities for the U.S. Coast Guard
to assume additional responsibilities in the Indo-Pacific region to
alleviate the demand for U.S. Navy capabilities; (3) Opportunities
to increase engagement with and support to foreign partners; and
(4) Any additional legislative or resourcing changes necessary to
take advantage of opportunities identified above.

States-Mexico border. The committee recognizes that Department
of Defense (DOD) support to the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) may benefit from clear and consistent communication chan-
nels with Mexican military forces operating across the United
States-Mexico border.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in co-
ordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Sec-
retary of State, to submit a report, not later than March 1, 2026,
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations of the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the
House of Representatives detailing current practices, identified
gaps, and planned enhancements to United States-Mexico military
communication during border-related DOD support to DHS. The re-
port should: (1) Identify existing communication protocols, liaison
arrangements, Memorandums of Agreement, or other coordination
instruments between the United States military and the Mexican
Secretariat of National Defense and Secretariat of the Navy rel-
evant to border operations; (2) Assess gaps or limitations in current
bilateral military communication that may affect coordination,
deconfliction, or situational awareness during DOD support mis-
sions along the southern border, including identifying any statutory
or regulatory changes needed to facilitate better communication; (3)
Ensure that appropriate communication procedures, language capa-
bilities, and liaison officers are in place to support operational co-
ordination, consistent with operational security and applicable
legal authorities; and (4) Develop and implement improvements as
necessary to strengthen real-time operational communication be-
tween United States and Mexican military personnel in the context
of United States border support activities.
Foreign Military Sales contract modifications
The committee notes that there may be an understanding in the
defense acquisition workforce that an existing contract for defense
articles may not be modified more than once a year for the pur-
poses of filling a foreign sale with economy of scale. This results
in a delay of at least a year, assuming changes in price over that
period do not create additional delays to get on contract. The com-
mittee is aware of no legal, regulatory, or policy directive sup-
porting this practice.
Foreign Military Sales timeline
The committee continues to be concerned regarding the timeli-
ness of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, particularly
delays in deliveries of defense articles to foreign partners, which
can undermine partners’ military readiness and defense.
Therefore, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act, and not less frequently than once every 180 days there-
after until the earlier of either the date all recommendations devel-
oped by the Department of Defense’s ‘‘Tiger Team’’ to optimize the
FMS process are implemented or otherwise closed or the date that
is 3 years from the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary

of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as the Comp-
troller General of the United States, a report on the progress of the
Continuous Process Improvement Board (CPIB), including the sta-
tus of its implementation of these recommendations.
The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct an
independent evaluation of the actions taken by the Secretary of De-
fense to carry out the requirements of this section. The Comptroller
General shall brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives on the contents of the evalua-
tion of the Secretary of Defense’s report not later than 12 months
after it is submitted. The Comptroller General will also conduct a
report on the progress and effectiveness of CPIB efforts, including
any legislative and administrative recommendations to enhance
CPIB timelines and outcomes. This report will be delivered to the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives in a mutually agreed upon timeframe.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing
The committee believes that illegal, unreported, and unregulated
(IUU) fishing constitutes a threat to the sovereignty, economic via-
bility, and national security of allies and partners of the United
States, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. The committee notes
that IUU fishing has been used as a form of coercion by the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and, according to the annual Department
of Defense report titled ‘‘Military and Security Developments In-
volving the People’s Republic of China,’’ Chinese vessels partici-
pating in IUU fishing have been protected and facilitated by the
Chinese Maritime Militia. The committee also notes that address-
ing the challenges posed by IUU fishing requires coordination
across various departments and agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment.
Therefore, the committee urges the Secretary of Defense, as ap-
propriate, to: (1) Continue engagement with allies and partners in
the Indo-Pacific region, especially in the Pacific Islands, to address
the challenges posed by IUU fishing; (2) Provide assistance, using
existing authorities available to the Secretary of Defense, to build
the capacity of priority foreign partners to address the challenges
posed by IUU fishing; (3) Leverage maritime domain awareness ca-
pabilities, including those available under the Indo-Pacific Mari-
time Security Initiative, to enhance the capabilities of priority part-
ners to address the challenges posed by IUU fishing; (4) Support
the collection and analysis of data on IUU fishing; (5) Consult with
the Interagency Working Group on IUU fishing and develop rec-
ommendations for establishing an IUU fishing data and informa-
tion sharing center; and (6) Ensure Department components coordi-
nate IUU-related activities with the Economic Defense Unit estab-
lished elsewhere in this Act.
The committee also directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a
briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later than Oc-
tober 1, 2025, regarding contributions by the Department to ad-
dressing the challenges posed by IUU fishing in concert with other
interagency and foreign partners.

Indo-Pacific Multilateral Security Cooperation Initiatives
The committee notes that section 1208 of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159) authorizes the Sec-
retary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State,
to accept funds, defense articles, and defense services from foreign
governments for mutually agreed upon purposes to carry out secu-
rity cooperation programs and activities of the Department of De-
fense. The committee believes this authority holds significant po-
tential for facilitating multilateral security cooperation activities in
the Indo-Pacific region.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to seek
to engage with appropriate officials from Japan, Australia, the Re-
public of Korea, and other partners, as appropriate, for the purpose
of establishing multilateral security cooperation initiatives with the
national security forces of mutual foreign partners in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. The objective should be to: (1) Build the capacity of the
national security forces of mutual foreign partners in the Indo-Pa-
cific region; (2) Enhance interoperability among participating na-
tional security forces of such partners; and (3) Coordinate, de-con-
flict, and efficiently leverage the security assistance efforts of the
United States, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and other
partners in the Indo-Pacific region.
Additionally, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than December 31, 2025, to provide a report to the congres-
sional defense committees regarding efforts to establish multilat-
eral security cooperation initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region, in-
cluding using the authority provided under section 1208 of Public
Law 118–159. At a minimum, the report should include: (1) A de-
scription of efforts to establish multilateral security cooperation ini-
tiatives in the Indo-Pacific region, including consultations with ap-
propriate officials from Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea,
and other partners; (2) An identification of any additional resources
or authorities necessary to support such initiatives; and (3) Any
other matters the Secretary of Defense considers relevant.
Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance strategy
Sahel
The committee notes that due to recent security developments in
the Sahel, United States posture in the region has shifted dramati-
cally. Several changes, like the withdrawal of United States forces
from Niger, have hindered the United States military’s ability to
conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mis-
sions in the Sahel.
Therefore, the committee directs the Commander, U.S. Africa
Command (AFRICOM) to provide a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than March 1, 2026, that describes efforts to develop an
integrated ISR strategy to increase domain awareness in the Sahel
for the purpose of force protection and to assist partners in the re-
gion as they work to protect their people, infrastructure, and terri-
tory from violent extremist organizations, criminal networks, and
other entities that threaten security and stability in the Sahel.

The report required shall include the following elements: (1) An
assessment of the threats posed to countries in the Sahel by violent
extremist organizations, criminal networks, and other actors that
threaten security and stability; (2) An assessment of current ISR
capabilities in the Sahel, including overflight rights and basing
considerations; (3) A description of efforts to engage ally and part-
ner countries in AFRICOM’s area of responsibility to establish or
enhance ISR architecture, including overflight rights and basing;
(4) An identification of the elements of such an architecture that
may be acquired and operated by ally and partner countries in
AFRICOM’s area of responsibility, and a list of such elements for
each such ally and partner; (5) An identification of the elements of
such an architecture that may only be provided and operated by
members of the U.S. Armed Forces; (6) An identification of any
challenge to optimizing such an architecture in AFRICOM’s area of
responsibility; and (7) Any other matter the Commander considers
relevant.
Kurdish Peshmerga forces
The committee commends the Department of Defense’s commit-
ment to defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by sup-
porting vetted partner forces to maintain pressure against ISIS.
The committee also commends the Department’s support for the
Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund as it provides targeted support
to sustain partner forces and increasing vetted partner force capa-
bility.
The committee notes that the 2025 Annual Threat Assessment
by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence assesses that
ISIS remains the world’s largest Islamic terrorist organization and
has sought to gain momentum from high-profile attacks and con-
tinues to rely on its most capable branches and globally dispersed
leadership to weather degradation. The committee also notes that
the Kurdish Peshmerga forces and the Iraqi Security Forces have
long served as vital partners of the United States in degrading and
defeating the threat from ISIS. Therefore, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing, not later than De-
cember 30, 2025, to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives on the Counter-ISIS Train
and Equip Fund, the status of equipment delivery to Kurdish
Peshmerga forces, and plans to improve the ability of the Kurdish
Peshmerga forces to support counterterrorism operations with the
Iraqi Security Forces and the United States.
People’s Republic of China security detection equipment at
strategic ports
The committee is aware that Tongfang Technology, a state-owned

committee is concerned that a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned
enterprise overseeing screening technologies at strategic transit
points could pose a threat to military operational security and oper-
ational effectiveness.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than January 30, 2026, on measures being taken to assess and
mitigate the security threats posed to operational security and pos-
sible covert identification and tracking of U.S. defense articles tra-
versing through transportation hubs that use Nuctech scanners.
Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreements
The committee emphasizes that defense-related acquisitions from
qualified sources under Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agree-
ments should remain exempt from any tariffs or trade restrictions.
The committee urges the Department of Defense and relevant
interagency stakeholders to preserve existing exemptions and en-
sure that future trade actions do not hinder defense procurement
or compromise national security priorities.
Security cooperation with Co-operative Republic of Guyana
The committee notes that in 2025, the U.S. Secretary of State
and the Guyanese Minister of Foreign Affairs signed a memo-
randum of understanding (MOU) to deepen security cooperation be-
tween the two countries and to address regional challenges to
counter transnational crime and deter drug trafficking in the Car-
ibbean region. The committee encourages the Department of De-
fense to strengthen the military-to-military partnership with the
Co-operative Republic of Guyana to build upon the 2025 MOU.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, not
later than October 1, 2026, to submit to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report
on: (1) U.S. security cooperation with the Co-operative Republic of
Guyana for the past 5 years; and (2) Any plan for future security
cooperation with the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.
State Partnership Program
The committee notes the importance of the State Partnership
Program (SPP) in building cooperation with our allies and part-
ners. This cooperation can include working together to build inno-
vative defense capabilities to address the security needs of the
United States, its State Partnership Program partner, or both.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chief of the National Guard
Bureau, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment and the Under Secretary of Defense
for Research and Engineering, and other relevant elements of the
Department of Defense, to provide a briefing to the Senate Armed
Services Committee, not later than March 31, 2026, on the SPP.
The briefing should, at a minimum, address the following: (1) A de-
scription of SPP activities that involve collaboration on technology;
(2) A description of any opportunities to utilize SPP activities with
foreign partners to collaborate on and develop emerging tech-
nologies; and (3) Any other matters the Chief of the National
Guard Bureau deems relevant.

Strategic ports reporting
The committee notes that the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
is seeking to establish a stronger logistics and basing infrastruc-
ture overseas to allow the PRC to deploy and sustain military
forces at further distances. The committee notes that PRC access
to select foreign ports poses a potential impact to U.S. national se-
curity.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in co-
ordination with relevant Federal departments and agencies, to pro-
vide a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than March 10, 2026,
outlining:
(1) A list of strategic foreign ports operated, controlled, or
owned directly or indirectly by the PRC;
(2) An assessment of any impact to U.S. national security re-
sulting from PRC control of such foreign ports;
(3) A description of Department of Defense efforts to coordi-
nate with other Federal departments and agencies to counter
or mitigate the national security threats posed by PRC control
of such foreign ports; and
(4) Any other matters deemed relevant by the Secretary.
Strategy on increasing membership in the Comprehensive
Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement
The committee recognizes the strategic importance of the Com-
prehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement
(CSIPA), signed in Washington, D.C., on September 13, 2023, as a
mechanism for enhancing regional cooperation on defense, eco-
nomic development, and technological innovation. CSIPA has
played a key role in improving joint military readiness, fostering
shared economic interests, and advancing scientific collaboration
among member states in the Middle East.
The committee is particularly interested in how CSIPA has sup-
ported effective multinational responses to emerging security
threats, including Houthi attacks on merchant vessels in the Red
Sea following October 7, 2023, and the deterrence posture main-
tained through U.S. naval operations in the region. The potential
of further expansion of CSIPA membership would strengthen re-
gional stability, improve collective deterrence against the Islamic
Republic of Iran and other malign actors, and advance U.S. stra-
tegic objectives.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than July 1, 2026, that
includes, at a minimum: (1) An assessment of the strategic benefits
of CSIPA to regional and global security; (2) An assessment of
CSIPA’s operational value to the Department of Defense and part-
ners in the region following the Red Sea attacks; (3) An assessment
of how CSIPA leverages U.S. military assets such as the Fifth Fleet
to address regional threats; (4) Identification of potential modifica-
tions to the CSIPA framework that would support broader regional
participation; (5) An evaluation of the resource and capability re-
quirements necessary to expand CSIPA membership; and (6) Rec-

United States-Morocco defense partnership
The committee notes the importance of the United States-Mo-
rocco defense partnership to regional security across a range of in-
terests, including U.S. Africa Command-led African Lion training
exercises, which are the largest of their kind on the African con-
tinent; counterterrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing; and
the National Guard’s State Partnership Program. The committee
continues to monitor the relationship with an eye toward facili-
tating greater security cooperation.

Items of Special Interest
Advancing cobalt production in the United States
The committee continues to emphasize the importance of miti-
gating dependencies on the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for
batteries and other defense component supply chains by investing
in U.S. processing and refining capability. Cobalt sulfate is essen-
tial to battery technologies, and cobalt metal is vital in a variety
of aerospace and defense weapon systems. Both are fundamental to
a secure military and high-technology economy. Without assured
access to them, nearly every military platform and advanced tech-
nology that the United States depends on would be inoperable. The
committee remains concerned that America’s substantial depend-
ence on the PRC for processing of cobalt poses significant risks to
military readiness and economic competitiveness.
Domestic recycling of critical minerals
The committee commends the ongoing work of the Department
of Defense to expand sources for the National Defense Stockpile for
germanium through recycling. The committee believes that pro-
grams like the Strategic Material Recovery and Reuse Program
(SMRRP) can foster the creation of new sources for strategic and
critical materials to improve supply chain shortfalls.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Acquisition and Sustainment to provide a one-time brief-
ing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than March
1, 2026, on an assessment of the ability to leverage best practices
from existing recycling efforts of the SMRRP to potentially expand
and increase the scale to recycle, reuse, or otherwise recover any
additional materials, such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, and any other
materials determined to be a strategic and critical material under
section 3(a) of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act
(50 U.S.C. 98b(a)).
Material preference for the National Defense Stockpile
The committee remains concerned that the Department of De-
fense (DOD) is vulnerable to supply chain uncertainty for certain
critical and strategic materials. Accordingly, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense to brief the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
March 1, 2026, on: (1) The identification of 10 materials or prod-
ucts already included in the DOD National Defense Stockpile,
which the DOD could procure to improve domestic production and
decrease national security vulnerabilities; (2) Recommended or re-
quired amounts of material for domestic procurement for each iden-

tified material or product for the next 3 years; (3) A public list of
materials or products and target percentages that is releasable to
industry, allies, and partners; and (4) Any potential challenges en-
countered by increasing domestic sourcing for such materials.
Reimbursement of Armed Forces Retirement Home for med-
ical care provided to TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries
The committee is aware that the Armed Forces Retirement Home
(AFRH) continues to face challenges in receiving reimbursement for
medical care it provides to residents who are eligible for health
care under the TRICARE program. The Joint Explanatory State-
ment to Accompany the Servicemember Quality of Life Improve-
ment and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025
(Public Law 118–159) required the Secretary of Defense to brief the
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives on the legal and policy issues related to the inabil-
ity to provide reimbursement for AFRH resident healthcare. Based
upon that briefing, the committee is aware of two existing impedi-
ments to TRICARE reimbursing the AFRH for the care provided to
eligible TRICARE beneficiaries.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1)
Progress made on transitioning the AFRH’s current health records
system to MHS Genesis; (2) The determination made on the ability
of the AFRH’s existing health record system to provide data needed
for TRICARE billing and reimbursement, including specifics about
any changes to the system required to effectuate TRICARE billing
and reimbursement and an estimate of the cost for making these
changes; (3) Any statutory impediments related to appropriations
issues; and (4) Any other matters the Secretary determines rel-
evant to enabling reimbursement for healthcare offered to
TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries at the AFRH.
Securing niobium supply
The committee supports the ongoing efforts of the Department of
Defense to increase the domestic production of high-purity niobium
to meet the requirements of the defense industrial base. The com-
mittee encourages the Department to continue eliminating depend-
ence on foreign sources for strategic and critical materials, espe-
cially those in supply chains located in, or with beneficial owner-
ship in, foreign entities of concern.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
brief the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than March
1, 2026, on the: (1) Progress of niobium-related investments or
projects within the Department; (2) An estimate of how many De-
partment of Defense programs rely on foreign sources of niobium;
and (3) Approximate timelines to transition the niobium supply
chain to domestic or allied sources of supply.
Support for continued focus on critical mineral investment

secure domestic and allied sources of critical minerals and mate-
rials through Industrial Base Resilience program investments. The

TITLE XV—SPACE ACTIVITIES, STRATEGIC
PROGRAMS, AND INTELLIGENCE MATTERS
Subtitle A—Space Activities
Sec. 1501—Delay in implementation of environmental as-
sessment for rocket cargo test and demonstration at
Johnston Atoll
The committee recommends a provision that would delay the im-
plementation of the Environmental Assessment for Rocket Cargo
Test and Demonstration at Johnston Atoll, United States (EAXX–
007–57–USF–1728497279, March 3, 2025) until the notice of intent
is further modified to include the consideration of the Ronald
Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, U.S. Army Garrison—
Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands.
The committee notes that this test site has long been the Major
Range Test Facility Base for missile defense and rocket launch ac-
tivities and should be considered in such a site selection for cost,
environmental impact, and existing capability for range instrumen-
tation, given the concept of operations for rocket cargo.
Sec. 1502—Study on future space launch capacity
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive study on future
space launch capacity, including long-term capacity, infrastructure,
and strategic viability of existing and potential heavy and super
heavy space launch sites. A report of the findings of this study will
be delivered to the House and Senate Committees on Armed Serv-
ices not later than March 31, 2026.
The committee supports the Department of Defense’s effort to as-
sess the long-term capacity and sustainability of domestic space
launch infrastructure for heavy and super heavy vehicles. As na-
tional security space launch demand continues to increase, driven
by both defense and commercial sector growth, the committee be-
lieves it is critical to ensure that existing sites, including Cape Ca-
naveral Space Force Station and Vandenberg Space Force Base, re-
main capable, efficient, and resilient. The committee also supports
the consideration of alternate or complementary launch locations
that could enhance strategic flexibility, reduce congestion, and sup-
port future mission requirements.
Sec. 1503—Acquisition and operation of space systems for
space warfighting and control
The committee recommends a provision stipulating that any
weapon systems intended to produce space control effects to adver-
sary satellite systems be acquired and operated by the U.S. Space
Force, with commercial augmentation as required. The provision

would further allow for a national security waiver to be granted,
with the stipulation that the Secretary of Defense would be re-
quired to provide notice to the congressional defense committees
within 10 days of exercising any such waiver.
Sec. 1504—Blast damage assessment guide for space vehicles
at Air Force launch complexes
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Air Force to publish a liquid oxygen (LOX) and
methane blast damage assessment guide for space launch vehicles
using U.S. Air Force launch range complexes within 1 year of the
date of enactment of this act, with a notice and one-time briefing
to the congressional defense committees within 30 days of publica-
tion. The provision would provide for a waiver based on reasons of
national security or impracticability, provided that the Secretary
proposes to the congressional defense committees a one-time alter-
nate date of publication of the LOX-methane blast damage assess-
ment guide.
The committee notes that the provision expresses the commit-
tee’s expectation that the LOX-methane blast damage assessment
guide be developed consistent with section 1601 of the Servicemem-
ber Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
The committee further notes that the provision requires the 1
year date of publication of the LOX-methane blast damage assess-
ment guide will be approximately 2 years since the original re-
quirement, established in section 1601(b) of the Servicemember
Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159), to determine a
process through which a scientifically based yield determination
can be assessed for space launch vehicles while in flight, and that
2 years should provide ample time for the publication of such a
guide, given the heavy demand that is now occurring on U.S. Air
Force launch range complexes.
The committee notes that section 172(h), title 10, United States
Code, delegates such authority to the Commanders of the Space
Launch Deltas responsible for the launch of space flight vehicles.
Therefore, the ability to execute the proposed provision should be
within the purview at a minimum of the Secretary of the Air Force
and more appropriately at the Space Launch Delta in order to com-
ply with the timeframe of the provision.
Sec. 1505—Acquisition of space-based tactical data capa-
bility
The committee recommends a provision that ensures, to the max-
imum extent practicable, that space acquisitions employ procedures
to maximize competition for programs to deliver space-based tac-
tical data and that the products from such vendors comply with
interfaces and standards that maximize resilience and interoper-
ability with Department of Defense systems.

The committee recommends a provision that would direct the Di-
rector of the Space Development Agency to use a middle tier acqui-
sition program for the rapid fielding of satellites and associated
systems for tranches 4, 5, and 6 of the proliferated warfighter
space architecture.
Sec. 1507—Continuation of operation of Defense Meteorolog-
ical Satellite Program
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to continue to operate the Defense Meteorolog-
ical Satellite Program until the end of the functional life of the sat-
ellites in orbit as of the date of the enactment of this Act. The pro-
vision would further direct the Secretary to brief the congressional
defense committees on the status of the program, its requirements
and capabilities, its projected annual and lifecycle costs, and the
projected costs to replace the program’s functions.
Subtitle B—Nuclear Forces
Sec. 1511—Matters relating to intercontinental ballistic mis-
siles of the United States
The committee recommends a provision that would establish a
target date of initial operational capability for the LGM–35A Sen-
tinel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system and
minimum inventory requirements for ICBMs and ICBM launch fa-
cilities. The provision would also prohibit the use of fiscal year
2026 funds to reduce the quantity of deployed ICBMs to a number
less than 400, with exceptions for maintenance, sustainment, or re-
placement.
Sec. 1512—Matters relating to Air Force Global Strike Com-
mand
The committee recommends a provision that would: (1) Reverse
any changes made to Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
manpower, composition, roles, or responsibilities related to efforts
to establish an Integrated Capabilities Office or an Integrated Ca-
pabilities Command (ICC) since October 1, 2023; (2) Limit the ex-
penditure of Air Force funds until the congressional defense com-
mittees are notified of such reversal; (3) Limit the authority of the
Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force
to make future changes to AFGSC without concurrence from the
Secretary of Defense and the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command
(STRATCOM); (4) Make several technical amendments to section
9040 of title 10, United States Code; (5) Codify Air Force Mission
Directive 63; and (6) Require the Secretary of the Air Force to up-
date Air Force Program Action Directive D16–01 within 90 days of
the date of the enactment of this Act.
The committee is deeply troubled by the Air Force’s apparent dis-
regard of the limitations on alterations to AFGSC enacted by sec-
tion 1631 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public

Law 118–159). The Air Force’s failure to fully inform the committee
of plans to ensure that future adjustments to the composition,
roles, or responsibilities of AFGSC will not adversely affect the
command’s capability to meet operational requirements of
STRATCOM or Department of Defense activities to achieve presi-
dential nuclear employment guidance objectives prior to such alter-
ations appear to contravene the clear intent of the provision.
The committee appreciates recent Air Force announcements that
nuclear forces will be exempted from further development of the
ICC until the concept has further matured. The structure of
AFGSC as a four-star major command is a direct result of institu-
tional lapses in senior Air Force leadership in, and inadequate
prioritization of, the nuclear deterrence mission immediately prior
to AFGSC’s elevation. Any efforts to dismantle such organizational
reforms without deliberate review and thoughtful consideration of
the ramifications would indicate to the committee an ignorance of
the causes that led to such failures and risk reducing our con-
fidence in future reform efforts, well-intentioned as they may be.
The committee is adamant that such lapses cannot be allowed to
recur and remains wary of any adjustments to AFGSC’s roles, re-
sponsibilities, or composition that could reduce the prioritization of,
or leadership attention to, this critical capability.
The committee will closely monitor Air Force compliance with the
requirements of this provision and will consider the use of all avail-
able mechanisms in pursuit of this objective, including reviews by
the Government Accountability Office and the Department of De-
fense Inspector General.
Sec. 1513—Adjustment to bomber aircraft nuclear certifi-
cation requirement
The committee recommends a provision that would clarify the
timing for the Air Force to complete operational certification of the
B–21 bomber with the AGM–181 Long Range Standoff Weapon.
Sec. 1514—Limitation on availability of funds pending estab-
lishment of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nu-
clear Deterrence, Chemical, and Biological Defense Pol-
icy and Programs
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 funds for the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and
for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy until the
Department of Defense has: (1) Updated all applicable regulations,
polices, and departmental guidance to reflect the establishment of
the Office of the ASD(NDCBDPP); and (2) Realigned personnel, fa-
cilities, and budgetary resources to reflect the implementation of
section 138(b)(4) of title 10, United States Code.
The committee welcomes the establishment of the position of As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Deterrence, Chemical, and
Biological Defense Policy and Programs (ASD(NDCBDPP)) but re-
mains deeply concerned about the Department of Defense’s ap-
proach to establishing the organization intended to assist the ASD
in carrying out his or her assigned responsibilities. The Depart-
ment’s decision to artificially separate the personnel management

systems for employees formerly assigned to the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Office of the Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S))
undermines the cohesion of the newly established Office of the
ASD(NDCBDPP) and adds unnecessary redundancy and complexity
to the management activities therein. Further, the Department ap-
pears to have failed to reallocate resources and staff expertise from
within the OUSD(A&S) to support the ASD(NDCBDPP)’s statutory
mandate to serve as the ‘‘principal Department of Defense civilian
responsible for oversight of portfolio management for nuclear forces
established by section 499c of [title 10, United States Code]’’. The
Congressional Budget Office recently released a report that esti-
mates the Department of Defense expects to spend approximately
$95.0 billion annually over the next decade to operate, sustain, and
modernize all aspects of the nuclear forces of the United States. In
order to effectively discharge the statutory responsibilities assigned
to it, the OASD(NDCBDPP) must be provided with the expertise
and resourcing required to effectively serve as the ‘‘principal civil-
ian adviser to the Secretary of Defense on nuclear deterrence poli-
cies, operations, and associated programs within the senior man-
agement of the Department of Defense’’. The committee notes that
the primary rationale for establishing the ASD(NDCBDPP) was to
improve collaboration among the various offices within the Office
of the Secretary of Defense with responsibilities relating to the nu-
clear deterrence mission by organically consolidating the various
lines of effort under a unified organization. The Department’s ini-
tial approach to implementing this direction fails to meet this ob-
jective and highlights precisely why Congressional action was re-
quired.
Sec. 1515—Adjustment to responsibilities of Nuclear Weap-
ons Council
The committee recommends a provision that makes a series of
technical adjustments to section 179 of title 10, United States
Code, to further clarify the responsibilities of the Nuclear Weapons
Council.
Sec. 1516—Limitation on availability of funds pending noti-
fication of tasking authority delegation
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 travel funds for the Sec-
retary of the Air Force until the Secretary of Defense submits the
notification required by section 1638(e) of the James M. Inhofe Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law
117–263).
Sec. 1517—Modification of requirement for nuclear-armed,
sea-launched cruise missile initial operational capability
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1640 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to authorize a middle-tier acquisition
pathway and adjust the target date of initial operational capability
for the nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missile from 2034 to
2032.

Congress established section 3602 of title 10, United States Code
(10 U.S.C. 3602), ‘‘Middle tier of acquisition for rapid prototyping
and rapid fielding,’’ as one of six adaptive acquisition pathways for
the Department of Defense to improve the Department’s capability
‘‘to rapidly develop fieldable prototypes to demonstrate new capa-
bilities and meet emerging military needs.’’
The sea launched cruise missile-nuclear (SLCM–N), as author-
ized by section 1640 of the Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Au-
thorization Act, is intended to rapidly deploy a cruise missile using
existing technologies and mature designs as much as possible to re-
duce cost and shorten fielding timelines. As such, the committee
believes the use of a middle-tier rapid prototyping authority found
in 10 U.S.C. 3602 has the potential to support the objectives of the
SLCM–N program.
Therefore, the committee directs the Government Accountability
Office to assess the effectiveness of this authority, and any related
authorities, in supporting the objectives of the SLCM–N program
and brief the congressional defense committees, not later than
March 31, 2026, on the results of this assessment and offer rec-
ommendations for improving its utilization for this ongoing effort.
Sec. 1518—Pilot program for unmanned aerial vehicle re-
supply to launch control facilities
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
Secretary of the Air Force to carry out a pilot program over a pe-
riod of up to 3 years to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of
resupplying intercontinental ballistic missile facilities using un-
manned aircraft systems. The provision further requires the Sec-
retary, should he or she carry out said pilot program, to provide an
annual report, not later than December 1 of each year, on how the
pilot program is supporting Air Force Global Strike Command re-
quirements. Finally, the provision requires the Secretary to brief
the congressional defense committees on any statutory adjustments
required to enable or continue the efficient execution of such pro-
gram, not later than 180 days after the Secretary establishes a
pilot program.
Sec. 1519—Limitation on availability of funds pending com-
mencement of annual briefings on implementation of
recommendations by the Congressional Commission on
the Strategic Posture of the United States
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of fiscal year 2026 funds for the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment until
the Under Secretary completes the first annual briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees required by section 1637 of the Serv-
icemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law 118–159).
Sec. 1520—Deep cleaning of launch control centers of the
Air Force Global Strike Command
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
deep cleaning of the underground crew capsules at the three inter-
continental ballistic missile (ICBM) wings every 5 years.

The committee notes that the capsules in some cases are more
than 60 years old, and each crew must spend 24 hours within each
capsule. The Department of Defense’s 2014 Force Improvement
Program required such a deep cleaning, which has since not been
institutionalized. The committee hopes that this provision will help
institutionalize a deep cleaning cycle until such time as the Sen-
tinel ICBM program decommissions and/or replaces the launch con-
trol center and its crew capsule.
Sec. 1521—Limitation on compensation caps
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit any
action to establish or implement a requirement to establish a cap
on reimbursement of compensation and benefits for non-federal em-
ployees under contract with the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration or employees of federally funded research and develop-
ment centers supporting U.S. atomic energy defense activities; the
sustainment and modernization of Department of Defense nuclear
forces; or the development, testing, or fielding of technologies sup-
porting the Golden Dome missile defense architecture.
The committee is concerned that the Office of Management and
Budget’s proposed rule to limit direct compensation is based on an
arbitrary comparison of unrelated factors and imposes unnecessary
restrictions on the capabilities of federally funded research and de-
velopment centers to attract and retain highly qualified technical
personnel at a time when such expertise is in exceptionally high
demand. While the committee supports efforts to ensure costs are
appropriately managed and controlled, actions to address specific
expenditures should be taken within the context of maximizing
overall value of returns on investments of taxpayer dollars. The
committee notes that the Department of Defense and the Depart-
ment of Energy expect to spend potentially hundreds of billions of
dollars over the next decade to operate, sustain, and modernize
U.S. nuclear forces and missile warning and defense capabilities
and does not believe that artificially limiting the ability of either
Department to access critical skill-sets will improve the likelihood
of success in either mission area.
Subtitle C—Missile Defense
Sec. 1531—Matters relating to the Golden Dome missile de-
fense system
The committee recommends a provision that would revise the na-
tional missile defense policy outlined in section 5501 of title 10,
United States Code; require an annual briefing on the development
and deployment of the Golden Dome missile defense system until
it reaches full operational capability; codify the establishment of
the position of Golden Dome for America Direct Reporting Program
Manager; and direct the Director of the Missile Defense Agency to
take such actions as necessary to enter into a contract for the con-
struction of two replacement missile range safety vessels.
The committee recognizes that the development and deployment
of the Golden Dome missile defense system potentially represents
a profound shift in how the United States deters and defends
against missile and aerial threats to the homeland. The committee

understands that, given the purported scale and scope of the Gold-
en Dome system, the requirements, costs, and timing for producing
and fielding the full capability will likely evolve over time. Ensur-
ing this effort successfully delivers the improved defensive capabili-
ties intended will require close cooperation with and oversight by
the Congress.
The committee also directs the Secretary of Defense, acting
through the designated senior defense official or military officer ap-
pointed to lead the development and deployment of the Golden
Dome missile defense system, to provide a one-time briefing to the
congressional defense committees, not later than February 1, 2026,
on: (1) The feasibility of expanding the operational deployment of
Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System emplacements to include Ha-
waii, Alaska, and the continental United States, as well as an iden-
tification of proposed locations, as applicable; (2) An assessment of
the cost-effectiveness of expanding existing Ground-Based Mid-
course Defense system sites and/or constructing additional sites; (3)
An assessment of opportunities for expanding technology exchanges
and collaborative missile defense system development with U.S. al-
lies; (4) A description of the activities required to modernize exist-
ing terrestrial radars, including Cobra Dane, Thule Ballistic Mis-
sile Early Warning System, Upgraded Early Warning Radars in
Greenland and Cape Cod, the Alaska Radar System, and the Pe-
rimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System; (5) An
assessment of desired locations for the construction of a southern
hemisphere-facing missile early warning system, including initial
cost estimates and projected completion timelines, as applicable; (6)
An evaluation of areas where statutory adjustments may substan-
tially improve the affordability and/or accelerate the fielding of the
overall Golden Dome architecture or composite systems; and (7)
Any other issues the Secretary believes relevant.
Sec. 1532—Inclusion of Hawaii and Alaska in plans for Iron
Dome for America
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to ensure that plans, reviews, strategies, and
capabilities to improve the missile defense of the United States also
include improvements for the missile defense of Hawaii and Alas-
ka, in addition to the continental United States, when imple-
menting Executive Order (EO) 14186, titled ‘‘The Iron Dome for
America.’’ The provision would also establish a one-time briefing
requirement for the Secretary of Defense to brief the congressional
defense committees, not later than 90 days after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, on the implementation of EO 14186.
Sec. 1533—Inclusion of air and missile defense in uncon-
strained total munitions requirements

funding for the procurement of the Iron Dome short-range rocket
defense system, David’s Sling Weapon System, and Arrow 3 Upper
Tier Interceptor Program as outlined under the Memorandum of
Agreement between the United States and the Government of
Israel for cooperative missile defense programs.
Sec. 1535—Requirement for Aegis Combat Systems oper-
ationally deployed under United States Indo-Pacific
Command
The committee recommends a provision that removal of the Aegis
Guam Combat System from the Indo-Pacific Command area of re-
sponsibility (currently sited on Guam) shall be consistent with sec-
tion 162(a) of title 10, United States Code, using procedures out-
lined under Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3130.06D
(relating to global force management allocation policies and proce-
dures). The provision would obligate the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to provide a notice to the congressional defense com-
mittees not later than 10 days after the date of commencement of
such removal.
Sec. 1536—Amendments to technical authority of Director of
Missile Defense Agency regarding integrated air and
missile defense activities and programs
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 5531 of title 10, United States Code, by adding ‘‘system-level
architectures’’ to the technical authority of the Missile Defense
Agency.
Sec. 1537—Assessment of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Mis-
sile Defense Test Site
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Director of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to visit
the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Test Site each year until
March 31, 2030, and assess the site and the state of infrastructure
supporting test and evaluation facilities. Further, the provision
would require the director to brief the congressional defense com-
mittees on the findings of the visit not later than 30 days after the
visit. The provision would provide a waiver to delegate the visit to
a senior official within the TRMC.
The committee has made it a priority to visit the Ronald Reagan
Ballistic Missile Test Site on a regular basis to assess conditions
on the ground and believes that TRMC senior staff can only get a
true picture of facility conditions by visiting the site in person.
Sec. 1538—Biennial assessments of the Ronald Reagan Bal-
listic Missile Defense Test Site

(STRATCOM), in consultation with the Commanders, U.S. Space
Command and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and other such combat-
ant commands as appropriate. The assessment would include a
study of the site’s ability to meet the operational and weapon sys-
tem developmental testing needs of the combatant commands, in-
cluding the suitability of garrison infrastructure to support oper-
ations. The provision would further direct the Commander,
STRATCOM, to submit a written assessment to the Secretary of
Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff not later
than February 28 of each even-numbered year following that in
which the biennial assessment is written, beginning in 2028. The
provision would further direct the Secretary to submit the unedited
assessment and any additional views submitted by the Secretary
and/or the Chairman to the congressional defense committees not
later than March 15 of each even-numbered year following the year
in which the biennial assessment is written, beginning in 2028.
Sec. 1539—Limitation on availability of funds for Office of
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment pending commencement of annual brief-
ings on missile defense of Guam
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation and expenditure of not more than 90 percent of the funds
authorized for fiscal year 2026 for operation and maintenance for
the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment until the Under Secretary provides the first annual

Reporting Program Manager for the Golden Dome for America to
accelerate development of autonomous agents to defend against
cruise missiles and unmanned systems.
Sec. 1543—Missile defense testing requirements
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense and the Program Manager for the Golden
Dome system to ensure that a robust testing regime is established
for all interceptors or similar systems used throughout the lifecycle
of the Golden Dome system. The provision would further direct the
Secretary and Program Manager to present detailed test plans to

Subtitle D—Other Matters
Sec. 1551—Independent assessment of the Department of
Defense National Industrial Security Program
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to enter into an agreement with the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to
conduct an independent assessment of the National Industrial Se-
curity Program. Such assessment would be required to be sub-
mitted by the NASEM to the congressional defense committees,
within 1 year of entering the agreement. The provision would also
require the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees on the views of the Secretary with

would also require the Secretary to conduct an assessment of the
feasibility and advisability of subjecting inactive security clear-
ances to continuous vetting and due diligence and to provide a
briefing, not later than June 30, 2026, to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the
findings of the required assessment.
Sec. 1553—Annual review of the Joint Electromagnetic Bat-
tle Management Software Program
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the Department of Defense
(DOD) to enter into a contract with a federally funded research and
development center to review, on an annual basis, the development
of the Joint Electromagnetic Battle Management (EMBM) Software
Program, ending October 1, 2031. The provision would also require
the CIO to brief the congressional defense committees annually,
not later than September 30 of each year through 2031, on the re-
sults of the review.
The committee notes that the EMBM effort is part of the 2021
implementation plan issued by the CIO to ensure that the DOD co-
herently and holistically manages its electromagnetic spectrum op-
erations. The committee believes it is critical for the combatant
commands to have such a planning tool to understand both permis-
sive and non-permissive spectrum environments of the Joint Force.
Sec. 1554—Integration of electronic warfare into Tier 1 and
Tier 2 joint training exercises
The committee recommends a provision that would move section
1091 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) to chapter 25 of title 10,
United States Code, as a new section 500(g) and extend the termi-
nation date from fiscal year 2026 to fiscal year 2030. Additionally,
the provision would require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff to annually brief the congressional defense committees on the
results of the exercises in this provision as it applies to electronic
warfare.
Sec. 1555—Briefings on intercepts of unidentified anoma-
lous phenomena by North American Aerospace Defense
Command and United States Northern Command
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1683(l) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) to include a new element for the
semi-annual briefing requirement to include details on any uniden-

requires the Director to provide a briefing on the implementation
of the security guidance matrix to the Committees on Armed Serv-
ices of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
30 days after the issuance of the consolidated security guidance
matrix.
Sec. 1557—Plan for increasing utility of user activity moni-
toring capabilities
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to submit to the congressional defense com-
mittees a report on increasing the use of user activity monitoring
capabilities on Department of Defense unclassified networks and
systems, not later than June 1, 2026.
Sec. 1558—Support by the 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing to
EA–37B Compass Call Aircraft
The committee recommends a provision that requires the U.S.
Air Force’s 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing to support the EA–37B
Compass Call Aircraft.
The committee notes that the Air Force has begun to produce the
EA–37B Compass Call aircraft to replace the EC–130H Compass
Call aircraft based on a Gulfstream G550 airframe. The committee
further notes, however, that it is not supported by the 350th Spec-
trum Warfare Wing, which was specifically created to support and
provide spectrum warfare capabilities, such as software-in-the-loop
and hardware-in-the-loop, as well as rapid reprogramming of elec-
tronic systems based on a shortened intelligence cycle. This support
to the EA–37B is essential to the mission of the aircraft and is the
fundamental reason the 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing was estab-
lished.
Finally, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to
provide a brief to the congressional defense committees, not later
than March 31, 2026, on the timeframe to implement the provision.
Sec. 1559—Report on the technical collection capabilities of
the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federa-

sion X of Public Law 117–103) by modifying the reporting require-
ments applicable to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.
Sec. 1562—Limitation on the divestment, consolidation, and
curtailment of certain electronic warfare test and eval-
uation activities
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of the Army to provide a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
prior to taking any action to divest, consolidate, or curtail certain
electronic warfare test and evaluation activities.
Sec. 1563—Modification of functions of Electromagnetic
Spectrum Enterprise Operational Lead for Joint Elec-
tromagnetic Spectrum Operations to include dynamic
spectrum sharing technologies
The committee recommends a provision that modifies the func-
tions of the Electromagnetic Spectrum Enterprise Operational Lead
for Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations under section 500e
of title 10, United States Code, to include coordinating test and
evaluation of tactics, techniques, and procedures for dynamic spec-
trum sharing technologies. The provision also requires assessment
of current gaps in testing mechanisms and evaluation of the feasi-
bility of establishing designated virtual testing ranges for dynamic
spectrum sharing technologies.
Sec. 1564—Limitation on modification of certain electro-
magnetic spectrum relied on by Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 488 of title 10, United States Code, to limit the Secretary of
Defense’s authority to modify certain electromagnetic spectrum re-
lied on by the Department of Defense (DOD) until September 30,
2034, or when dynamic spectrum sharing is certified as fully oper-
ational. The provision prohibits modifications to DOD systems op-
erating between 3100–3450 megahertz and 7400–8400 megahertz
unless the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
jointly certify to Congress that such modification would not result
in a loss of capability.

spond to the Executive Order’s explicit direction to accelerate the
deployment of HBTSS.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide the Senate Armed Services Committee a plan, by not later
than December 1, 2025, to field the minimum number of such vehi-
cles to cover five orbital planes. This plan shall include a descrip-
tion of how the Department of Defense shall procure these vehicles.
Advanced manufacturing methods for hypersonic flight bod-
ies
The committee recognizes the need of the services to drive indus-
trial production capacity to quickly meet urgent needs, drive inno-
vation at the speed of battle, and deliver advanced warfighting ca-
pabilities. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of De-
fense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment, to transmit a spend plan and brief the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on
advanced manufacturing practices, including artificial intelligence-
optimized robotic forming as well as additive and subtractive man-
ufacturing, and advanced materials and processing practices for
hypersonic flight bodies that will shorten the time for delivering
these weapon systems.
All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office future plans
The committee commends the All-domain Anomaly Resolution
Office (AARO) for its efforts to provide Congress with analysis of
unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and for its steps to en-
hance coordination and transparency through the public release of
case resolution reports and information papers. The committee be-
lieves this work is critical to ensuring public trust, providing anal-
ysis and credibility to investigations of UAPs, and advancing the
Department of Defense’s ability to detect, analyze, and respond to
anomalous activity across all domains.
As the AARO concludes work on Historical Record Report: Vol-
ume II and advances the GREMLIN sensor suite from research and
development into testing and field demonstration, the committee
affirms that the AARO remains an important focal point for coordi-
nation and execution of the Department’s enduring responsibilities
with respect to UAP inquiry. Sustained investment and strategic
planning are essential to maintaining continuity and mission ac-
complishment.
Therefore, the committee directs the Deputy Secretary of Defense
to brief the congressional defense committees, not later than March
1, 2026, on the strategic vision for the AARO across the Future
Years Defense Plan. The briefing shall include: (1) Priority focus
areas for the next 5 years; (2) Identification of elements within the
Department that may have capabilities or activities that could pro-
vide support to the AARO mission; (3) Anticipated challenges dur-
ing the next 5 years; (4) Projected budgets for the next 5 years that
allow the AARO to continue its role in addressing UAP reports; (5)

Army Indirect Fire Protection Capability High-Power
Microwave program
The committee strongly supports the Army’s ongoing investment
in high-power microwave (HPM) technologies to counter the esca-
lating threat of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to military in-
stallations, assets, and personnel as part of an overall integrated
air and missile defense strategy. The proliferation of UAS—dem-
onstrated by their increasing capability, affordability, and use in
conflicts in Ukraine and the U.S. Central Command area of respon-
sibility—underscores the urgent need for cost-effective, non-kinetic
defense solutions. The committee commends the Army’s efforts, led
by its Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, to evalu-
ate and integrate commercial HPM technologies into the Indirect
Fire Protection Capability High-Power Microwave (IFPC–HPM)
program, delivering prototype systems with residual combat capa-
bility for short-range defense against UAS swarms at fixed and
semi-fixed sites.
The IFPC–HPM program aligns with the National Defense Strat-
egy, the Army Modernization Strategy, and the Under Secretary of
Defense for Research and Engineering’s priority focus areas for di-
rected energy. Recent progress—including technology maturation,
sensor integration, and prototype deployments to overseas loca-
tions—demonstrates the program’s potential to enhance layered air
and missile defense architectures. Unlike kinetic interceptors with
high per-shot costs, HPM offers a scalable, operationally effective
solution to neutralize UAS threats, including swarms, at reduced
expense. The committee recognizes the Army’s collaboration with
private industry as a catalyst for advancing this capability.
To ensure the Army can field IFPC–HPM systems at scale across
domestic and overseas installations, the committee encourages the
Army to transition the program to a program of record as soon as
possible.
Automation of intelligence tipping and cueing
The committee notes the potential for automated tipping and
cueing capabilities to make intelligence collection more effective
and efficient.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later
than March 1, 2026, on the use of automated tipping and cueing
capabilities for intelligence collection by the Department of De-
fense. The briefing should, at a minimum, include the following: (1)
An assessment of ongoing efforts by the Department to automate
tipping and cueing within the Defense Intelligence Enterprise; (2)
Identification of capability shortfalls or gaps in such efforts; (3)
Recommendations for expanding automation capabilities, including
estimated funding requirements; and (4) Any other matters deemed
relevant by the Secretary.

Autonomous Weapons Stations for Strategic Asset Protec-
tion
The committee notes that the rapidly evolving threat posed by
unmanned systems increases the urgency for fielding advanced
counter-unmanned aircraft systems (cUAS) technologies. For exam-
ple, the proliferation of small, unmanned aircraft systems, like first
person view (FPV) drones, presents a significant challenge due to
their low-cost, ease of scalability, and high operational efficiency.
These drones have been shown to be highly effective both in and
out of conflict zones where they have been successfully employed
against military targets, critical infrastructure, and personnel.
Recognizing this urgent threat, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense to accelerate deployment of capabilities that will
support a layered defense posture that includes autonomous cUAS
technologies capable of executing the full kill chain—sense, decide,
and act. These systems should be modular, platform-agnostic, and
interoperable with existing command and control architectures.
The Secretary should also consider cost-effective integration with
legacy weapon systems or scalable effector options to conduct ki-
netic and non-kinetic engagements.
Briefing on Defense Property Accountability System appli-
cability to missile wing vehicles maintained by Air
Force Global Strike Command
The committee notes that the wide range of vehicles used in mis-
sile wing operations at F.E. Warren Air Force Base (AFB),
Malmstrom AFB, and Minot AFB routinely experience mileage and
usage far exceeding any other vehicles in the Air Force. The com-
mittee further notes that maintenance vehicles reach end-of-life
mileage easily exceeding 300,000 miles, much of which occurs in
harsh weather conditions. Given these circumstances, the com-
mittee is concerned that the general standard used in the Defense
Property Accountability System (DPAS) to determine end-of-life ve-
hicle replacement does not adequately account for the unique na-
ture of the vehicles used in missile wing operations.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Director of the Defense
Logistics Agency, in coordination with the Commander of Air Force
Global Strike Command, to provide a one-time briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on:
(1) The sufficiency and appropriateness of the DPAS for assessing
the end of life of high-mileage vehicles used under the command
of the 20th Air Force; and (2) What, if any, modifications should
be made to the DPAS to ensure these high mileage vehicles are re-
placed in a timely manner consistent with their job mission.
Briefing on infrastructure rehabilitation plan for restoring
U.S. Army Garrison—Kwajalein Atoll and the Ronald
Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site
The committee acknowledges a moderate increase in senior-level
Department of Defense attention to the condition of the Ronald
Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site and the United States
Army Garrison—Kwajalein Atoll as a whole. However, the com-
mittee remains deeply concerned that efforts to sustain the various
operational and testing capabilities resident on the atoll remain in-

sufficient to adequately support the programs and organizations
that depend upon the viability of the installation to meet
warfighter requirements. The committee is especially mindful of
the likely substantial growth in these demands as development of
the presidentially directed Golden Dome missile defense initiative
progresses.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army, in
coordination with the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of
the Navy, the Commanders of United States Strategic, Space, and
Indo-Pacific Commands, and the Director of the Test Resource
Management Center, to brief the congressional defense committees,
not later than December 1, 2025, on a comprehensive, prioritized,
and resource-loaded plan for rehabilitating Department of Defense
infrastructure on and around the atoll to meet current and pro-
jected operational and testing requirements.
Briefing on resource-loaded plans for sustaining Minuteman
III until deployment of Sentinel
The committee remains concerned about the Air Force’s capa-
bility to sustain the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Commander, Air Force
Global Strike Command, not later than December 31, 2025, to brief
the congressional defense committees on sustainment plans for the
Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) weapon
system until the Sentinel ICBM reaches full operational capability.
The briefing should provide, at a minimum: (1) Identification of
system, subsystem, and critical component lifecycle sustainment ac-
tivities for support equipment, ground infrastructure, command
and control, and flight systems; (2) An assessment of the capacity—
in terms of personnel and support equipment—of Air Force Global
Strike Command to upload additional warheads onto deployed Min-
uteman III ICBMs within existing planned timelines established by
the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command if directed to do so; (3)
Resourcing plans to address any identified shortfalls; (4) Statutory
adjustments, if any, that can streamline efforts to execute outlined
sustainment and upload plans; and (5) Information on any other
matters the Commander, Air Force Global Strike Command be-
lieves relevant.
Briefing on risks to Global Positioning System and associ-
ated positioning, navigation, and timing services
The committee is concerned by potential vulnerabilities to the
Global Positioning System (GPS) and associated positioning, navi-
gation, and timing services, particularly in the context of a conflict
involving the United States or an attack on a U.S. ally. These capa-
bilities are critical to national security, military operations, and
global infrastructure, and their disruption could have significant
consequences.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than October 1, 2026, on the most likely risks to the
Global Positioning System and associated positioning, navigation,
and timing services in order to ensure a comprehensive under-

standing of these risks and the Department of Defense’s (DOD)
preparedness to address them. The briefing shall include the fol-
lowing elements:
(1) A description of risks posed by a lack of access to the
Global Positioning System and associated positioning, naviga-
tion, and timing services during a potential conflict in which
the United States is involved or in the case of an attack on a
U.S. ally; and
(2) An assessment of each of the following:
(a) The capabilities of competitor countries, including
the People’s Republic of China, to degrade or deny U.S. ac-
cess to the Global Positioning System and associated posi-
tioning, navigation, and timing services during a potential
conflict with the United States or in the case of an attack
on a U.S. ally;
(b) Current DOD efforts to develop or procure tech-
nology or systems to provide redundant global positioning
and positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities, in-
cluding space-based and terrestrial-based efforts; and
(c) The ability of the Resilient Global Positioning System
program of the Space Force to achieve, not later than 10
years after the date of the enactment of this Act, full ca-
pacity to provide Global Positioning System resilience to
existing U.S. satellites.
Briefing on Space Force education and potential center for
orbital warfare
The committee notes that in March 2025, Space Force published
a seminal document entitled ‘‘Space Warfighting: A Framework for
Planners’’ that establishes the basic principles for the use of mili-
tary power in space and defines a common strategic framework for
the force to achieve space superiority. The committee notes that, in
the foreword to this document, Space Force’s Chief of Space Oper-
ations stresses the importance of Guardians ‘‘at every level’’ being
educated and trained to carry out the force’s mission in accordance
with the framework.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chief of Space Operations
to brief the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed-
upon date, but not later than March 31, 2026, on the extent to
which professional military education for Space Force Guardians
addresses the elements of ‘‘Space Warfighting: A Framework for
Planners.’’
Further, the committee directs that the briefing shall assess the
feasibility and advisability of establishing a dedicated Center for
Orbital Warfare as part of achieving space superiority within the
context of the Framework document. This assessment shall detail:
(1) The benefits to the United States and our allies and partners
of advancing the knowledge of matters relating to orbital warfare,
including cybersecurity, electronic warfare, astro-geography,
sustainment, maneuver, tactically responsive space systems, and
emerging technology; (2) All relevant policy guidance from the Of-
fice of the Secretary of Defense; (3) Appropriate liaison relation-
ships with the geographic and functional combatant commands,
other Department of Defense stakeholders, and other government

and nongovernment entities and organizations; (4) An estimate of
the operational costs of such a center; (5) Potential partnership op-
portunities with U.S. allies and partners for collaboration and bur-
den sharing; and (6) Whether such a center would require legisla-
tion to be established.
Briefing on U.S. Navy nuclear propulsion plant trainer
The committee believes that there may be utility in the fielding
of a full-scale, immersive, hands-on nuclear propulsion plant simu-
lator to instruct officers and enlisted sailors in the operation and
maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants at the Navy’s Nu-
clear Power Training Unit. The committee further believes that
such a simulator could augment existing training methods, poten-
tially making training more flexible and less expensive for the
Navy.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 1, 2026, on: (1) The feasibility of fielding
a full-scale nuclear propulsion plant simulator; (2) The ways in
which such a simulator could augment existing training methods;
(3) Any cost savings associated with such a simulator; and (4) In-
dustry capabilities to develop a simulator.
Commercial ground stations
The committee encourages the Department of Defense to execute
efforts to enhance resilience and redundancy in military satellite
communications (MILSATCOM).
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense,
through the Enterprise Satellite Communication Management and
Control group, to assess how commercial ground-segment capabili-
ties can be integrated into existing MILSATCOM infrastructure
and to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the assessment. The briefing
should include strategies for commercial ground-segment integra-
tion that: (1) Leverage existing commercial ground infrastructure
for rapid offloading of MILSATCOM traffic, increasing resilience,
reducing vulnerability, and lowering operational costs; (2) Use
digitized and virtualized satellite communication management ar-
chitectures, employing modular, low-impact standards to enable
rapid waveform upgrades and network reconfigurations to main-
tain interoperability; and (3) Establish centralized management
procedures and security requirements, allowing commercial pro-
viders to deliver compliant services aligned with operational needs
and warfighter objectives.
Commercial Satellite Bus Integration
The committee recognizes the growing threat posed by adversary
counterspace capabilities, particularly those developed and de-
ployed by China and Russia. In response, the U.S. Space Force is
pursuing resilient and proliferated space architectures. However,
the committee is concerned that current acquisition strategies are
not fully leveraging the domestic commercial industrial base, which
is capable of producing configurable, commoditized satellite buses
at scale. These commercially available solutions have the potential

to reduce program cost and schedule risk by eliminating govern-
ment-funded, non-recurring engineering efforts, while also enabling
faster and more agile deployment of space assets.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of the
Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration to provide a brief-
ing to the congressional defense committees, not later than May 1,
2026, on the Department of the Air Force’s plans to incentivize and
increase the acquisition of domestically produced, configurable sat-
ellite buses in current and future proliferated satellite architec-
tures. The briefing shall include: (1) An analysis of the benefits and
challenges of identifying domestically produced, configurable sat-
ellite buses as a weighted source selection criterion in proliferated
space architecture acquisition programs; (2) A prioritized list of
mission areas suitable for proliferated satellite architectures and
an assessment of industrial base capacity to support these require-
ments; and (3) An evaluation of current acquisition policies, au-
thorities, and practices that incentivize the reduction of non-recur-
ring engineering costs to the Department of the Air Force for sat-
ellite bus modification within proliferated space architectures.
Commercial space domain awareness
The committee is aware that, according to the Department of De-
fense’s (DOD) annual report to the Congress on China’s military
and security developments, China launched over 200 satellites in
2023 alone. More than 360 Chinese satellites are believed to sup-
port intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.
Although Russia’s growth in space-based ISR is not as rapid, it re-
mains a significant concern. As the space domain becomes increas-
ingly contested, the committee underscores the strategic impor-
tance of leveraging commercial space-based and ground-based ob-
servation systems to enhance the DOD’s monitoring and assess-
ment capabilities.
Commercial space capabilities offer rapid innovation, lower costs,
and scalable access to persistent data that can augment DOD ef-
forts to detect, track, and characterize foreign ISR assets. By using
commercial observation platforms to the maximum extent prac-
ticable, the committee believes the Department can reduce reliance
on limited government-owned resources and improve resilience
across its space domain awareness architecture.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later
than March 31, 2026. The briefing shall include: (1) An assessment
of current and projected Chinese and Russian space-based ISR ca-
pabilities; (2) An overview of DOD monitoring efforts, including the
current and planned use of commercial systems; and (3) Rec-
ommendations for expanding the Department’s integration of com-
mercial capabilities to enhance space domain awareness, ISR detec-
tion, tracking, and mitigation strategies.
Comptroller General assessment of coordination with allies
on national security space acquisitions

serve warfighters in a large variety of ways, including providing
protected communications, missile warning and tracking data, and
enabling battlespace awareness. In many areas of the national se-
curity space, the Department has close working relationships with
allies, and it shares information and resources in some cases. The
Department also has multiple strategies and policies that empha-
size the importance of relationships with allies and coordination
with them on space activities. In the past, the Department has had
allies as financial partners in developing space programs, which
served to decrease development costs for the Department, among
other benefits. The committee notes, however, this type of partner-
ship is not common.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The extent to which the Department
is partnering with allies on acquisitions of national security space
capabilities; (2) How the Department identifies and assesses oppor-
tunities for these partnerships, including any cost sharing agree-
ments; and (3) The risks and benefits of these partnerships.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General assessment of Department of Defense
program protection for space acquisition programs
The committee notes that the Department of Defense has estab-
lished various program protection-related policies and processes to
ensure that the Department is developing or acquiring systems
which are protected from cyber, physical, and other threats. The
committee further notes that the importance of these measures
cannot be overstated. Considering a dynamic threat environment,
the accelerating rate of technological change, and the increasing
importance of the space domain, the committee is concerned about
the ability of program offices to address dynamic threats effec-
tively.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The Department’s policies and proc-
esses, such as for the development and execution of program pro-
tection plans, which address protective measures to address cyber,
physical, and other threats for space systems being developed or
acquired; (2) How space system acquisition program offices
prioritize implementation of program protective measures versus
cost and schedule; and (3) The extent to which the most current
data and intelligence is used by program offices to inform program
protection planning and execution decisions.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives at a mutually agreed upon date, not later
than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a mutually agreed
upon format and timeframe. The committee further directs the
Comptroller General to advise the committee of any identified bar-

Comptroller General review of electromagnetic spectrum
needs during defense acquisition process
The committee notes that the electromagnetic radio frequency
spectrum is critical to the development and operation of a variety
of military systems such as radios, radars, and satellites. The com-
mittee understands that due to the changing nature of warfighting,
more and more military systems depend on spectrum to detect and
identify threats using advanced technologies, guide precision weap-
ons, and obtain information superiority. At the same time, the com-
mittee notes that demand for spectrum has increased with ad-
vances in commercial technology. This demand has led to competi-
tion between government and nongovernment users, making spec-
trum management vital to prevent harmful interference and to pro-
mote spectrum efficiency. The Department of Defense (DOD) has
policy and guidance documents that require the DOD to consider
spectrum needs during the acquisition lifecycle.
The committee notes that, in 2003, the Government Account-
ability Office found that DOD weapon programs often failed to ob-
tain, consider, or act upon adequate spectrum supportability knowl-
edge during the early stages of acquisition (‘‘Spectrum Manage-
ment in Defense Acquisitions’’, April 30, 2003, GAO–03–617R). The
committee is concerned that if the DOD is not intentionally and ac-
tively managing spectrum needs early in the acquisition lifecycle,
subsequent modifications could be excessively costly and could have
operational impacts, since those systems could remain in the
DOD’s arsenal for decades, when spectrum is expected to become
even more contested and congested than it is today.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) Whether other Executive Branch agen-
cies are providing sufficient guidance and information to the DOD
so that it has the necessary information to make spectrum manage-
ment decisions early in the acquisition lifecycle; (2) Whether the
DOD is implementing its spectrum management policy and guid-
ance documents; (3) Whether the DOD has a process to obtain, con-
sider, and act upon adequate spectrum supportability knowledge
during the early stages of an acquisition; and (4) Any other matters
the Comptroller General determines to be relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to the
congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon date,
not later than April 1, 2026, with final report to follow in a mutu-
ally agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of electromagnetic spectrum
operations
The committee notes that, in October 2020, the Department of
Defense (DOD) issued its Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) Superi-

across the Department to support core national security objectives
while remaining mindful of the importance of U.S. economic pros-
perity. The committee further notes that the National Defense Au-

thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) included
a provision that required the Secretary of Defense, in coordination
with the Chief Information Officer, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of each of the military depart-
ments, to submit to the congressional defense committees an an-
nual report on the EMS Superiority Strategy of the Department.
However, the Government Accountability Office has previously re-
ported and testified that Department has not implemented its two
prior spectrum strategies (‘‘Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations:
DOD Needs to Address Governance and Oversight Issues to Help
Ensure Superiority,’’ December 10, 2020, GAO–21–64), despite rec-
ognition that near-peer countries were developing capabilities that
could undermine our national security.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller General of
the United States to assess: (1) The extent to which the DOD has
implemented its EMS Superiority Strategy; (2) Whether there are
accomplishments from the DOD’s implementation of the strategy;
(3) Whether the DOD has identified challenges in implementing
the strategy and, if so, taken steps to overcome the challenges; (4)
The extent to which the annual report complies with the require-
ments of section 502 of title 10, United States Code; and (5) Any
other matters the Comptroller General determines to be relevant.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to the
congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon date,
not later than April 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a mutu-
ally agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of performance of the Logistics
Civil Augmentation Program contracting structure in
supporting U.S. Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll
The committee recognizes the importance of vital military assets
at Kwajalein Atoll and notes with concern the degraded state of
supporting assets and infrastructure critical to their operation.
Accordingly, to assist the committee in its oversight of these as-
sets, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the United
States to conduct a review and provide a briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon time, not
later than March 1, 2026. The Comptroller General’s review should
assess: (1) The roles and responsibilities of U.S. Army Garrison
Kwajalein Atoll and its civilian contractors, including those man-
aged under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, in operating
and maintaining the supporting assets and infrastructure at the in-
stallation, to include power and cooling plants, stores, clinics, and
the garrison school; and (2) Department of Defense actions to ad-
dress challenges related to sustainment of key infrastructure on
Kwajalein Atoll.

Space Development Agency (SDA) plans to collect, integrate, and
disseminate data and products to the warfighter and broader com-
munity through its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture
(PWSA), which is predicated on an autonomous ground segment.
Accordingly, given the critical nature of this capability for na-
tional security and the DOD’s longstanding practice of launching
satellites before ground systems are fully operational, the com-
mittee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to as-
sess: (1) How the SDA is ensuring that the ground system will be
available to fully enable the proliferated and networked space-
based architecture; (2) The extent to which SDA is integrating,
processing, and disseminating the data that supports resilient mis-
sile warning and missile tracking; and (3) The extent to which the
SDA’s acquisitions address the needs of the warfighter and broader
community, including emerging needs in response to changing
threats.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
The committee further directs the DOD to provide the Comp-
troller General full access to any relevant information for this re-
view and directs the Comptroller General to advise the committee
of any identified barrier in conducting this work.
Comptroller General review of Space Fence program chal-
lenges
The committee notes the Space Fence ground-based radar was
developed to support the Space Force’s mission of tracking and cat-
aloging objects in multiple orbits. Space Fence was intended to
greatly enhance Space Force’s ability to identify and track smaller
objects on orbit and has greatly increased the amount of space situ-
ational awareness data available to the Department of Defense.
The committee further notes that during testing and in operations,
Space Fence experienced significant issues with the performance of
its hardware due to contamination of the water source used to cool
the radar. These issues threaten to shut down the radar, which
cost over $1.0 billion to develop.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess the extent to which DOD has identified and
addressed infrastructure and sustainment challenges that may be
inhibiting Space Fence readiness, including potential cost implica-
tions.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on its find-
ings at a mutually agreed upon date, not later than May 1, 2026.
Comptroller General review of space systems data net-
working capabilities
The committee notes that in recent years, the Department of De-
fense has taken steps to develop a wide range of new space-based
capabilities, including constellations that are intended to commu-
nicate within and across multiple orbits to satisfy a range of mis-

sion needs throughout the Department. To support the increasing
complexity of these space capabilities, the Department is devel-
oping various networking capabilities. The committee believes,
however, it is unclear whether networking efforts are sufficiently
synchronized with the development of space-based systems for this
new and dynamic environment.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) Steps the Department is taking to de-
velop the necessary infrastructure, hardware, and software to sup-
port networking requirements across various space-based legacy
systems and systems currently in development; and (2) The extent
to which the Department coordinates across various systems to en-
sure their resiliency and interoperability with respect to, among
other things, network architecture and protocols.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
The committee believes that in order to facilitate the Govern-
ment Accountability Office’s (GAO) efforts, it is necessary to ensure
timely access to program information including but not limited to
cost, schedule, and budget information, program management re-
ports, and risk and technology readiness assessments. Given the
classified nature of some of the information, GAO is directed to ad-
vise the committee of any assistance GAO personnel will need to
secure access to information related to this review.
Cybersecurity for space assets
The committee notes that the cybersecurity of the control net-
work for satellite operations is of paramount importance, given the
attack vectors associated with the number of ground stations and
satellite apertures.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to brief the congressional defense committees, not later than March
31, 2026, on the cybersecurity of the Air Force Satellite Control
Network (AFSCN). In particular, the briefing should evaluate prin-
cipal locations, such as Schriever Space Force Base, locations in the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area of responsibility, and other such
sites as appropriate. The briefing should assess: (1) Recent cyber
stress testing of the network to assess its effectiveness and resil-
ience; (2) The presence and effectiveness of cyber event detection
capabilities in both information and operational technologies sup-
porting AFSCN operations; (3) The capability of forces assigned to
AFSCN facilities to respond to and recover from cyber attacks on
critical information and operational technologies; (4) The ability of
defensive cyber forces under U.S. Cyber Command to provide time-
ly and expert information technology and operational technology
defensive operations to ensure the wartime functionality of AFSCN
sites; (5) The level of support required from civilian and contractor
entities responsible for defending critical cyber assets; and (6) The
recovery processes needed to ensure the AFSCN can function and
support contingency operations.

Further, the committee directs that the briefing give rec-
ommendations with respect to enhancing cyber detection, response,
and recovery capabilities at AFSCN sites, accounting for both
peacetime and wartime operational requirements as well as the
feasibility and advisability of a lessons learned repository for both
peacetime and wartime cyber stress testing exercises.
Demonstrate leveraging commercial in-space data pur-
chases and analysis for unresolved imagery for Space
Domain Awareness
The committee recognizes the growing importance of leveraging
commercial capabilities to enhance national security in space. To
that end, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force, not
later than March 31, 2026, to brief the congressional defense com-
mittees on the feasibility and advisability of a study on using
ground-based and in-space commercial data and analytics to cap-
ture and exploit unresolved imagery collected by existing assets in
geostationary orbit (GEO). The study would demonstrate how com-
mercial data and analytics can be used to realize the value of unre-
solved imagery in GEO to increase space situational awareness and
defense capabilities. Results from this initial study would be used
in a demonstration mission where the unresolved commercial data
is leveraged to tip and cue Space Domain Awareness satellites, an
efficient and cost-effective solution to ensure greater early warning
of adversary space activities that could eventually expand to utilize
additional in-space sensors for observation and data collection as
the satellites’ secondary mission set.
Directed energy weapons
The committee is concerned about the Department of Defense’s
continued unwillingness to adequately invest in directed energy
weapons and its apparent lack of commitment to effectively ad-
vancing these technologies. The committee has received consistent
testimony regarding the potential value that directed energy weap-
ons have in supplementing integrated air and missile defenses. The
committee has further received testimony regarding the imbalances
in air warfare in terms of budget and inventory, and it is clear the
United States does not have sufficient inventory or budget to be
able to engage salvos of missiles and unmanned systems solely
with kinetic interceptors. The committee notes that the fiscal year
2026 budget from the Department lacks the clarity in resources
and planning to meet the needs in integrated air and missile de-
fense. The committee strongly encourages the Department to con-
sider the benefits of directed energy systems as part of the admin-
istration’s Golden Dome plans and in developing integrated air and
missile defense weapons and platforms.
The committee further directs the Under Secretary of Defense for
Research & Engineering, in coordination with the Direct Reporting
Program Manager for Golden Dome for America and the Director
of the Missile Defense Agency, to provide the congressional defense
committees with a briefing, not later than December 1, 2025, on a
strategy for comprehensively expanding the Department’s invest-
ments in the development of directed energy weapons over the next
Future Years Defense Program.

Dynamic robotic servicing in space
The committee notes that the development of robotic systems in
space for servicing or refueling satellites is of key importance for
the longevity of space systems. Potential applications of robotic sys-
tems include: (1) Disposing of derelict satellites to prevent colli-
sions that generate space debris; (2) Upgrading satellites in situ,
instead of replacing them, to save taxpayer dollars; (3) Refueling
satellites so they can stay in orbit; and (4) Returning science pay-
loads or manufactured goods to Earth by robotically retrieving and
berthing them in a reentry system vehicle.
The committee believes that, at present, the satellite servicing
industry is nascent. There are no widely accepted standards for re-
fueling or docking interfaces, and there have been few demonstra-
tions of such interfaces in space. Of note, China has already dem-
onstrated a robotic spacecraft to tug satellites into graveyard orbits
approximately 300 kilometers past geostationary orbit. The com-
mittee also notes with concern that Chinese investment in in-space
robotics currently outstrips that of the United States.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the feasibility of utilizing
existing Department of Defense expertise in space robotics to deter-
mine whether using a robotic system can capture the Vanguard-1
spacecraft and return it to Earth for display.
The committee notes that Vanguard-1 is the oldest manmade ob-
ject in orbit and constitutes a historically and scientifically valu-
able object. Developing the ability to robotically grapple and manip-
ulate objects in space and return them to Earth would be a high-
profile demonstration of the United States’ scientific expertise and
would help lay the groundwork for routine manufacturing of medi-
cines, industrial crystalline materials, and other valuable materials
in microgravity. The committee believes that executing such a mis-
sion would advance a multitude of technologies that could benefit
the U.S. industrial base in a variety of mission areas.
Electromagnetic warfare and spectrum operations man-
power
The committee notes there has been increased attention to elec-
tromagnetic warfare and spectrum operations (EMSO) as a result
of great power competition. The committee further notes that the
Joint Staff has created a Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Oper-
ations Center to drive spectrum operations planning cells at each
of the combatant commands. Furthermore, section 1091 of the
James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) requires that any tier one exercise
by a combatant command incorporate EMSO planning and that
EMSO is codified as a Joint Force mission in chapter 25 of title 10,
United State Code.
In response to the increasing importance of this domain of war-
fare, the U.S. Air Force has increased its emphasis on EMSO, first
by establishing the 350th Spectrum Operations Wing in 2021 and
then, in December 2023, establishing EMSO doctrine (‘‘Electro-
magnetic Spectrum Operations,’’ Air Force Doctrine Publication 3–
85). However, the committee understands that the U.S. Air Force

has yet to undertake a holistic review of a career field for personnel
planning that integrates EMSO into fully developed doctrine, orga-
nization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel,
and facilities.
Accordingly, not later than February 28, 2026, the committee di-
rects the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a one-time report to
the congressional defense committees with a long-term plan to es-
tablish a career field in EMSO for both air and space operations.
The plan should inventory all career fields within the U.S. Air and
Space Forces performing the EMSO mission set and develop a
strategy to integrate, manage, and train airmen and guardians,
both enlisted and officer, on EMSO.
Electronic warfare requirements and testing for Group 1–3
unmanned aerial systems and loitering munitions
The committee is concerned by the Department of Defense’s cur-
rent posture regarding the survivability and operational effective-
ness of Group 1 through Group 3 unmanned aerial systems (UAS)
and loitering munitions in contested electromagnetic environments.
In particular, the committee notes the demonstrated effectiveness
of Russian electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, including Global
Positioning System (GPS) and Radio Frequency (RF) jamming,
against U.S.-supplied Group 1–3 UAS and loitering munitions oper-
ating in Ukraine. These adversary electronic warfare threats high-
light critical vulnerabilities in current Department-fielded systems
and underscore the necessity of resilient UAS platforms capable of
executing mission requirements in RF- and GPS-denied environ-
ments.
The committee is further concerned that the Department has not
established a consistent baseline for operational performance in
contested EW environments for Group 1–3 UAS and loitering mu-
nitions. In addition, there appears to be an absence of a systematic
process for incorporating emerging EW threat intelligence into re-
quirements development, system design, or testing protocols. The
committee believes that the Department must implement a live,
virtual, and constructive test and evaluation regime that ade-
quately reflects the evolving EW threat landscape and that informs
the requirements and procurement decisions for these systems.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than December 31,
2025, on the Department’s current capabilities, requirements, and
testing standards to ensure the effective employment of Group 1–
3 UAS and loitering munitions in contested EW environments. The
briefing shall include the following: (1) A description of any existing
Department or military service requirements related to Group 1–
3 UAS and loitering munitions operations in RF- and GPS-denied
environments; (2) Minimum performance standards or required ca-
pabilities for these systems in such environments; (3) A list and de-
scription of any assessment mechanisms used to evaluate adver-
sary RF- and GPS-jamming capabilities, and how these assess-
ments are integrated into UAS and loitering munitions require-
ments development and acquisition processes; and (4) An overview
of the live, virtual, and constructive EW testing regimes for Group

1–3 UAS and loitering munitions, including how these testing ef-
forts incorporate the threat assessments referenced above and in-
form capability requirements.
The committee expects this briefing to inform future oversight of
DOD’s investments in tactical UAS and loitering munition capabili-
ties and their survivability in modern conflict environments.
Encouraging investment in deep space telescopes
The committee notes that radio telescopes such as the National
Radio Astronomy Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Tel-
escope provide unique capabilities for deep space situational aware-
ness. The committee believes these federally funded radio tele-
scopes and data acquisition systems provide key navigation and
tracking information and that these are unique national security
applications utilized by the Department of Defense.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the Department to invest
in the design and planning of important new updates to these tele-
scopes such as the Next-Generation VLA and the Green Bank Tele-
scope system.
Extended life operations for U.S. Government satellites
The committee understands that end-of-life satellites are dis-
posed of every year as they are replaced with newer satellite con-
stellations. These end-of-life satellites may have significant mission
utility to support operations and training but are being disposed of
due to insufficient funding and staffing to operate the new and the
older constellations simultaneously. The committee further under-
stands that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s Polar Operational Environmental Satellites and the Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency’s Blackjack constellations both
currently operate a commercial model of operating Government sat-
ellites as a service.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
not later than March 31, 2026, to provide a briefing that: (1) As-
sesses how many satellites are disposed of annually; and (2) Com-
pares the costs and benefits of continuing to extract mission value
from older satellites by operating the satellites by a commercial en-
tity versus disposing of these satellites.
High-resolution three-dimensional geospatial data
The committee recognizes the importance of unclassified,
shareable high-resolution three-dimensional (HR3D) geospatial
data in support of Department of Defense operations, activities by
other elements of the U.S. Government, and international partners.
The committee understands that the Army Geospatial Center’s
HR3D program has successfully mapped over 4.3 million square
kilometers globally across more than 45 countries, providing essen-
tial geospatial information that enhances force positioning, mission
planning, and coalition effectiveness in key operational theaters.
The committee notes with concern that despite the abundance of
unclassified geospatial data in existence, there lacks a single custo-
dian based on geography, service, or agency. Additionally, geo-
graphic combatant commanders currently maintain separate proc-
esses for collecting geospatial data with a disproportionate empha-

sis on classified collection, which can result in inefficiencies and
missed opportunities in shaping operations in Phase 0 or Phase 1
operating environments. The committee emphasizes that shareable
HR3D data provides a foundation on which other data sources can
be layered and is uniquely positioned to support the changing secu-
rity environment with greater emphasis on operations in the com-
petitive space, including Phase 0 and Phase 1 operations.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to sub-
mit a report, not later than May 31, 2026, to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
that includes, at a minimum, the following: (1) A description of any
plans to sustain and expand the existing shareable HR3D program
capabilities, with particular emphasis on the Army Geospatial Cen-
ter’s BuckEye program, including a description of resourcing re-
quirements, organizational responsibilities, and anticipated
timelines for any such plan; (2) An assessment of the anticipated
benefits of implementing a Global Foundation Layer (GFL) require-
ments generation process and organizational structure to coordi-
nate geospatial data collection, integration, and dissemination
across each geographic combatant command, service, and agency;
(3) An assessment of opportunities to combine shareable HR3D
data with other unclassified data sets to enable blended analysis
and production; and (4) Any other matters deemed relevant by the
Secretary.
Integrated sensing roadmap for unidentified anomalous
phenomena
The committee notes the scientific and technical challenges in in-
vestigating, identifying, and validating unidentified anomalous
phenomena (UAP). Aside from the credibility gaps that exist in
some communities following this issue, there is a significant tech-
nical challenge to trying to collect necessary scientific and signa-
ture data for something that is inherently unknown and might ap-
pear unpredictably in location and time. To date, investigations
have relied primarily on eyewitness accounts or from sympathetic
sensors of various types that may have happened to be collecting
at the right time and place to capture evidence of some unknown
phenomena.
The committee is aware that the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution
Office (AARO) was established to investigate UAPs and to try to
develop definitive scientific evidence to help resolve these unknown
cases. The committee is also aware that the AARO has been invest-
ing in a set of sensors focused on airborne UAPs, but, as noted in
its annual report to Congress, gaps still exist in the sensing of
space, maritime surface, and maritime subsurface domains. Addi-
tionally, the ability to correlate data from these domains into a sin-
gle picture for analysis by the AARO does not currently exist.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the AARO to de-
velop an integrated sensing roadmap and to provide a briefing to
the Senate Armed Services Committee, not later than August 1,
2026. Such roadmap should include the following: (1) A framework
for sensing needs and gaps for space, maritime surface, and mari-
time subsurface domains; (2) An assessment of available sensors
for each of those domains; (3) Challenges to developing an inte-

grated picture across those domains; (4) The ability to integrate
sympathetic collection of other sensors available during data collec-
tion events; and (5) An assessment of resources needed to address
any gaps or challenges identified by the roadmap.
Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor acquisition
The committee strongly supports accelerated integrated air and
missile defense (IAMD) modernization but understands that the
Army has not committed to supporting any partner procurement of
the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) system
unless there is parallel procurement of the Integrated Battle Com-
mand System.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
provide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the following subjects: (1)
Potential adjustments to the LTAMDS acquisition strategy, includ-
ing advance procurement of up to three battalions of radars per
year and the use of multi-year procurement to achieve a higher an-
nual production rate; (2) Possible annual savings associated with
bundling partner procurement of LTAMDS over the period of the
multi-year; and (3) An operational summary of how procurement of
LTAMDS at full rate to meet global demand would enhance IAMD
in the U.S. European, Central, and Indo-Pacific Commands’ areas
of responsibility.
Modernizing mission assurance for space launch
The committee reaffirms the importance of robust mission assur-
ance requirements for national security space launches. Histori-
cally, these requirements have been shaped by factors such as lim-
ited order quantities, demanding orbital parameters, complex cus-
tom integration needs, and the sensitive nature of national security
missions. However, this one-size-fits-all approach, often costly and
burdensome, has been uniformly applied across all national secu-
rity launches, despite the existence of multiple launch programs
that are designed with varying risk profiles aligned to specific mis-
sion objectives.
While the National Security Space Launch program has made
progress under Phase 3 to adopt more tailored, modern mission as-
surance standards in line with current industry practices, other
programs, such as the Orbital Services Program and the Sounding
Rocket Program, continue to operate under outdated and unneces-
sarily rigid frameworks. The committee believes that these pro-
grams play critical roles in supporting military capabilities and
would significantly benefit from a more flexible, agile mission as-
surance structure that reflects their distinct operational purposes.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Chief of Space Operations
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than September
30, 2025, detailing how the Space Force will modernize mission as-
surance requirements across its launch programs. This moderniza-
tion plan must include: (1) A specific timeline, responsible offices,
and measurable milestones for implementing modernized mission
assurance requirements for experimental, test, prototype, and oper-
ational payloads in all Assured Access to Space launch programs,

including the Orbital Services Program and Sounding Rocket Pro-
gram; and (2) A process for updating mission assurance require-
ments on a regular basis as launch cadence increases and more
launch providers are onboarded into Space Force managed launch
contracts.
Multi-use commercial communications for deep space mis-
sions
The committee strongly supports operationally relevant capabili-
ties and infrastructure for secure command and control and posi-
tion, navigation, and timing throughout cislunar space and encour-
ages the Secretary of the Air Force to increase investments in this
area. Further, the committee encourages the Secretary to develop
a coordinated program for commercial cislunar and deep space com-
munications services to augment the existing National Aeronautics
and Space Administration’s Deep Space Network and to meet U.S.
Government requirements for commercial, civil, and national secu-
rity space missions. The program should maximize commercial
models, such as public-private partnerships, to leverage innovative
technologies and approaches to reduce the costs and development
schedules of traditional deep space communication systems.
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
The committee believes the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency’s (NGA) Maven Program is critical to the United States’
ability to provide state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) capabili-
ties including, but not limited to, the current computer vision and
generative AI efforts. Such capabilities are important for rapidly
detecting, identifying, characterizing, extracting, and attributing
features and objects in imagery and video data sets at the speed
of crisis and conflict.
The committee urges the Director of the NGA to ensure that the
Maven Program continues to: (1) Operate with agility and speed;
(2) Support a competitive development and collaboration method-
ology; (3) Structure as open architecture with both platform and
enterprise engineering infrastructure across U.S. Government na-
tional security systems and classification domains; (4) Enable open
and fair participation from the entire national defense industrial
base; and (5) Ensure operational continuity from the strategic to
the tactical levels.
Further, the committee believes flexible, adaptive contracts could
enable the Maven Program to rapidly execute AI research and de-
velopment and adapt to changes in the global threat environment.
The committee further believes the Maven Program should con-
tinue its focus on sourcing from the best and brightest companies
from the national defense industrial base, regardless of size and
maturity, which would increase competition and provide the best
products and services to the Department of Defense.
Non-propulsive orbital maneuvering technologies
The committee supports continued development of maneuver
technologies that reduce reliance on consumable propulsion. As the
Department of Defense expands activity in low earth orbit (LEO)
and plans for cislunar operations, it must pursue mobility solutions

that avoid burdensome fuel logistics and enhance survivability.
Electromechanical deployment platforms offer energy-efficient ways
to reposition space assets for key space superiority missions while
improving endurance and enabling new economic benefits in the
space domain.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in coordination with the Chief of Space Operations and the Director
of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to submit a re-
port to the congressional defense committees, not later than March
1, 2026, assessing the feasibility, utility, integration potential, and
barriers to operational use of non-propulsive maneuver tech-
nologies. A classified annex may be included.
Ongoing Comptroller General review of Minuteman III
intercontinental ballistic missile operations and
sustainment
The committee notes that in 2021, the Air Force reported that
the Department of Defense (DOD) planned to retire the Minuteman
III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system when the re-
placement system, Sentinel, reached full operational capability in
2036. However, in early 2024, the committee notes that the DOD
reported that the Sentinel program had experienced a Nunn-
McCurdy breach triggered by critical cost overruns. The program
also faces significant schedule delays that will likely require the
Air Force to continue operating the Minuteman III system far
longer than planned. Consequently, the committee is concerned
about the Air Force’s ability to sustain the aging Minuteman III
system through the transition to Sentinel. In May 2025, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) completed a review of current
preparations to transition from Minuteman III to Sentinel and
made recommendations to use the time provided by the delay to in-
crease the Air Force’s focus on risks (‘‘ICBM Modernization: Air
Force Actions Needed to Expeditiously Address Critical Risks to
Sentinel Transition’’ (GAO–25–107048C, May 13, 2025)). Over the
past several years, GAO’s regular reviews of the Sentinel program
have been essential to congressional oversight of this program.
Therefore, to ensure that the committee continues to receive in-
formation on the Minuteman III program and the transition to
Sentinel, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to conduct regular reviews of the operations and
sustainment of the Minuteman III ICBM program through fiscal
year 2030 and to brief the congressional defense committees on a
periodic, mutually agreed upon basis.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to issue
written assessments to the congressional defense committees based
on its regular reviews, as needed by the committees, in formats and
at times to be mutually agreed upon, through fiscal year 2030.
Performance review of security clearance process
The committee is aware that the Department of Defense (DOD)
continues to struggle with a backlog in security clearance investiga-
tions and adjudications that hinders industry, increases risk to the

partment. There are many factors compounding delays, but the
committee believes a comprehensive business process review using
lean six sigma or similar techniques would provide helpful insight
into root causes for these delays. Additionally, the committee be-
lieves an outside review by an entity with experience in these tech-
niques, but not steeped in the business processes or culture of the
security process, could provide fresh perspectives on problems and
possible solutions.
Therefore, the committee directs the Department of Defense Per-
formance Improvement Officer to conduct a review of the DOD se-
curity clearance process and provide a briefing on the results of
that review to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than October 1, 2026.
The review should be focused on finding opportunities to improve
processing timeliness, data to help measure the progress and effec-
tiveness of the program, and reciprocity between defense organiza-
tions. Elements of the review shall focus specifically on examining
data related to: (1) Reciprocity within DOD components and the
interagency; (2) Timelines for security process steps, including de-
veloping a metric for timeliness; and (3) Interoperability of all of
the related systems of record related to security clearance proc-
essing.
Protection and advancement of electronic warfare systems
The committee strongly supports continued growth of the Army
Research Laboratory collaboration with academia in the develop-
ment of technologies that harden and increase the resilience of
electronic warfare systems. The committee further supports
leveraging advancements in directed energy effects, coupled with
electronic warfare approaches, to ensure mission success in a con-
tested, congested battlefield environment. The committee notes
that this is consistent with the Secretary of Defense Memorandum
on Army Transformation and Acquisition Reform, dated April 30,
2025, to achieve electromagnetic and air-littoral dominance by
2027.
Public-private partnerships in nuclear effects testing
The committee notes that the ongoing nuclear modernization ef-
fort, combined with an expansion of our missile defense capability,
has increased the need to modernize our nuclear effects testing ca-
pability, which has been slow to keep pace. The committee further
notes that most facilities that provide this capability were designed
in the 1980s and need a technical refresh. Furthermore, many of
the facilities are in high demand, with long waiting queues for
component- and system-level testing. In addition, the industrial
base for this field of technology has shrunk considerably.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Department of Defense’s
Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, in coordination with
the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Administrator for
Nuclear Security, to provide a one-time briefing to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the
following subjects: (1) Any current gaps in radiation effects testing
capacity and any delays in weapon system testing resulting from
a lack of capacity; (2) The status of existing collaboration efforts

with industry on nuclear effects testing; (3) An analysis of the fea-
sibility of establishing a public-private partnership for nuclear ef-
fects testing; and (4) Any other relevant issues the Director or the
Administrator deems necessary.
Satellite hyperspectral imaging
The committee notes that hyperspectral imaging is an advanced
technique that captures and analyzes data across the electro-
magnetic spectrum, enabling the identification of objects and mate-
rials based on their unique spectral signatures at the pixel level.
The committee believes that commercial deployment of this tech-
nology in space holds significant promise to reduce costs to the
Government and expand accessibility through broader adoption
and use.
Therefore, not later than March 31, 2026, the committee directs
the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence,
in coordination with the Directors of the National Geospatial-Intel-
ligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office, to brief the
congressional defense and intelligence committees regarding an as-
sessment of the gaps that could be filled by hyperspectral imagery
capabilities. The briefing should also address how commercial
hyperspectral imagery capabilities could contribute to addressing
existing and future defense and intelligence gaps.
Sea-based launch platforms for ballistic missile defense tar-
gets
The committee recognizes the importance of threat-representa-
tive testing capabilities for ballistic missile defense systems, as
well as challenges inherent to accurately simulating ballistic mis-
sile threats. In particular, the committee is concerned that mission
oversaturation at Cape Canaveral may limit the Navy’s ability to
fully test and evaluate different missiles, including Trident mis-
siles, given the growing space launch cadence and the likely in-
crease in missile defense testing as the Golden Dome project pro-
ceeds. The committee is encouraged by efforts to reconstitute sea-
based launch platforms for ballistic missile targets and encourages
the Secretary of the Navy to prioritize the deployment of such plat-
forms.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary, in coordination
with the Secretary of the Air Force and the Director of the Missile
Defense Agency, to provide a one-time brief to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than November 1, 2025, on the viability
of expanding the number of locations available for the Navy’s
launch and test capabilities, including through the use of maritime
spaceports as supplementary launch options.
Space access, mobility, and logistics
The committee remains concerned about increasing threats in
space as adversaries continue to develop and deploy advanced capa-
bilities to hold at risk, degrade, and destroy U.S. and allied na-
tional security space assets. In this new threat environment, estab-
lishing and sustaining freedom of maneuver and operations in tra-
ditional orbits and in cislunar space for dynamic space operations
in peacetime, crisis, or conflict requires an effective space logistics

architecture and enterprise. For this reason, the committee con-
tinues to support Servicing, Mobility, and Logistics (SML) pro-
grams to meet U.S. Space Command’s (SPACECOM) need for sus-
tained space maneuver in the near-term.
The 2022 U.S. Space Force Operations Doctrine for Space Forces
notes that SML to enable movement and support of military equip-
ment and personnel into, within, and from space ‘‘is integral to de-
livering freedom of action and independent options to the joint
force.’’ The U.S. Space Force has established increasingly capable
and competitive access into space.
However, to date, the U.S. Space Force currently lacks oper-
ational, space-resident assets capable of maneuvering relevant dis-
tances consistent with the 2022 doctrine. Also lacking is a logistics
enterprise for mobility throughout the space domain and for sus-
taining, redeploying, or reallocating forces in orbit. U.S. Space
Force and SPACECOM thus face logistical constraints for flexible,
cost-effective space access and on-orbit sustainment beyond low
earth orbit. The committee is aware that commercial providers are
currently developing novel SML capabilities. Developing and de-
ploying space-resident transportation and mobility capabilities, in-
cluding refuellable upper stages or refuellable orbital transfer vehi-
cles (OTVs) with high delta-v, would complement traditional
launch services to reduce the cost of satellite deployment to unique
or high-energy orbits, increase the flexibility of space asset deploy-
ment, and create resilient on-orbit response and sustainment capa-
bilities.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in coordination with SPACECOM, to provide a one-time briefing to
the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than December 1, 2025, to assess: (1)
The operations and acquisition plans necessary for on-orbit logis-
tics, including for refuellable, high delta-v OTVs, to deliver space
assets to high-energy orbits and provide capabilities for on-orbit
repositioning; and (2) The advisability and feasibility of assuming
responsibility for the cancelled On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and
Manufacturing-1 spacecraft.
Space cooperation with allies and partners in Indo-Pacific
region
The committee believes that potential cooperation with allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, South Korea,
Australia, and India, is in our national security interest given the
growing space threat posed by China.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Space Policy and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Indo-Pacific Security Affairs to brief the congressional defense com-
mittees, not later than March 31, 2026, on efforts to coordinate
best practices in space with the governments of Japan, South
Korea, Australia, India, and other relevant allies and partners in
the Indo-Pacific region, including best practices on space situa-
tional awareness and space industrial policy and other matters of
mutual interest.

Support for Space Development Agency’s acquisition model
The committee supports the Space Development Agency’s (SDA)
innovative acquisition model, which emphasizes rapid procurement,
scalability, and flexibility in addressing the growing demands for
space-based capabilities critical to national defense. The SDA’s ap-
proach has proven to be effective in reducing bureaucratic delays
and ensuring the rapid delivery of cutting-edge space systems to
the warfighter to keep pace with our adversaries. The committee
particularly applauds the SDA for defining requirements without
the lengthy processes typically associated with the Joint Capabili-
ties Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and for its use
of Other Transactions Agreements (OTA) that expedite traditional
contracting processes. Through its approach to requirements and
by utilizing OTAs, the SDA has demonstrated its ability to accel-
erate procurement timelines, bringing advanced technologies to the
field more efficiently than traditional acquisition methods allow.
To maintain the rapid delivery of space-based capabilities to the
warfighter, the committee supports the implementation of rec-
ommendations made in the February 26, 2025, report of the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) titled ‘‘Laser Communica-
tions: Space Development Agency Should Create Links Between
Development Phases’’ (GAO–25–106838). The committee encour-
ages the SDA to install an industry integrator for future tranches
of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture to ensure that
different vendors’ satellite optical communications terminals are
able to communicate with each other. The integration of these ca-
pabilities is critical for the rapid delivery of robust laser commu-
nications capabilities for missile warning and data transport. The
committee further encourages the SDA to use the full range of
available financial, contractual, and policy tools to maintain devel-
opment timelines and avoid increasing costs through the commer-
cial integration process.
The committee encourages continued investment in the SDA’s ac-
quisition approach, which balances the need for rapid acquisition
with the advantages of maintaining a competitive, multi-provider
landscape while considering the role of support contractors in the
rapid acquisition process. The committee further emphasizes the
importance of continued collaboration between the SDA, other enti-
ties of the Department of Defense, and the commercial space indus-
try to ensure that the United States remains the global leader in
space technology.
Therefore, the committee directs the Director of the SDA to pro-
vide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the following: (1) The SDA’s
progress toward implementing the recommendations made by GAO
in GAO–25–106838; (2) The range of financial, contractual, and
policy tools the SDA uses to ensure efficient acquisition and tech-
nology integration; and (3) The activities the SDA undertakes to
collaborate with the Department of Defense and the commercial
space industry.

Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking pro-
gram
The committee recognizes the intent behind the U.S. Space
Force’s Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Tracking
(TacSRT) program to enhance operational support through com-
mercial data analytics. However, the committee is concerned that
TacSRT may be duplicative of existing intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities elsewhere in the Department
of Defense (DOD), including those executed by combatant com-
mands and agencies such as the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency.
Additionally, the committee is concerned that the program may
blur the lines between tactical ISR and intelligence functions tradi-
tionally subject to more robust oversight mechanisms, raising po-
tential implications for the delineation of roles and responsibilities,
required analytical rigor, and the proper classification and han-
dling of sensitive information.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Chief of Space Operations
to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than January
25, 2026. The briefing shall include: (1) A description of TacSRT’s
current and planned capabilities and how they are distinct from or
coordinated with DoD ISR programs; (2) An explanation of the pro-
gram’s governance structure, including how oversight, data classi-
fication, and interagency coordination are managed; (3) An assess-
ment of the potential for duplication with existing programs and
how such duplication is being mitigated; (4) A review of how the
Space Force ensures that TacSRT does not encroach upon activities
traditionally subject to intelligence oversight; and (5) A summary
of any policy guidance or memoranda of understanding that govern
the use of commercial ISR in TacSRT operations.
Tactically Responsive Space
The committee notes the progress made on demonstrating
Tactically Responsive Space’s (TacRS) capabilities and its role in
securing our Nation’s interests in, from, and to space. The com-
mittee notes that TacRS is designed to challenge traditional as-
sumptions and processes by demonstrating the United States’ capa-
bility to rapidly acquire, launch, and operate a space vehicle on
operationally relevant timelines in order to respond to on-orbit
threats while also leveraging the innovation from commercial con-
tributions and private sector innovation. The committee believes
the Department of Defense should develop a strategic plan, includ-
ing the establishment of a program of record with the appropriate
funding and prioritization, to enable the warfighter to use this ca-
pability.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force,
in consultation with the Chief of Space Operations, to provide a
brief to the congressional defense committees, not later than March
31, 2026, on TacRS. This briefing shall include, at a minimum, the
following items: (1) A plan detailing a 5-year roadmap for the de-
velopment, demonstration, integration, and funding of TacRS to in-
clude launch and space systems; (2) An evaluation of the current
industrial base for TacRS that could be used for TacRS, the Space

Development Agency, and space control missions; and (3) An eval-
uation of associated actions and milestones required to ensure suc-
cessful operational integration of TacRS for both on-orbit and
ground-based space systems.
Unified Data Library (UDL) integration and sensor data fu-
sion
The committee recognizes the critical role of data integration,
real-time sensor fusion, and decision support in enhancing national
defense operations. The committee notes that the Unified Data Li-
brary (UDL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in consolidating,
normalizing, and securely sharing diverse data streams to support
multi-domain awareness, threat detection, space situational aware-
ness, and health records across the Department of Defense. The
committee further notes the cost savings and operational effi-
ciencies realized through the UDL’s current implementation within
the U.S. Space Force and its increasing applicability to broader
joint and interagency missions.
Given the rising demand for data-driven decision-making across
combatant commands, the committee encourages the Department
of Defense to prioritize the integration of radar and sensor systems
within the UDL framework to enhance warfighter decision-making
in operationally relevant timelines. The ability to aggregate and
fuse data from space-based, airborne, and ground-based sensors
into a common operational picture will provide actionable informa-
tion to warfighters, enabling rapid and informed decision-making
across multiple domains. The UDL’s demonstrated ability to mobi-
lize data and rapidly connect disparate systems enables dramatic
cost savings across the enterprise and enables rapid operational
modernization across all domains not previously achieved.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a one-time briefing to the congressional defense committees,
not later than March 31, 2026, on the Department’s strategy for
enterprise-wide UDL adoption. This briefing should include rec-
ommendations for long-term governance, funding requirements, the
integration of radar and sensor data, and the potential for Office
of the Secretary of Defense sponsorship of the UDL to ensure its
availability across all military services and defense agencies as
needed.

TITLE XVI—CYBERSPACE RELATED MATTERS
Subtitle A—Matters Relating to Cyber Operations and Cyber
Forces
Sec. 1601—Comprehensive cyber workforce strategy
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, acting through the Department of Defense
(DOD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for Cyber Policy, to develop a comprehensive cyber
workforce strategy and submit a report to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than January 31, 2027. The provision directs the report
to include eleven specific elements.
The committee recognizes that the United States faces an un-
precedented and rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape that de-
mands a fundamentally transformed approach to cyber workforce
development and management within the DOD. The committee
notes with concern that current cyber talent acquisition and reten-
tion efforts have not kept pace with the sophistication and scale of
adversarial cyber capabilities, creating critical vulnerabilities in
national defense infrastructure and operations. The committee be-
lieves that this comprehensive strategy represents a vital step to-
ward addressing systemic workforce challenges that have hindered
the DOD’s ability to effectively counter state and non-state cyber
actors who continue to target critical defense systems and sensitive
information.
The committee also recognizes the increasing challenges faced by
the DOD in combating malicious cyber actors and the critical need
for collaboration with industry and academia to enhance the devel-
opment and throughput of highly skilled cybersecurity profes-
sionals through the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
program. The committee directs the DOD to evaluate the integra-
tion of programs to upskill the workforce, hosted and funded
through various academic institutions, into the activities and ef-
forts of the Cyber Academic Engagement Office under the DOD
CIO. The committee believes these programs are efficient solutions
to support the growth of small businesses within the defense indus-
trial base.
Sec. 1602—United States Cyber Command artificial intel-
ligence industry collaboration roadmap
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), in coordination
with senior Department of Defense (DOD) artificial intelligence and
research officials, to develop a roadmap for industry and academic
collaboration on artificial intelligence-enabled cyber capabilities for

cyberspace operations. The roadmap must address: (1) Collabo-
rative development lines of effort; (2) Industry engagement strate-
gies; (3) Contractual mechanisms; (4) Security clearance require-
ments; and (5) Organizational structure options, and be completed
by August 1, 2026. The Commander, CYBERCOM, shall provide a
briefing to the congressional defense committees on the roadmap,
courses of action, and selected approach by November 1, 2026, with
annual updates beginning with the fiscal year 2028 budget submis-
sion and continuing until 2030.
The committee recognizes that the rapidly evolving cyber domain
requires CYBERCOM to maintain close integration with entities
developing cutting-edge technologies, ensuring the Cyber Mission
Force possesses the most capable tools to hold adversaries at risk
and impose costs across the domain. The committee acknowledges
that while advanced technologies are being developed in national
laboratories and by Department of Defense research organizations
such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, industry
remains a critical partner in this endeavor. The committee is con-
cerned, however, with the current level of industry engagement
and collaboration on artificial intelligence-enabled cyber tools and
technologies. The committee notes that CYBERCOM possesses the
necessary budget and authorities to establish a robust program of
cooperative research, testing, and deployment of artificial intel-
ligence-enabled cyber tools, yet structured industry partnerships
remain underdeveloped. The committee believes that given the cur-
rent threat environment, there is an urgent need to accelerate
these collaborative relationships through a comprehensive roadmap
that maximizes the integration of commercial innovation with mili-
tary cyber capabilities.
Sec. 1603—Strategy for deterrence against cyberattacks
against defense critical infrastructure of the United
States
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to develop a strategy and courses of action to
create credible deterrence against cyberattacks on U.S. defense
critical infrastructure. The strategy must evaluate how to deter ad-
versary cyber actions and outline methods to impose costs on ad-
versaries targeting critical infrastructure. The provision also estab-
lishes requirements for an interim briefing and a final briefing to
the congressional defense committees on the strategy and courses
of action, not later than March 1, 2026, and June 1, 2026, respec-
tively.
The committee remains concerned that the current strategy to
deter attacks against defense critical infrastructure is not adequate
as evidenced by the activities of the Volt Typhoon and Salt Ty-
phoon persistent cyber actors. The committee believes that appro-
priate options to reestablish this deterrence and available response
options to detected activities is critical.

Sec. 1604—Amendment to annual assessments and reports
on assignment of certain budget control responsibility
to Commander of the United States Cyber Command
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1558 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) to include a require-
ment for a review of investments in artificial intelligence (AI) as
compared to roadmap milestones and identified use cases pre-
viously established by the Department of Defense (DOD), as well
as to extend the reporting requirement until fiscal year 2030.
The committee recognizes the DOD’s continued investment in AI
capabilities as a strategic priority to maintain technological superi-
ority and operational advantage. To ensure these investments are
effectively aligned with the Department’s broader modernization
goals and to ensure sustained oversight and continuity in assessing
the Department’s AI strategy and execution, the committee be-
lieves that additional review will provide greater visibility into and
sustained oversight of the Department’s progress in developing, in-
tegrating, and operationalizing AI capabilities across mission areas.
Sec. 1605—Report on reserve component integration into
cyber mission force and cyberspace operations
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy and the Commander,
U.S. Cyber Command, in collaboration with the Chief of the Na-
tional Guard Bureau and military service component leadership, to
report on reserve component integration into Cyber Mission Forces.
The committee acknowledges the unique capabilities, skills, and
authorities of reserve component personnel, who often possess ad-
vanced technical expertise and industry relationships from their ci-
vilian careers that are directly applicable to the Department of De-
fense’s cyber mission. The report shall examine: (1) How to utilize
Title 32 authorities to support domestic missions and provide
greater flexibility in integrating talent; (2) Strategies for leveraging
local industry expertise; (3) Methods to track civilian skills; (4) Re-
source requirements; and (5) Recommendations for improved re-
serve component utilization in cyberspace operations. The report
shall be submitted to the congressional defense committees by Feb-
ruary 1, 2026, with the officials providing a briefing by March 1,
2026.
The committee is concerned that the Department has not fully
identified, tracked, or integrated these unique capabilities into its
Cyber Mission Force structure and operational planning. The com-
mittee believes that improved understanding of these issues as ar-
ticulated by this comprehensive assessment and implementation
plan will help ensure that the Department is able to fully leverage
the skills and authorities of the reserve component to the max-
imum extent possible.
Sec. 1606—Evaluation of cyber range management and fund-
ing
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to complete a comprehensive evaluation of De-
partment of Defense cyber range oversight, not later than January

15, 2027, examining the separate executive agent designations for
cyber test and training ranges. The evaluation would assess fund-
ing mechanisms, integration possibilities, and impacts on transfer-
ring systems from test to operational use. Further, the committee
directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees on findings of such evaluation and
any implementation plans for changes to cyber range oversight.
The committee is concerned with inconsistent funding across
cyber ranges and the absence of a consolidated test-to-training
strategy in a domain that requires speed. The committee believes
the current construct of two independent executive agents may im-
pede rapid transition of capabilities to operational use. The com-
mittee notes that as the Cyber Mission Force matures, it is impor-
tant to reevaluate periodically organizational structures supporting
its mission. The committee expects this evaluation to identify effi-
ciencies and improvements that better support the Department’s
cyber requirements.
Sec. 1607—Modification to reporting requirements for Sen-
ior Military Advisor for Cyber Policy
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 392a(b) of title 10, United States Code, by modifying the re-
porting requirements for the Senior Military Advisor for Cyber Pol-
icy and Deputy Principal Cyber Advisor. The provision updates var-
ious reporting relationships by replacing references to ‘‘the Under
Secretary of Defense for Policy’’ with ‘‘the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Cyber Policy’’ throughout the relevant statutory lan-
guage. This change streamlines the chain of command and clarifies
that cyber policy matters will now be reported directly to the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy rather than the
broader Under Secretary position.
Sec. 1608—Planning, programming, and budget coordination
for operations of cyber mission force
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 167b of title 10, United States Code, to codify enhanced budget
authority for Cyber Mission Force operations of the Commander,
U.S. Cyber Command that had previously been established in sec-
tion 1507 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2022 (Public Law 117–81).
Sec. 1609—Expansion of scope of affirmation of authority
for cyber operations to include defense of critical infra-
structure of the Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would expand the
scope of affirmation of authority for cyber operations under section
394 of title 10, United States Code, to include defense of critical in-
frastructure of the Department of Defense.
Sec. 1610—Review of future force employment concepts and
associated personnel policy needs for evolving cyber
forces
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a review of future force employ-

ment concepts for cyber forces, including all elements of the Cyber
Operations Force, to assess where additional personnel policy
changes may be warranted.
Sec. 1610A—Evaluation of Joint Task Force-Cyber in sup-
port of geographic combatant commands
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive study on estab-
lishing Joint Task Force-Cyber elements across all geographic com-
batant commands and evaluate force employment in support of
combatant commands by July 1, 2026.
Sec. 1610B—Prohibition on availability of funds to modify
authorities of the Commander of United States Cyber
Command
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
use of funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise
made available for fiscal year 2026 for the Department of Defense
to modify, reorganize, or otherwise change the responsibilities, au-
thorities, or command structure of the Commander, U.S. Cyber

Sec. 1610C—Program for talent management of cyber per-
sonnel through active and reserve transitioning
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to design and implement a program, not later
than May 1, 2026, as part of the Defense Cyber Workforce Frame-
work to support active management of cyber talent transitioning to
the reserve cyber force.
Sec. 1610D—Designation of Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Cyber Policy as principal staff assistant
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 138(b)(8) of title 10, United States Code, to designate the As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy as a principal staff as-
sistant that reports directly to the Secretary of Defense.
Subtitle B—Matters Relating to Department of Defense
Cybersecurity and Information Technology
Sec. 1611—Modernization program for full content inspec-
tion
The committee recommends a provision that would modify sec-
tion 1515 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) by formally renaming the modernization
program from ‘‘Network Boundary and Cross-Domain Defense’’ to
‘‘Full Content Inspection’’ (FCI). The provision would add a new im-
plementation phase requiring the integration of artificial intel-
ligence (AI) capabilities into the pilot program by December 1,
2026, in order to illuminate and actively counter foreign cyber ag-
gression against Department of Defense (DOD) networks. The pro-
vision also requires briefings on this program to the congressional
defense committees, with the first briefing not later than November

1, 2026, and additional briefings to follow every year thereafter
until 2028.
The committee acknowledges the increasing sophistication and
capabilities of cyber threats targeting the Department’s networks.
The committee notes that the Department must leverage advanced
technologies, particularly AI, to enhance its cybersecurity posture.
The committee believes these modifications are necessary to broad-
en the scope of the modernization program and ensure the Depart-
ment employs all available technologies to secure defense networks
at the packet layer. The committee further notes that robust FCI
capabilities will provide essential visibility and control over net-
work traffic and data flows, which are critical elements for detect-
ing and mitigating sophisticated cyber attacks that may otherwise
evade conventional security measures.
Sec. 1612—Assessment regarding real-time monitoring of de-
fense weapons platforms for cyber threats
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretaries of each
military department and the Under Secretary of Defense for Intel-
ligence and Security, to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the
feasibility and advisability of establishing a program for imple-
menting real-time monitoring for self-protection capabilities across
Department of Defense weapon system platforms and provide a re-
port to the congressional defense committees detailing findings,
recommendations, and implementation strategies not later than
January 1, 2027.
The committee remains concerned with the increasing threats to
weapon systems, particularly those built before the institution of
cyber security requirements as part of the acquisition process, and
the lack of progress with remediation efforts after many years of
analysis. The committee believes that these platforms should be se-
cured more expeditiously than the 2035 timeline identified in re-
cent comments made by the Department of Defense Zero Trust Of-
fice. Accelerating this timeline is critical to address current and
emerging cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could compromise oper-
ational effectiveness and security of such weapons systems.
Sec. 1613—Assessment of feasibility and advisability of es-
tablishing an operational technology cybersecurity
training center of excellence
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, acting through the Chief Information Officer
of the Department of Defense, to determine the feasibility and ad-
visability of establishing a center of excellence for operational tech-
nology cybersecurity training by December 1, 2026. The provision
would require assessing whether such a center would effectively in-
stitutionalize training on security and the protection of operational
technology and industrial control systems associated with defense
critical infrastructure. The provision would require the Secretary to
submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later
than December 1, 2026, on the findings and recommendations of
this assessment.

Sec. 1614—Framework for integration of information tech-
nology technical debt assessment into annual budget
process
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a framework for in-
tegrating technical debt assessment into existing Department of
Defense (DOD) processes, not later than September 1, 2026, to sup-
port the fiscal year 2027 planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution processes. The provision would require the Secretary to
reevaluate the Department’s technical debt definition and ensure
budget justification materials include technical debt assessments,
planned investments, and risk evaluations. The provision would re-
quire a briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later
than September 15, 2026, on the framework’s implementation and
effectiveness.
The committee supports initiatives to remediate extensive tech-
nical debt across the DOD but remains concerned about inadequate
frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and remediating risks asso-
ciated with deferred investments. The committee believes existing
organizational structures should be leveraged to facilitate more ef-
fective implementation of technical debt management. The com-
mittee recognizes the Cyber Investment Management Board as an
ideal mechanism for coordinating these activities throughout the
Department. The committee expects this approach will strengthen
governance while minimizing administrative burden and promoting
consistent application of technical debt standards.
Sec. 1615—Mission Infrastructure Resilience Task Force
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a Mission Infrastructure Resil-
ience Task Force, within 180 days of the date of the enactment of
this Act, to assess vulnerabilities in defense critical infrastructure
necessary for executing defense operational and contingency plans.
The Task Force would conduct infrastructure vulnerability assess-
ments, develop remediation solutions, and establish readiness as-
sessment frameworks for installation and combatant commanders.
The Task Force must also develop a transition plan for converting
into a permanent Department of Defense organization, not later
than 180 days prior to its September 30, 2030 termination date.
The provision would require the Secretary of Defense to provide an-
nual briefings to the congressional defense committees, beginning
180 days before termination through September 30, 2033.
Sec. 1616—Plan for deploying private fifth generation Open
Radio Access Networks on Department of Defense bases
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretaries of the military departments to develop prioritized lists
of bases that merit investment in private fifth-generation (5G)
Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN), pursuant to section 1526 of
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Pub-
lic Law 118–31) and the Department of Defense (DOD) Private 5G
Deployment Strategy, dated October 2024. The provision would di-
rect the Secretary of Defense to consolidate these prioritized base
lists and determine an optimal investment, deployment, and spend

plan for private 5G ORAN networks across the DOD. The provision
would require coordination among the Secretaries of the military
departments and the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and
Engineering, the Chief Information Officer of the DOD, and rel-
evant combatant commanders and directors of defense agencies.
The Secretary of Defense would be required to provide a report on
this matter to the congressional defense committees, not later than
March 1, 2026.
Sec. 1617—Limitation on funds for travel pending briefing
on process for best-in-class cyber data products and
services
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated for
travel for the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of the Chief In-
formation Officer (CIO) until the DOD CIO, in coordination with
military service CIOs and Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA) Director, provides a briefing to the congressional defense
committees on establishing a competitive process for procuring
best-in-class cybersecurity solutions. The briefing must detail: (1)
The implementation status of Section 1521 requirements from the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public
Law 117–81); (2) An outline of an acquisition strategy for enter-
prise-wide procurement; and (3) Funding estimates for fiscal years
2026–2030.
The committee is concerned with the Department’s failure to for-
mally establish and identify an executive agent and program office,
as required by law. The committee recognizes that while certain of-
fices may perform similar functions, the Department has not offi-
cially designated any entity as the executive agent nor dem-
onstrated how existing structures fulfill the statutory require-
ments. The committee believes this lack of formal designation sig-
nificantly undermines the Department’s ability to implement a co-
hesive, enterprise-wide approach to cybersecurity acquisitions.
Sec. 1618—Limitation of funds for travel expenses for the
Office of the Chief Information Officer
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the obli-
gation or expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated for
travel for the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of the Chief In-
formation Officer (CIO) until the DOD CIO, in coordination with
the military departments’ CIOs, submits to the congressional de-
fense committees a comprehensive circuit transport transition plan
for updating legacy circuits to more modern Internet Protocol (IP)-
based circuits. The plan must identify: (1) All legacy circuits still
being used by the Department; (2) Establish transition timelines to
move to IP-based circuits; (3) Detail resource requirements; (4)
Specify budget funding lines where such requirements are cap-
tured; and (5) Include Future Years Defense Program investments.
The committee acknowledges that legacy telecommunications cir-
cuits represent one of the most significant examples of technical
debt within the Department. The committee believes that the De-
partment has been woefully behind in modernizing DOD tele-
communications infrastructure to enhance security and operational

capabilities across defense networks. While the committee acknowl-
edges the Department has undertaken some efforts to address this
issue, the committee remains concerned that insufficient progress
has been made to eliminate these obsolete systems, which pose
substantial risks to both cybersecurity posture and operational
readiness. The committee believes that accelerating the transition
to modern IP-based circuits is essential to maintaining techno-
logical advantage and network resilience in contested environ-
ments.
Sec. 1619—Limitation on availability of funds for the Com-
bined Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative
The committee recommends a provision that would limit the
funds authorized to be appropriated for research, development,
test, and evaluation, Defense-wide, for the Joint Staff and the Chief
Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer for the Combined Joint
All-Domain Command and Control initiative until the Secretary of
Defense provides to the congressional defense committees a frame-
work for such initiative that helps guide investments and measures
progress for the initiative.
Sec. 1620—Review of Joint Fires Network program transi-
tion
The committee recommends a provision that would require re-
view of the transition of the Joint Fires Network initiative to a pro-
gram of record within the Department of the Air Force.
Sec. 1620A—Prohibition of the elimination of certain cyber
assessment capabilities for test and evaluation
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
Secretary of Defense from divesting, consolidating, or curtailing
current cyber assessment capabilities or National Security Agency-
certified red teams supporting operational test and evaluation for
Department of Defense programs until providing a comprehensive
certification to the congressional defense committees. The certifi-
cation must include an analytic basis for the decision, independent
review by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evalua-
tion, certification by the Director of the Test Resource Management
Center per section 4173(c)(1)(B) of title 10, United States Code, and
a comprehensive transition plan with funding requirements and
continuity measures.
Sec. 1620B—Modification to certification requirement re-
garding contracting for military recruiting
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 1555 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2024 (Public Law 118–31) to permanently require the Secretary of
Defense to obtain a certification from any entity that contracts with
the Department of Defense for the purpose of placing military re-
cruitment advertisement, that the entity does not rate news infor-
mation sources for factual accuracy or provide ratings or opinions
on news sources regarding misinformation.

Secretary of Defense to convene a working group, not later than
March 1, 2026, to develop a strategy and report on ensuring the
security, resiliency, and integrity of undersea cables.
Subtitle C—Data and Artificial Intelligence
Sec. 1621—Public-private cybersecurity partnership for
highly capable artificial intelligence systems
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy to establish a pub-
lic-private partnership body not later than 180 days after the en-
actment of this Act to address cybersecurity and physical security
threats to highly capable artificial intelligence and machine learn-
ing systems. The partnership would facilitate engagement between
the Department of Defense and commercial industry partners to
align security frameworks against sophisticated state actors. The
provision requires annual reports to congressional defense commit-
tees beginning one year after establishment and continuing until
December 1, 2030.
Sec. 1622—Digital sandbox environments for artificial intel-
ligence
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense, acting through the Chief Digital and Artifi-
cial Intelligence Officer and the Department of Defense (DOD)
Chief Information Officer, to establish a task force on artificial in-
telligence sandbox environments, not later than April 1, 2026. The
task force would develop virtual environments supporting artificial
intelligence experimentation across the DOD for users of all tech-
nical proficiency levels. The provision requires an initial briefing to
the congressional defense committees, not later than August 1,
2026, with annual briefings thereafter until the task force termi-
nates on January 1, 2030.
The committee notes with interest the progress made by the De-
partment of the Army in establishing robust artificial intelligence
sandbox capabilities that support both large language models and
essential data science functionalities. The committee recognizes
similar initiatives underway within the Department of the Air
Force and encourages continued development of these critical capa-
bilities. The committee strongly believes these environments are es-
sential for both workforce development and technical innovation in
artificial intelligence applications. The committee emphasizes that
investments into the development and enhancement of these envi-
ronments, ideally across multiple security fabrics, must be
prioritized going forward.

cial intelligence (AI) model assessment and oversight by June 1,
2026. This team, led by the Department of Defense (DOD) Chief
Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer (CDAO), would develop a
standardized assessment framework for DOD AI models not later
than June 1, 2027, with identification of functional area leads not
later than January 1, 2027. Further, initial assessments of major
AI systems would be required no later than January 1, 2028, with
the cross-functional team sunsetting five years after enactment.
The Secretary would be required to brief the congressional defense
committees within 30 days after completion of each implementation
milestone and submit a transition plan to the committees 180 days
before termination.
The committee believes that establishing coherent governance
structures for model assessment, tracking, and oversight is critical
for successful AI implementation across the Department. The com-
mittee emphasizes this governance is especially important in mili-
tary contexts where operational conditions evolve rapidly and mod-
els must adapt accordingly. As battlefield environments change, AI
models require continuous evaluation to maintain effectiveness.
The committee understands a well-structured governance frame-
work would enhance return on investment by enabling the develop-
ment of branch models for correlated use cases while preserving
model lineage information that is essential for proper evaluation.
The committee further notes this framework would establish
groundwork for model assessment reciprocity, allowing more rapid
deployment of models across different components and use cases.
This approach would maximize the Department’s investments in
both custom-developed and commercial AI models.
The committee observes that several federal initiatives have suc-
cessfully implemented such governance frameworks and strongly
encourages the Department to build upon these established best
practices when developing its program to maximize economies of
scale and avoid duplicative development efforts.
The committee emphasizes that this provision is not intended to
create additional bureaucratic hurdles or security requirements
that would impede model development and deployment. The com-
mittee instead intends to facilitate greater transparency into model
capabilities and characteristics, thereby enhancing collaboration
across the Department and accelerating the development of special-
ized branch models. The committee believes this balanced approach
will strengthen the Department’s capacity to harness artificial in-
telligence while maintaining appropriate oversight of these increas-
ingly critical technologies.
Sec. 1624—Department of Defense Ontology Governance
Working Group
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a Department of Defense (DOD)
Ontology Governance Working Group to develop and implement a
common data ontology and governance structure to improve data
interoperability and enable more effective decision-making. The
Working Group would establish domain-specific data ontologies,
designate functional domain leads, and implement a governance
framework. Key deadlines include establishing the Working Group

not later than June 1, 2026, developing Department-level policy not
later than June 1, 2027, and completing implementation not later
than January 1, 2028, with an interim briefing to congressional de-
fense committees from the Working Group due not later than July
1, 2027, and a report to the same committees from the Secretary
due not later than June 30, 2028.
The committee strongly commends the Department’s collabo-
rative efforts with the Chief Data Officer in the Office of the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence through the DOD and Intelligence Com-
munity Ontology Working Group in establishing the Basic Formal
Ontology and Common Core Ontology as foundational elements for
cross-domain information exchange. The committee notes that
these policy actions represent a significant milestone in developing
robust mechanisms for data integration, retrieval, and analysis
across disparate systems. The committee believes it is important to
ensure that there is a clear framework and forum for continuing
this work into building domain-specific ontology at the pace that is
needed. The committee expects that this structured governance ap-
proach will drive substantial advances in ontological interoper-
ability throughout the DOD enterprise and among mission part-
ners, critically enhancing decision superiority and operational effec-
tiveness in an increasingly complex and contested information envi-
ronment.
Sec. 1625—Modification of high-performance computing
roadmap
The committee recommends a provision that would modify the
high-performance computing roadmap requirements in section
1532(c) of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law
118–159). The provision would direct the Secretary of Defense to
expand the roadmap to include both Department of Defense-owned
computing assets and commercially procured cloud services or in-
frastructure-as-a-service contracts. For any data centers to be built
or expanded on military installations, the provision would require
comprehensive assessments including physical space needs, elec-
tricity and water usage requirements for artificial intelligence data
center footprints, anticipated impacts on installations and sur-
rounding communities, and strategies to prevent utility service dis-
ruptions while ensuring community resilience. The Secretary must
provide triennial updates to the roadmap, with the first update due
not later than March 1, 2027, and subsequent updates due every
third year thereafter until March 1, 2033, to be submitted to the
congressional defense committees.
Sec. 1626—Artificial General Intelligence Steering Com-
mittee
The committee recommends a provision that would establish an
Artificial General Intelligence Steering Committee within the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) to analyze artificial intelligence trajec-
tories and develop DOD adoption strategies. The provision would
require the Secretary of Defense to establish the committee by
April 1, 2026, with the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serving as co-chairpersons.

Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, not later than January 31, 2027.
Sec. 1627—Physical and cybersecurity procurement require-
ments for artificial intelligence systems
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity and
physical security framework for artificial intelligence (AI) and ma-
chine learning technologies procured by the Department of Defense.
The framework must address workforce risks, supply chain
vulnerabilities, adversarial tampering, data exposure risks, and se-
curity management practices, with security levels scaled to na-
tional security risks and designed to counter peer and near-peer
nation threats. The provision would authorize the Secretary to
amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to
require contractors developing, deploying, storing, or hosting cov-
ered AI technologies to implement the framework’s best practices,
with requirements tailored to specific technologies while consid-
ering cost-benefit analysis. The provision would also require the
Secretary to submit an implementation status report to the con-
gressional defense committees not later than 180 days after the
date of the enactment of this Act, building upon existing frame-
works such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology
Special Publication 800 series and the Cybersecurity Maturity
Model Certification framework.
Sec. 1628—Guidance and prohibition on use of certain artifi-
cial intelligence

Items of Special Interest
Advancing Analytics data platform application integration
framework
The committee recognizes the Department of Defense’s (DOD)
substantial investment in the Advancing Analytics (ADVANA) data
platform and commends the progress achieved in establishing a
foundational enterprise data management and visualization pro-
gram. The committee believes that the long-term scalability, sus-
tainability, and mission utility of the ADVANA platform is contin-
gent upon establishing a structured, transparent onboarding frame-
work that aligns with broader DOD digital modernization objec-
tives. However, the committee is concerned that the DOD lacks a
comprehensive strategy for application onboarding that includes
clear evaluation criteria, prioritization methodology, and appro-
priate metrics for determining integration sequencing. Further-
more, the committee notes the absence of standardized cost recov-
ery models to facilitate financial planning between the platform ad-
ministrators and component organizations seeking application inte-
gration.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Chief Digital and Artifi-
cial Intelligence Officer (CDAO) to develop and implement a com-
prehensive application integration strategy for the ADVANA data
platform. This strategy should: (1) Establish objective criteria for
evaluating and prioritizing applications based on operational mis-
sion impact, data sensitivity classification requirements, technical
compatibility with existing ADVANA architecture, and overall
value to the DOD data ecosystem; (2) Define standardized reim-
bursable funding mechanisms, including potential service-level
agreements or other appropriate cost-sharing models, between the
CDAO and requesting DOD components; (3) Include performance
metrics to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the
onboarding process; and (4) Align with existing DOD data govern-
ance policies and enterprise digital transformation initiatives.
The CDAO should complete development and commence imple-
mentation of this framework not later than January 31, 2026. The
committee further directs the CDAO to provide a comprehensive
briefing to the congressional defense committees on the frame-
work’s structure, implementation status, and initial outcomes, not
later than March 31, 2026.
Artificial intelligence for assistive automation
The committee is aware that the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities
Development Command (DEVCOM) Analysis Center has an effort
to develop an analytical framework for leveraging and incor-
porating artificial intelligence (AI) and assistive automation (AA)
into Army operations. This effort supports human-machine teaming
integration by assessing the performance of individuals and teams
assisted with artificial intelligence or autonomous systems through
the development and definition of metrics which will permit quan-
titative and comparative assessment of these new tactical tech-

nologies. The committee believes this will enable the DEVCOM
Analysis Center to conduct analysis on trade-offs of performance,
effectiveness, and vulnerability, as well as analysis on sustain-
ability to enable senior Army decision makers to better evaluate
the impact of integrating developmental AI/AA systems into the
Army structure.
Accordingly, the committee strongly supports extension of the AI/
AA analytical framework and associated metrics to obtain a fuller
understanding of the broad scope of AI/AA applications for mission
command in the Army’s current and future operating environment.
Artificial intelligence-enabled weapons systems center of ex-
cellence
The committee notes that the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159) included section 1534, which required
the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility and advisability
of establishing one or more centers of excellence to support the de-
velopment and maturation of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
weapon systems. The committee believes a federated approach to
such centers will accommodate the differing needs for AI in dif-
ferent domains. The committee notes that the response to that re-
quirement is still in progress but believes that, in responding to
that provision, the Department of Defense should consider how
best to leverage proximity to relevant platforms, as well as where
technical expertise and infrastructure already exist, and how such
efforts might be more closely tied to prototyping, experimentation,
and operational and sustainment activities, in order to best provide
exposure to use cases that might most benefit the Department and
the military services. The committee also urges the Department to
use this as an opportunity to identify and codify relevant AI termi-
nology to provide some consistency, as well as to support future
doctrinal development.
Assessment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities of connected ve-
hicles
The committee recognizes that vehicle digitization and net-
working present both critical opportunities and significant risks for
the Department of Defense (DOD). The committee acknowledges
that connected vehicle technologies offer enhanced sensing capabili-
ties, edge computing, and predictive maintenance that will benefit
military operations. Yet, the committee is concerned that they also
increase the potential attack surface if the DOD is not proactively
prepared to mitigate such risks, as data from these connected vehi-
cles can be used to elicit sensitive patterns of life as well as to pro-
vide outright vectors for cyber attacks against DOD systems and
personnel.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in co-
ordination with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy,
the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the DOD, and the CIOs of
the military departments, to provide a briefing on the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities of connected vehicles and the threats such
vulnerabilities might pose to the DOD to the Committees on Armed
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later

than August 1, 2026. Such briefing must include: (1) Classes of
vulnerabilities presented by connected vehicles, as such connections
might support adversary ubiquitous technical surveillance; (2) A
framework for the Department to assess the risk of such
vulnerabilities, as well as proposed mitigations; (3) An assessment
of the intelligence related to adversary use or exploitation of con-
nected vehicle vulnerabilities; and (4) Identification of centers of
expertise within the DOD with capabilities to identify, assess, miti-
gate, or remediate the kinds of vulnerabilities identified by the De-
partment.
Building core synthetic data sets for model development
The committee is aware that the increasing demands for artifi-
cial intelligence (AI) systems are also increasing demands for data
to train and refine such systems. The consumption of vast amounts
of publicly available data with little or no consideration for the ac-
curacy, bias, or cleanliness of such data for initial training has, in
some cases, resulted in unintended side effects. The committee is
also aware that a response to these shortcomings has been to bal-
ance that initial training with operational or domain specific data
sets that might help refine or focus the AI on specific use cases for
the Department of Defense (DOD). However, that approach also
presents challenges, like limiting competition or comparison be-
tween AI systems and challenging the classification of models
based on their training data.
Accordingly, the committee encourages the DOD, through test or-
ganizations such as the Test Resource Management Center, to gen-
erate more and better synthetic data sets for AI training that can
be shared more broadly with industry, academia, and foreign part-
ners and allies. The committee believes that a focused effort on
synthetic data sets for AI model training would allow the Depart-
ment to make more equitable comparisons of system performance
in support of acquisition competition as well as open up the playing
field to a wider range of industry and academic providers.
Collaborative computing environment in support of AUKUS
partnership
The committee continues to support the Australia, United King-
dom, and United States (AUKUS) agreement and understands the
urgency behind accelerating collaborative progress toward its goals.
To enable this progress, the committee believes that a collaborative
computing environment is necessary to enable Department of De-
fense (DOD) users and their counterparts in the United Kingdom
and Australia to rapidly share information from their own systems
to a common information domain for allied collaboration. This envi-
ronment should have access to productivity tools, digital engineer-
ing, artificial intelligence, and analytics services so that allies can
jointly develop platforms and advanced capabilities at speed and
scale.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense, through the
DOD Chief Information Officer, to conduct a comprehensive study
on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a multi-classifica-
tion level collaborative computing environment to support the
AUKUS partnership initiatives. The study should include a thor-

ough evaluation of various infrastructure options, including cloud-
based, hybrid, and physical infrastructure solutions that would en-
able secure information sharing and joint development capabilities
across different classification levels. The study should address how
such an environment could provide agility by enabling the Depart-
ment to establish additional secure enclaves rapidly, allowing
AUKUS to enable specific communities of interest or incorporate
additional communities quickly, if required. The Secretary should
provide a report on this study to the congressional defense commit-
tees, not later than January 1, 2026.
Competition related to the adoption of artificial intelligence
and commercial cloud computing capabilities
The committee is aware that the market for artificial intelligence
(AI) and commercial cloud computing capabilities for the Depart-
ment of Defense (DOD) is growing but remains focused on growing
the number of performers rather than clustering around a much
smaller set. The committee is concerned that while there are many
small, non-traditional performers in this space, the opportunities to
break through an increasingly consolidated number of AI models
and applications, as well as commercial cloud providers, appear to
be fewer and further between. While the DOD is increasingly fo-
cused on the many technology requirements for the warfighter, the
committee believes that insufficient attention is being paid to
longer-term market dynamics and preventing repeating past mis-
takes that have led to challenges resulting from market consolida-
tion in areas like aviation components, major weapons systems,
and microelectronics.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment, to provide a report to the congres-
sional defense committees, not later than February 15, 2026, as-
sessing the current and long-term AI and commercial cloud com-
puting market. This report shall examine: (1) Competition dynam-
ics between AI and commercial cloud providers, including large and
small companies; (2) Impacts of these competition dynamics on
overall innovation in AI; (3) Barriers to entry for small and new
performers; and (4) The potential or perceived impact of concentra-
tions of market power or market share in the AI space on competi-
tion. The report shall also include recommendations for any legisla-
tive or administrative actions that might improve the DOD’s ability
to make better decisions and increase competition with respect to
AI and commercial cloud resource procurements.
Department of Defense software authorization and accredi-
tation reform
The committee notes that modern software development meth-
odologies are essential to maintaining technological superiority in
an era of strategic competition. Thus, the committee is strongly
supportive of the intent of the Department of Defense (DOD) to im-
prove upon the historically slow and burdensome Authorization to
Operate (ATO) and Risk Management Framework (RMF) proc-
esses. The committee is aware that the Department is considering
implementation of a new process known as Software Fast Track

(SWFT). The committee remains concerned, however, with the lack
of details surrounding the process for SWFT, how it will resolve
these issues, or how it interrelates with implementation of section
1522 of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law
118–159), which also streamlines the ATO process.
In addition to ensuring the efforts within SWFT appropriately
balance the need for cybersecurity with removing duplicative and
unnecessary compliance tasks, the committee contends that several
related elements must be incorporated as part of any reform ef-
forts. For example, the committee also notes that congressional di-
rection regarding reciprocal ATO policies has not been fully imple-
mented across the Department. The committee observes that con-
tinuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) processes have dem-
onstrated significant time and cost savings where implemented.
The committee also believes that there is a critical need to address
operational technology (OT) integration and the intersection of in-
formation technology (IT) and OT within authorization frameworks,
as defense systems increasingly converge these domains.
Accordingly, the committee directs the DOD Chief Information
Officer to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than
March 1, 2026, on the details of the SWFT initiative and its status,
as well as the plans to integrate compliance with reciprocal ATO
policies, the expansion of cATO adoption, and the integration of
operational technology considerations into the initiative’s lines of
effort. The committee further directs that this briefing should in-
clude, at minimum: (1) Details of the SWFT plan, milestones, and
lines of effort; (2) Metrics on current compliance with reciprocal
ATO policies across the military departments and defense agencies;
(3) Identified barriers to implementation of streamlined software
accreditation processes; (4) Measurable goals for reducing ATO
timelines; (5) Resource requirements to fully implement these ini-
tiatives in fiscal year 2027 and across the Future Years Defense
Plan; and (6) A comprehensive assessment of how OT and the
intersection of IT and OT will be integrated into authorization eval-
uation frameworks, including protocols for evaluating software ap-
plications within converged IT and OT environments.
Evaluation of Department of Defense data residency and re-
tention policies
The committee recognizes that as the Department of Defense
(DOD) expands its investments in cloud computing and data stor-
age capabilities to support operational requirements, a comprehen-
sive evaluation of existing data policies is essential. For example,
the committee understands that while no singular policy mandates
that all DOD data be stored exclusively within the continental
United States, current frameworks generally prioritize domestic
data storage for sensitive operational and intelligence information.
Additionally, the committee understands that current policies re-
lated to the time in which data can be retained for various pur-
poses may actually inhibit the ability to collect and store such oper-
ational data for the purposes of training artificial intelligence (AI)
models. The committee believes a thorough assessment of policies

related to data residency and retention are necessary to make sure
that outdated or unnecessary policies originally intended to serve
other purposes do not stand in the way of effective and efficient op-
eration of the Department’s information technology and AI system
or inhibit the Department’s ability to leverage commercial cloud in-
novations and affect interoperability with security partners during
combined activities.
Therefore, the committee directs the DOD Chief Information Of-
ficer, through the Defense Information Systems Agency, and in col-
laboration with the DOD Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence
Officer, to provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, not later than Feb-
ruary 28, 2026, evaluating current data residency and retention re-
quirements and their implications for DOD operations. Such brief-
ing should include: (1) An assessment of the benefits and potential
risks associated with implementing a commercial cloud approach
that is agnostic to data residency for different categories of infor-
mation; (2) An evaluation of double encryption principles and their
effectiveness in protecting data regardless of physical storage loca-
tion; (3) An analysis of sovereign key management frameworks that
incorporate multiple external physical key managers to govern
decryption processes; (4) An examination of how current data resi-
dency requirements affect operational capabilities and information
sharing with security partners; (5) The impact of current data re-
tention policies, either based on policy or statute, on the ability of
the Department to collect and store data to provide for longitudinal
analysis using AI or other machine learning systems; and (6) Rec-
ommendations for policy frameworks that appropriately balance se-
curity imperatives with operational requirements across different
data classification levels.
Evaluation of incentives for acquisition personnel sup-
porting United States Cyber Command
The committee is aware that based on the significant expansion
of authorities granted to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), spe-
cifically the establishment of the Joint Program Executive Office
for the Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture by fiscal year 2027 as
directed in section 1509 of the James M. Inhofe National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263), there
has been an increasing demand for acquisition and contracting pro-
fessionals to support CYBERCOM. While the Cyber Excepted Serv-
ice (CES), established under section 1599f of title 10, United States
Code, was designed to provide the Department of Defense (DOD)
with enhanced flexibility in recruiting and retaining cyber per-
sonnel, the committee remains concerned that competition for simi-
lar personnel from other Federal agencies, with more competitive
compensation packages and career advancement opportunities, is
putting acute pressure on CYBERCOM to attract and retain such
personnel.
Therefore, the committee directs the Commander, CYBERCOM,
in coordination with the DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO) and
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy, to conduct a
comprehensive review of existing incentive pay programs and accel-
erated promotion pathways available to acquisition and program

management personnel within the CES. This review should evalu-
ate opportunities to enhance competitive hiring and retention
through improved incentive structures comparable to those offered
by other Federal agencies.
The committee directs the Commander, CYBERCOM; the DOD
CIO; and the Assistant Secretary to jointly brief the congressional
defense committees on the findings, recommendations, and imple-
mentation plan resulting from this review, not later than May 31,
2026.
Expansion of Department of Defense Cyber Service Acad-
emy Eligibility
The committee affirms its support of the scholarship-for-service
program provided through the Department of Defense Cyber Serv-
ice Academy. The committee further appreciates the Department’s
compliance with the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263) and the effort
to rapidly award scholarships before the fall semester of 2024.
Under the law, program scholarships are permitted for periods of
up to 5 years. Yet, current Department policy limits program eligi-
bility to students who previously completed the first year of an as-
sociate degree or at least 2 years of a bachelor’s degree program.
The committee is concerned that these limitations on eligibility will
hinder the Department’s efforts to develop and retain the highly
skilled cyber workforce that is necessary to defend the nation
against rapidly evolving threats in cyberspace.
Therefore, the committee strongly encourages the Secretary of
Defense to expand the Cyber Service Academy program to the full
extent permitted by law, extending eligibility to all qualified stu-
dents, including first-year students in associate and bachelor’s de-
gree programs.
Implementing open architecture accreditation of encryption
in mounted form factor program
The committee commends the Department of Defense (DOD) for
progress on implementation of Modular Open Systems Architecture
(MOSA) and, in particular, the Army for progress on the Com-
mand, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Modular Open Suite of
Standards Mounted Form Factor (CMFF) program of record. The
committee looks forward to the Army’s commitment to a long-term
resourced program to realize CMFF benefits including reduced size,
weight, and power of systems, increased capability integration on
armored and tactical vehicles, and speed of development and tech-
nology refresh.
While the committee is encouraged by this progress and the an-
ticipated award of CMFF Block 1, the committee is concerned that
the long-term CMFF program may experience significant delay
without establishment of program security accreditation milestones
and firm delivery and fielding dates. The committee understands
that CMFF needs a clear security accreditation strategy for all
CMFF delivery blocks to maintain its program schedule. A prohibi-
tively complicated and unpredictable accreditation process could

negatively impact levels of industry engagement and investments
and lead to lack of program achievement and accountability.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Army, to provide a report to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than February 1, 2026, out-
lining the strategy for implementing a MOSA-specific accreditation
process for implementing DOD Type 1 encryption security. This re-
port shall include anticipated timelines for the accreditation proc-
ess of CMFF systems as well as details on whether Type 1
encryption will be accredited at the system, subsystem, or compo-
nent level. The report shall also include how such processes would
apply to and impact the Army’s CMFF program delivery schedule
and associated funding portfolio for all CMFF blocks.
Improving cyber coordination with foreign partners
The committee is aware that the Comptroller General of the
United States issued a report titled ‘‘Cyberspace Operations: De-
partment of Defense Should Take Steps to Improve Coordination
with Foreign Partners’’ on July 25, 2024 (GAO–24–103716C). The
report outlined several issues related to the ability of the Depart-
ment of Defense to carry out certain cyber coordination activities
with foreign partners and made several recommendations. How-
ever, the committee is not aware that the Department has yet
taken any action to begin implementing these recommendations.
Due to the high interest in collaborating with our foreign partners
and allies in cyberspace, the committee believes it is important for
the Department to have a comprehensive and holistic foreign en-
gagement strategy that addresses known coordination concerns and
improves overall coordination and prioritization of cyber teams and
resources with the geographic combatant commands to ensure such
activities are best aligned with broader theater security cooperation
plans.
Therefore, the committee directs the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Cyber Policy, in coordination with the Commander, U.S.
Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) and the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to develop a comprehensive foreign partner cyber
engagement strategy and to provide a briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than November 1, 2026. Such a foreign partner cyber en-
gagement strategy shall include the following: (1) A framework to
prioritize country engagements with foreign partners, including a
process for factoring the input of the geographic combatant com-
mands based on their respective theater security cooperation plans;
(2) A process for factoring in requests from foreign partners; (3) A
repeatable methodology for assessing the resources needed to exe-
cute such engagements, in order to promote long-term planning for
sustained engagements; (4) Assessment of burden sharing for costs
between CYBERCOM, the affected geographic combatant com-
mand, and the affected partner nation; (5) A system or dashboard
for tracking and analysis of such foreign partner engagements; (6)
An implementation plan for how the Department intends to resolve
the recommendations made in said GAO report (GAO–24–
103716C); and (7) Other such items that the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Cyber Policy determines to be necessary.

Independent review of lessons learned from United States
Cyber Command acquisition activities
The committee notes that United States Cyber Command
(CYBERCOM) was established with the need to have some distinc-
tive authorities from most other combatant commands.
CYBERCOM is a functional command that at times is a supporting
command and at others is a supported command. The Congress de-
termined CYBERCOM would also need to have acquisition authori-
ties to allow it to develop cyber-peculiar technologies. The com-
mittee acknowledges that developing the core competency, work-
force, processes, and experience to effectively manage an acquisi-
tion enterprise takes time. The committee believes CYBERCOM is
making progress in this direction but also recognizes the oppor-
tunity to evaluate CYBERCOM’s progress in this respect to deter-
mine areas to aid its growth.
Therefore, the committee directs the Inspector General of the De-
partment of Defense to conduct an independent review of the acqui-
sition activities of CYBERCOM and provide a briefing to the con-
gressional defense committees, not later than September 30, 2026.
Such a review should include an assessment of the: (1) Sufficiency
of the acquisition and contracting workforce to determine if
CYBERCOM has a sufficient mix of numbers and skill sets based
on the scale of acquisition activities it is executing, including con-
tracted support; (2) Metrics being used to determine the timeliness
and effectiveness of in-house and assisted acquisition activities; (3)
Processes related to acquisition decision-making to determine if
timelines can be reduced or made more efficient; (4) Timeliness and
effectiveness of entities providing assisted acquisition support to
CYBERCOM; (5) Market research capabilities of CYBERCOM, in-
cluding a representative sample of market research artifacts to as-
sess the sufficiency of such market research; and (6) Lessons
learned from recent acquisition actions and the extent to which
such lessons have been incorporated into CYBERCOM processes.
Integration of local initiatives, small business programs,
and academic institutions to limit gaps between training
events
The committee recognizes the critical importance of maintaining
continuous technical training and skill development throughout the
cyber operator pipeline within the Department of Defense (DOD).
The committee understands that training gaps are often inevitable
due to scheduling constraints, resource limitations, and the com-
plex nature of multi-phase cyber education programs.
The committee believes that while complete elimination of train-
ing interruptions may not be feasible, viable options exist to pre-
vent trainees from experiencing extended periods of downtime that
could result in skill degradation and compromised mission readi-
ness. The committee is aware that there are local initiatives, small
business partnerships, and academic collaborations that exist that
could be leveraged to bridge these gaps.
Accordingly, the committee encourages such partnerships with
small business programs and academic institutions that can offer
hands-on training in simulated environments, operational cyber
range experience, and targeted coursework to develop cyber talent.

The committee notes the Mississippi Cyber Initiative as an exam-
ple of an effective local partnership that provides valuable supple-
mentary training opportunities for servicemembers. The committee
believes these programs have the potential to enhance DOD capa-
bilities, address critical cybersecurity challenges, and strengthen
the national cyber workforce while ensuring cyber operators remain
technically proficient throughout their training pipeline.
Leveraging artificial intelligence-enabled training environ-
ments for cyber readiness
The committee encourages the Department of Defense (DOD) to
build upon its 2023 Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Adoption Strategy by leveraging machine learning and natural lan-
guage processing to create dynamic, threat-informed training envi-
ronments. The committee believes that these capabilities should
enable real-time, AI-generated threat scenarios for faster and more
adaptive military cyber training while also enabling realistic sim-
ulation of cyber-kinetic attack scenarios on military networks to en-
hance the protection of critical systems from foreign adversaries.
The committee assesses that adoption of these technologies may
strengthen national security posture across all domains through
agile, cost-effective, and scalable solutions that enable personnel to
engage with AI-driven adversaries in realistic, scenario-based as-
sessments.
The committee further recommends that the DOD prioritize in-
vestments in autonomous and adaptive learning platforms that in-
tegrate seamlessly with both on-premise infrastructure and com-
mercial cloud environments. By integrating AI-enabled platforms
into existing test and evaluation frameworks, the committee be-
lieves that the Department could accelerate the development of re-
silient cyber, space, and missile defense capabilities while signifi-
cantly reducing costs associated with traditional training models.
Modernization of Department of Air Force reserve compo-
nent business applications
The committee recognizes the critical importance of our nation’s
reserve components and their invaluable contributions to the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) and to national security. The com-
mittee has long been a strong advocate for ensuring that reserve
forces receive the necessary resources and support to maintain
peak readiness and operational effectiveness. The committee under-
stands that for reserve personnel to maximize their focus on readi-
ness and training activities during training status, they must be
supported by efficient and modern business support systems that
enable core administrative functions. The committee acknowledges
that streamlined processes for order generation, approval, and
other essential administrative tasks are fundamental to operational
success and personnel satisfaction.
The committee is deeply concerned with the poor state and clear
lack of investment in Air Force reserve component business sys-
tems, particularly the Unit Training Assembly Processing System
(UTAPS) and the Air Force Reserve Online Workflow System
(AROWS). The committee has received reports indicating that
these critical systems are extremely cumbersome to navigate and

operate, creating unnecessary administrative burdens for reserve
personnel who should be concentrating on mission-critical training
and readiness activities. The committee is further troubled that
these systems, due to insufficient updates and modernization ef-
forts, present significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could
compromise personnel information.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a comprehensive briefing outlining a detailed, one-year
modernization plan for core Air Reserve component business appli-
cations, including UTAPS and AROWS, not later than June 30,
2026, to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives. Such a plan should include specific fund-
ing requirements, detailed contract requirements and acquisition
strategies, and a robust user engagement and feedback component
to ensure continuous improvement and user satisfaction.
Multimodal generative artificial intelligence language trans-
lation capabilities
The committee recognizes artificial intelligence’s (AI) ability to
improve the Department of Defense’s warfighting posture, includ-
ing by providing enhanced foreign language translation capabili-
ties. Several military units are currently utilizing multimodal gen-
erative AI foreign language translation capabilities that include
text, audio, video, and image integrated with automated human-in-
the-loop review and verification processes that allow for mission-
specific, live fine-tuning. This capability is being used to great ef-
fect, augmenting linguists such that tasks that used to take a
month are now being completed in a few days. Such capabilities re-
sult in a high return on investment for a wide range of mission
areas, including joint exercises, intelligence, information oper-
ations, and counterintelligence investigations. The committee notes
that deployment of this technology is critical to ensure the
warfighter is fully equipped and that the Department is efficiently
utilizing resources to meet critical mission needs.
The committee is concerned that using humans to manually
translate virtually all foreign language media is an unsustainable
and high-cost effort that will never fully address the foreign lan-
guage translation needs of our forces without the assistance of
modern technology. Therefore, the committee encourages the Sec-
retary of Defense to invest in and utilize multimodal generative AI
foreign language translation capabilities that include automated
human-in-the-loop review and verification processes and built-in
mission-specific live fine-tuning, at scale across all services, com-
batant commands, and appropriate mission areas.
Munitions production decision support
The committee commends the Department of Defense for work-
ing diligently to try to increase munitions production goals to bet-
ter position the Department to prepare for future contingencies and
support its partners and allies. The committee is aware that efforts
such as the Joint Production Accelerator Cell and the Wartime Ac-
quisition and Sustainment Support Plan used by the Navy have in-
creased analytical support and attention to try to identify bottle-
necks in the process. However, the committee notes that, to date,

307
the processes used for capturing the outputs of such analyses, and
continuously updating and sharing such data, is startlingly anti-
quated and manually intensive for a data-powered organization
like the Department of Defense.
Accordingly, the committee believes it is critical for the Depart-
ment’s efforts to transition to an information technology-based deci-
sion support system or dashboard to better collect, analyze, vis-
ualize, and share information related to munitions production, pref-
erably linked with related processes for developing the munitions
requirements and operational planning tools in order to improve
the speed and scalability of planning and execution.
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy
resourcing
The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense
(DOD) is not adequately investing in and providing the resources
necessary to build out the Office of the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Cyber Policy (OASD(CP)) to match the statutory respon-
sibilities outlined by the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81) and the coordination needs
for that office. The committee recognizes that these resources are
needed to ensure that there is adequate technical, operational, and
policy experience in key areas that will build capabilities and a
workforce that is able to reestablish a credible cyber deterrent and
hold our adversaries at risk through the imposition of costs. Fur-
thermore, in order to meet its service-secretary-like responsibilities
to maintain civilian control over our cyber forces, as well as to fully
realize its intended benefits in workforce development, cyber capa-
bilities enhancement, and strategic deterrence implementation, this
office needs to be sized to exert similar oversight as a major func-
tional combatant command.
The committee is aware of a comprehensive resourcing study con-
ducted prior to the formal establishment of the OASD(CP). Accord-
ingly, building upon that initial study and reviewing its conclu-
sions, the committee directs the OASD(CP) to conduct an updated
resourcing study for the office. Such study should include: (1) A
thorough assessment of needed technical and operational experi-
ence requirements, both in terms of numbers of individuals as well
as types and diversity of skill disciplines needed; (2) A detailed
evaluation of limitations within existing Cyber Excepted Service
hiring authorities, as well as other hiring authorities available to
this office; (3) Recommendations for integration of Highly Qualified
Experts or special Government employees to provide unique
skillsets not readily available within the Government; and (4) Iden-
tification of various courses of action for future investments aligned
with the National Defense Strategy’s priorities.
The committee further directs that the Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Cyber Policy provide the report on the completed study
to the congressional defense committees, not later than January 31,
2026, and deliver a comprehensive briefing to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than March 31, 2026, on the study’s
findings, the courses of action presented to the Secretary, and the

Phishing-resistant authentication
The committee notes that the importance of protecting the De-
partment of Defense’s (DOD) systems and networks is underscored
by investment in the principles of zero trust, including managing
identity and access using phishing-resistant authentication. The
committee further notes that while the DOD has established a
process for approval of new multifactor authentication technologies,
to date few approvals appear to have made it through that process.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to de-
velop a strategy to ensure that phishing-resistant authentication,
which includes hardware-based public key infrastructure, is used
by all personnel of the DOD and to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, not later than May 1, 2026. The strategy shall include
an action plan for the deployment of phishing-resistant authentica-
tion across the DOD and retirement of legacy authentication tools
by the end of fiscal year 2027. The strategy should also include ex-
ceptions for applications in which the use of phishing-resistant au-
thentication is not feasible or practical and should require a proc-
ess for components seeking an exception to provide documentation
of an appropriate mitigation of the risk imposed by not using
phishing-resistant authentication.
Realignment of the Defense Cyber Crime Center
The committee recognizes the Department of Defense (DOD)
Cyber Crime Center (DC3) has a unique, multi-mission capability
supporting law enforcement, counterintelligence, cyber threat anal-
ysis, digital forensics, and defense industrial base (DIB) cybersecu-
rity incident response. The committee further notes that DC3 con-
tinues to serve as a national-level partner for cyber incident coordi-
nation and forensic support.
At the same time, the committee acknowledges the expanded re-
sponsibilities of the Department of Defense Cyber Defense Com-
mand (DCDC), which is tasked with the protection and operational
defense of the DOD Information Network (DODIN). In fulfilling
this mission, DCDC increasingly requires access to and awareness
of threats and trends affecting both the DODIN and interconnected
systems across the DIB, as well as mechanisms for enhanced en-
gagement and collaboration with those DIB partners on cybersecu-
rity threats and vulnerabilities.
The committee notes there is substantial functional alignment
between DC3 and DCDC in the following mission areas: (1) Cyber
incident analysis and coordination; (2) Digital forensics and
malware analysis; (3) Assessment of threats to DOD networks and
critical infrastructure; (4) Support to defensive cyberspace oper-
ations; and (5) Early warning and situational awareness related to
cyber intrusions and malicious cyber campaigns.
Given these shared mission areas, the committee believes it is es-
sential for the Department to ensure DCDC maintains a holistic
operational picture of threats to the DODIN, including those origi-
nating in the DIB or identified through digital forensics analysis.
The committee is concerned that failure to integrate or align rel-
evant elements of DC3 with DCDC could result in mission duplica-

tion, fragmented awareness of emerging threats, or the unneces-
sary development of parallel capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee urges the Secretary of Defense to as-
sess options to better align DC3 with DCDC, including through for-
mal coordination mechanisms, enhanced tasking authorities, or re-
vised organizational alignment. In doing so, the DOD should en-
sure continued support for DC3’s law enforcement and counter-
intelligence authorities while enabling DCDC to fully leverage
DC3’s existing capabilities in support of its operational mission.
Strategy for identifying and addressing blockchain
The committee recognizes that emerging cyber technologies like
blockchain pose significant threats. The committee is concerned
that the Department of Defense (DOD) currently lacks adequate ca-
pabilities to collect and analyze intelligence on blockchain applica-
tions and transactions. The committee notes this intelligence gap
leaves the DOD unable to effectively counter blockchain-enabled
activities including illicit trafficking of military dual-use tech-
nology, terrorism financing, sanctions evasion, and ransomware op-
erations that fund hostile military activities.
The committee believes the DOD needs a comprehensive
blockchain strategy that addresses four key areas: identification of
blockchain capabilities, risk and vulnerability analysis, threat miti-
gation, and capability development. The committee expects this
strategy to integrate the Department’s intelligence, cybersecurity,
and analytical capabilities to disrupt adversarial cyber operations,
counter illicit financial networks that threaten military security,
and guide strategic investments across the enterprise.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to de-
velop a strategy for analyzing blockchain technology applications—
including identifying classes of vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and
proposing mitigations and opportunities—and to brief the congres-
sional defense committees on the strategy, not later than July 1,
2026. Such strategy should include: (1) Options for streamlining
and formalizing investment and leveraging commercial tools for
blockchain analysis and utilization; (2) Policy and budgetary
changes needed to facilitate broader adoption of commercial
blockchain intelligence technologies; (3) Recommendations to better
enable real-time blockchain intelligence sharing and integration be-
tween the DOD and interagency and international partners; and
(4) Recommendations to enhance the traceability of foreign military
and state-sponsored cyber unit blockchain transactions targeting
U.S. defense and critical infrastructure.
Strategy for private cloud capabilities
The committee recognizes the Department of Defense has devel-
oped multiple cloud offerings to meet the diverse mission require-
ments of its components and military services. The Defense Infor-
mation Systems Agency (DISA) has made significant investments
in both commercial cloud solutions under the Joint Warfighting
Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract and private cloud infrastructure.
These private cloud environments provide many benefits similar to
public cloud solutions’ benefits, such as flexibility, agility,

scalability, and availability, while ensuring secure and controlled
deployments for sensitive missions.
The committee is aware that the Department is currently invest-
ing in enhancements to its private cloud capabilities, namely the
Stratus program, to provide improved options to mission partners.
However, the committee requires additional information regarding
how these investments will deliver unique capabilities not already
available through existing cloud offerings.
Therefore, the committee directs the Chief Information Officer of
the Department of Defense to provide a briefing to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than March 31, 2026, on the
Department’s comprehensive private cloud strategy. This briefing
should include: (1) Current status of existing private cloud platform
implementation; (2) Identification of opportunities for expanded
private cloud deployment; (3) Assessment of how private cloud in-
vestments complement public cloud capabilities; (4) Evaluation of
security and operational advantages of private cloud solutions; and
(5) Analysis of how the overall private cloud strategy advances data
protection, mission resilience, and cost and energy efficiencies with-
in the Department’s modernization efforts.
Time-based objectives for Department of Defense data re-
covery
The committee remains concerned that the United States faces
an intensifying and sophisticated national security threat, particu-
larly in the cyber domain, from the People’s Republic of China. The
committee is aware that malicious cyber actors increasingly target
backup systems and data repositories as part of coordinated at-
tacks against Department of Defense (DOD) networks and systems.
The committee notes that resilient and rapidly deployable data re-
covery mechanisms are necessary for DOD components to prevent
catastrophic and extended loss of mission-critical capabilities.
Accordingly, the committee directs the DOD Chief Information
Officer, in coordination with the DOD Chief Digital and Artificial
Intelligence Officer, to provide a briefing to the Committees on
Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than April 30, 2026, on a Department-wide evaluation of
existing policies and implementation guidance governing Recovery
Time Objective metrics for mission-essential data systems. Such
briefing should: (1) Examine current authoritative documentation
provided to the Department regarding maximum allowable restora-
tion timeframes following cyber compromise; (2) Identify systems
that currently satisfy established recovery time objective require-
ments; (3) Document the modern data recovery capabilities em-
ployed across the Department; and (4) Evaluate systems presenting
the highest vulnerability to cyber compromise. The briefing should
also include the development of recommendations for appropriate
recovery capabilities to mitigate identified technical and policy gaps
across the DOD enterprise.
Transition strategy for formal methods in software and
hardware development
The committee is concerned about the advancing sophistication,
scale, and speed of cyber threats targeting Department of Defense

(DOD) systems. The committee notes that formal methods and ap-
proaches for validation and verification, which establish mathe-
matical guarantees in software code, can be used to prove the ab-
sence of exploitable vulnerabilities. The committee also notes that
such approaches can and have also been used to secure hardware
systems as well, demonstrating even broader application of formal
methods.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense, acting through
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment,
the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the
Director for Operational Test and Evaluation, the Director of the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy, and the Department of
Defense Chief Information Officer, to develop a comprehensive
strategy for transitioning DARPA’s formal methods research in-
vestments into production environments across the DOD.
The committee directs that the strategy include the following ele-
ments: (1) Identification of high-priority software and hardware-
based platforms and systems for consideration for initial integra-
tion of formal methods approaches, with specific timelines and im-
plementation phases; (2) A description of integration pathways for
transitioning formal methods into both programs in sustainment
and newly acquired systems; (3) An assessment of necessary invest-
ments in workforce training, tooling, and infrastructure to enable
successful adoption of formal methods at scale; (4) Metrics to meas-
ure the effectiveness and return on investment of formal methods
implementation across different system types; and (5) Development
of incentives for industry to adopt such approaches for programs
they are developing.
Furthermore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives on this transition strategy, not
later than March 31, 2026, including specific resource require-
ments, policy recommendations, and implementation milestones.
United States Cyber Command dual-hat leadership arrange-
ment
The committee continues to assess the effectiveness of the dual-
hat leadership arrangement under which a single individual serves
as both the Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) and
the Director, National Security Agency (NSA). Established in 2010,
this structure was intended to improve operational integration and
alignment between the two organizations in support of national se-
curity objectives.
The committee notes that in 2022, the Secretary of Defense and
the Director of National Intelligence sponsored an interagency re-
view of the dual-hat arrangement. The study concluded that sepa-
rating the leadership roles would increase cost, reduce unity of ef-
fort, and result in less decisive national security outcomes. The
analysis further found that the existing arrangement enhances co-
ordination, accelerates decision-making, and achieves greater effi-
ciency in the employment of cyber and signals intelligence capabili-
ties.

The committee further notes that Congress increased its over-
sight of the NSA/CYBERCOM relationship in section 1556 of the
James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023 (Public Law 117–263), directing the Secretary of Defense
to provide annual briefings on the command relationship and oper-
ational coordination between the two organizations. This provision
amended sec. 1642 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328), limiting the ability to ter-
minate the dual-hat only following the satisfaction of certain condi-
tions that would have to be jointly certified by the Secretary of De-
fense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that such a de-
cision would not pose risks to the military effectiveness of
CYBERCOM that are unacceptable to the national security inter-
ests of the United States. To date, the Department of Defense has
yet to satisfy either provision.
The committee further notes that breaking up the dual-hat rela-
tionship would have significant risk at the strategic, operational,
and tactical level. The committee further acknowledges there would
also be cost impacts incurred by building the appropriate infra-
structure for two separate leadership organizations. The cost for
doing so has not yet been determined.
The committee believes that the dual-hat arrangement continues
to serve the best interests of U.S. national security and resource
stewardship and encourages the Department to maintain and
strengthen this structure.
The committee therefore directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on the in-
frastructure requirements and costs associated with changing or
potentially ending the dual-hat leadership arrangement, not later
than December 1, 2025.
Zero trust implementation
The committee appreciates recent updates on the progress made
by the Department of Defense (DOD) toward zero trust implemen-
tation but remains concerned that the DOD faces aggressive
timelines to adhere to the 2027 zero trust mandates directed by the
DOD Zero Trust Strategy. The committee believes that to achieve
goals within DOD-specified timelines, military departments, com-
batant commands, and other DOD components should leverage
scalable, security-certified, and managed services solutions like the
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) program,
Thunderdome, that went through an open vendor selection process
and comprehensive prototyping before production. Where a man-
aged solution does not effectively satisfy requirements, the com-
mittee believes that components should, to the greatest extent pos-
sible, leverage existing blanket purchase agreements and similar
DOD-wide procurement vehicles that offer easy and efficient access
to solutions at the appropriate security level. The committee under-
stands such solutions allow components to adopt the full range of
zero trust capabilities including edge computing, internet-of-things,
remote user access, and other technologies in a manner that best
integrates with the component’s existing security architecture and
requirements.

TITLE XXVIII—MILITARY CONSTRUCTION
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Subtitle A—Military Construction Program
Sec. 2801—Requirement for the military departments to de-
velop and annually update a 20-year infrastructure im-
provement plan
The committee recommends a provision that would require each

this provision to ensure that the departments’ senior leaders stra-
tegically and realistically budget for the sustainment of their in-
stallations and facilities.

332
Sec. 2805—Implementation of Comptroller General rec-
ommendations relating to information sharing to im-
prove oversight of military construction
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense to implement the recommendations of the
Government Accountability Office report, published September 16,
2024, titled, ‘‘Military Construction: Better Information Sharing
Would Improve DOD’s Oversight’’ (GAO–2024–106499), not later
than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, or to report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives explaining why the Secretary has not imple-
mented those recommendations.
Additionally, the committee directs the Secretary to provide a
one-time briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives, not later than March 1,
2026, on the status of implementing these recommendations.
Sec. 2806—Extension of requirement for contract for obliga-
tion and execution of design funds for military construc-
tion projects
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2811(a) of the Military Construction Authorization Act, Divi-
sion B of the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 (Public Law
118–159), by striking ‘‘150 days’’ and inserting ‘‘one year.’’

thorization of depot working capital funds for unspecified minor
military construction projects from 2025 to 2027.

Subtitle B—Military Housing
Sec. 2821—Improvements to annual reports of Department
of Defense on waivers of privacy and configuration
standards for covered military unaccompanied housing
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2856a of title 10, United States Code, by adding elements to
be included in future iterations of the barracks waiver reports sub-
mitted by the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD and the
military services have made progress toward improving unaccom-
panied housing, but the committee remains concerned that many
servicemembers continue to be housed in substandard conditions,
as described by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a
report published on September 19, 2023, titled ‘‘Military Barracks:
Poor Living Conditions Undermine Quality of Life and Readiness’’
(GAO–23–105797).
Additionally, in accordance with the requirements of section 2833
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024
(Public Law 118–31), the GAO provided the committee with a brief-
ing on the first DOD report submitted under section 2856a of title
10, United States Code, which revealed certain limitations in the
current report requirements. The provision would improve and
strengthen future iterations of the report so that it provides infor-
mation vital to improvement in the long-term conditions of bar-
racks across the services.
Sec. 2822—Modification of Housing Requirements and Mar-
ket Analysis to account for impact of civilians and con-
tractors
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2837(d) of title 10, United States Code, to account for impacts
of civilians and contractors of the Department of Defense.
Sec. 2823—Authority for unaccompanied housing project
under pilot authority for use of other transactions for
installation or facility prototyping
The committee recommends a provision that would grant permis-
sive authority to the Secretary of Defense to conduct an unaccom-
panied housing project under section 4022(i) of title 10, United
States Code.
Sec. 2824—Elimination of indoor residential mold in housing
of Department of Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for Health Affairs, the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to con-
duct a comprehensive study on the health effects of indoor residen-
tial mold growth in military unaccompanied housing or other hous-
ing on military installations.

Sec. 2825—Requirement for disclosure of information relat-
ing to liability insurance and dispute resolutions relat-
ing to privatized military housing
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2891c(a)(2) of title 10, United States Code, by requiring land-
lords of privatized military housing units to disclose to the Sec-
retary of Defense information relating to insurance coverage and
payments for dispute resolutions with tenants.
Sec. 2826—Treatment of nondisclosure agreements with re-
spect to privatized military housing
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2890(f) of title 10, United States Code, to prohibit a landlord
from requesting that a tenant or prospective tenant of a privatized
housing unit sign a nondisclosure agreement.
Subtitle C—Land Conveyances
Sec. 2831—Authorization to acquire through exchange or
lease certain land used by the Armed Forces in Hawaii
The committee recommends a provision that would temporarily
authorize the Department of Defense to acquire mission critical
military training lands that are currently leased by the military de-
partments from the State of Hawaii. The committee’s intent for
this provision would be to address the multiple military training
ranges across Hawaii that have expiring leases in the near future.
Sec. 2832—Report on land withdrawals
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of the Army to submit a report on certain land with-
drawals.
Subtitle D—Other Matters
Sec. 2841—Modifications to Defense Community Infrastruc-
ture Program
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2391(d)(1)(B) of title 10, United States Code, to modify the pri-
ority list and definitions for Defense Community Infrastructure
Program projects.
Sec. 2842—Designation of Ronald Reagan Space and Missile
Test Range at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands
The committee recommends a provision that would redesignate
the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site as the Ron-
ald Reagan Space and Missile Test Range to better reflect the
range’s broader role in supporting the development and operation
of long-range missile systems, defenses, and space capabilities.
Sec. 2843—Joint base facility management of Department of
Defense
The committee recommends a provision that would improve the
Department of Defense’s (DOD) facility management of joint bases.

The committee notes that preliminary findings from an ongoing
Government Accountability Office (GAO) report show that the DOD
has faced challenges in ensuring that the 12 joint bases are man-
aging the sustainment, restoration, and modernization of their fa-
cilities to support mission needs. The GAO also notes that the DOD
facilities are requiring more work to maintain, due to facility age,
accumulated deferred maintenance, and older systems such as
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The committee notes
that the DOD has not provided consistent and clear guidance on
facility maintenance responsibilities and funding. In the absence of
guidance specific to joint base management, each joint base is ap-
proaching issues such as facility management in a fragmented
manner, and this has led to issues such as lingering disputes about
how to fund critical infrastructure needs. The DOD also has been
unable to determine how funding for facility maintenance is allo-
cated among military components on joint bases. This has pre-
vented the DOD from completing a determination of whether there
is any funding discrepancy between the joint base components and
whether any such discrepancy is negatively impacting mission
readiness. Further, the DOD has not regularly assessed whether
they have the staff that is needed to meet changing requirements
and to keep DOD facilities in good working order to support the
mission and provide servicemembers with good quality of life.
Sec. 2844—Limitation on use of amounts for travel based on
compliance with requirements related to minimum cap-
ital investment
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit both
the service secretary and service chief of a military department
from using any funds to travel outside of the continental United
States should their respective military department not be in com-
pliance with section 2680 of title 10, United States Code.
The committee notes the minimum facilities sustainment funding
set forth in section 2680 will be specifically used for maintaining
existing infrastructure as well as demolition funding to dispose of
excess inventory. The committee encourages Department of De-
fense senior leadership to review and utilize existing authorities to
improve its facility backlog.
Sec. 2845—Extension of prohibition on joint use of Home-
stead Air Reserve Base with civil aviation
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2874 of the Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023, Division B of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117–253), by strik-
ing ‘‘September 30, 2028,’’ and inserting ‘‘September 30, 2034’’.
Sec. 2846—Pilot program on procurement of utility services
for installations of the Department of Defense through
areawide contracts
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Defense to establish a pilot program for the purposes
of the military departments to procure utility services from an
areawide contract with a public utility provider. The provision

sition the authority to a permanent status.
The committee notes that under this pilot program, the Secretary
of each military department must enter into at least one areawide
contract within 180 days of the date of the enactment of this Act.
Sec. 2847—Authorization for monetary contributions to the
conveyees of utility systems for infrastructure improve-
ments
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 2688(k) of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the De-
partment of Defense to pair utilities privatization with the Energy
Resilience and Conservation Investment Program.
Sec. 2848—Prohibition on use of funds for development of
Greenbury Point Conservation Area at Naval Support
Activity Annapolis, Maryland
The committee recommends a provision that would prohibit the
use of funds for development of Greenbury Point Conservation Area
at Naval Support Activity Annapolis, Maryland.
Sec. 2849—Application of certain authorities and standards
to historic military housing and associated historic
properties of the Department of the Navy and the De-
partment of the Air Force
The committee recommends a provision that would amend title
54, United States Code, to apply certain authorities and standards
to historic military housing and associated historic properties of the
Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force.
Items of Special Interest
B–21 bomber shelter strategy
The committee notes that the Servicemember Quality of Life Im-
provement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 (Public Law 118–159) required the Secretary of the Air Force
to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on
the suitability of open-sided environmental protection shelters
(EPSs) in comparison to traditional hangars for B–21 bomber air-
craft operating out of installations that are at risk of severe weath-
er events. The committee notes that the briefing shows the poten-
tial of EPSs in terms of cost savings and accelerating construction
time. The committee notes the Air Force stated that building tradi-
tional hangars instead would cost an additional $3.0 billion in mili-
tary construction funding and $8.3 billion in life-cycle sustainment
costs. The committee understands that EPSs can also improve bed-
down times by a number of years, which will increase operational
readiness. The committee finally notes that while there are cases
where a traditional hangar is preferred, such as in extreme cold or
blizzards, the Air Force noted that EPSs are the preferred solution
with a small mix of traditional hangars.

The committee believes the Air Force should continue to focus on
EPS as an alternative to traditional hangar construction depending
on the operational mission requirement.
Civilian housing at public naval shipyards
The committee is aware that the availability and affordability of
housing in communities surrounding the public naval shipyards is
relevant to the ability of the government to recruit and retain
skilled shipyard workers. Therefore, the committee directs the Sec-
retary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy
and the Director of the Office of Industrial Policy of the Depart-
ment of Defense, and informed by the operational commanders of
shipyard workers and commanders who manage shore infrastruc-
ture, to provide a report to the congressional defense committees,
not later than September 30, 2027, on the feasibility, costs, and
benefits of providing apartment-style or dormitory housing units
for civilian workers at the four public naval shipyards, to include:
(1) An assessment of the estimated costs of constructing,
maintaining, and leasing apartment-style or dormitory housing
units for civilian workers at public naval shipyards;
(2) An assessment of the potential economic and workforce
effects of providing such housing units, including on recruit-
ment and retention rates;
(3) An assessment of the feasibility of providing such housing
units, including the timeline required for implementation;
(4) An assessment of the operational effects of providing such
housing units, including on worker availability, morale, and
commuting burdens;
(5) An assessment of the effect of providing such housing
units on the housing market in surrounding areas, including
for non-shipyard workers;
(6) Options for deducting fair-market rent or below-market
housing fees directly from employee paychecks, including ad-
ministrative, legal, and contractual implications;
(7) Comparisons with similar workforce housing models used
by the Department of Defense or other Federal agencies; and
(8) Case studies of at least two covered naval shipyards that
include specific data on the potential effectiveness of providing
apartment-style or dormitory housing units for civilian workers
at such shipyards.
For the purposes of the report, the public naval shipyards shall
be considered to be:
(1) Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia;
(2) Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Mainte-
nance Facility, Hawaii;
(3) Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Maine; and
(4) Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Mainte-
nance Facility, Washington.
Clarification of inclusion of certain energy production fa-
cilities in authority for contracts for energy or fuel for
military installations

any facilities that produce energy, including but not limited to,
electrical, chemical, thermal, mechanical, and nuclear energy. Ad-
ditionally, the only limiting factor to the committee not specifically
amending section 2922a of title 10, United States Code, to this end
is a direct spending score by the Congressional Budget Office. Last-
ly, the committee intends for the Department of Defense to inter-
pret this statute as such, especially as it relates to area-wide con-
tracts and other non-Department funded energy projects.
Comptroller General review of maintenance of general and
flag officer quarters
The committee is concerned with how the Department of Defense
(DOD) manages the maintenance of General and Flag Officer Quar-
ters (GFOQs), in particular the planning and costs for maintenance
of these units. Generally, the military services’ GFOQs are older
and larger than typical military family housing, and many of these
properties are historic, with some dating back to the early 19th
century. These factors make general and flag officer homes costly
to maintain.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on cost in-
creases in GFOQ renovation projects and raised questions about
the military services’ management of these units over 20 years ago,
in a report published on May 17, 2004, titled ‘‘Issues Related to the
Renovation of General and Flag Officer Quarters’’ (GAO–04–555).
In that 2004 report, the GAO found that requests for changes to
housing units—typically from the quarters’ occupant or the instal-
lation’s command officials—and unforeseen repairs were the pri-
mary reasons for cost increases to GFOQ renovation projects. Un-
planned repairs, such as for termite damage or unexpected historic
preservation requirements, had occurred because problems were
not identified during home inspections.
The committee remains concerned about unforeseen maintenance
of GFOQs. Accordingly, the committee directs the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States to assess the following: (1) The policies,
process, and procedures for maintaining GFOQs; (2) The extent to
which the military services effectively plan for major repairs and
manage requests for changes to these homes while balancing other
maintenance installation priorities; (3) The primary factors that
have contributed to cost increases for GFOQ maintenance and to
what extent the DOD has assessed the causes of the cost increases;
and (4) Any other matters the Comptroller General determines ap-
propriate related to this topic.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of
the Senate and the House of Representatives on preliminary find-
ings from this assessment, by not later than March 1, 2026, and
determine a mutually agreed upon timeframe to communicate the
final results.
Coordination of advanced nuclear efforts
The committee supports ongoing efforts by the Department of
Defense (DOD) to invest in advanced nuclear capability and en-
courages endeavors to bring those efforts into strategic alignment.
The committee notes that adversaries, namely the People’s Repub-

lic of China and the Russian Federation, have recognized the criti-
cality of civil nuclear energy. As a result, they are investing vast
state resources in developing and deploying the next generation of
nuclear reactors while actively pursuing long-term global contracts
for nuclear energy. The committee believes it is critical that the
DOD leads in the development and deployment of nuclear reactors
to prevent our adversaries from monopolizing control of related
supply chains, both to prevent adversaries from achieving such geo-
political leverage and to ensure that our own critical infrastructure
is not dependent on adversary technology. The DOD faces unprece-
dented power needs and will need civil nuclear technology to en-
sure agile, resilient, secure, and uninterrupted power to critical
missions and to military installations and operations, in particular
in austere and unique environments. The DOD must act swiftly
both to secure its own military installations and to ensure the DOD
leads in the development and deployment of civil nuclear tech-
nology.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Under Secretary of De-
fense for Acquisition and Sustainment, in coordination with the
Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not later than Novem-
ber 1, 2026, to brief the congressional defense committees on op-
tions for establishing and executing an advanced nuclear energy
technical project support program of record. At a minimum, the
briefing should include: (1) The likely use cases for advanced nu-
clear energy, including micro-reactors, with coordinated input from
combatant commands to establish operational and installation
needs, including the support of force electrification, base
sustainment, elimination of fuel supply vulnerabilities, addressing
climate threats, enabling multi-domain operations, and advanced
weaponry, at the secret level; (2) The process for establishing re-
quirements for a program of record; (3) The estimated minimum
number of units needed to establish a cost-effective program and
minimize the time to Initial Operational Capability; (4) The max-
imum number of units with assumptions on which operational
plans are in effect; (5) The process for establishing a comprehensive
regulatory framework for DOD-managed advanced reactors and the
deployment of pilot nuclear reactors for installations; (6) Estimates
on fuel requirements to support deployment models; and (7) The
expected annual budget required to transition the Project Pele
demonstration, as well as programmatic budget needs for the pro-
gram of record through 2030 or through the first 5 years in which
advanced nuclear energy, including micro-reactors, is deployed for
operational and installation energy, whichever is longer.
Feasibility study on potential land use of Pentagon Reserva-
tion
The committee notes that in May 2024 the National Capital
Planning Commission approved a Pentagon Reservation master
plan update, outlining proposed improvements to the Pentagon and
nearby Department of Defense (DOD) property. Among the ele-
ments of this plan is the potential reuse of some DOD land adja-
cent to Pentagon City, Virginia. The revised master plan, in ele-
ment 3.5.4, identifies this land for future development under

mixed-use or supportive purposes, saying it should be, ‘‘considered
for land use types that provide a more positive impact than surface
parking.’’ It also notes that the ‘‘economic development dynamics of
Pentagon City along with the potential benefits to the Pentagon
suggest strongly that further study of this area should be con-
ducted to identify the most appropriate use for these sites.’’ Given
security and financial suitability needs, the plan states that ‘‘fur-
ther study of this area should be conducted to identify the most ap-
propriate use for these sites.’’
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the
House of Representatives a one-time briefing, not later than March
1, 2026, on the potential use of DOD land adjacent to the Pentagon
Reservation fronting Army Navy Drive in Arlington, Virginia, cur-
rently being used as parking lots. The briefing should reflect the
contents of element 3.5.4 of the 2024 Pentagon Reservation master
plan update and balance the needs of sound fiscal planning, secu-
rity, sustainable land use, and military families. Lastly, the brief-
ing should identify next steps and associated funding requirements.
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning replacement at
Luke Air Force Base
The committee understands that Luke Air Force Base (AFB) re-
quires upgraded heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
systems. The committee notes that, due to the Air Force’s inability
to properly budget for facility sustainment funding, HVAC systems
across Luke AFB are aged and now need replacement. The com-
mittee understands that temperatures in the Phoenix, Arizona,
area, also known as ‘‘America’s Hottest City,’’ can approach 120 de-
grees Fahrenheit. The committee notes that operating older, less
efficient HVAC systems in areas experiencing extreme heat may
result in higher operating and maintenance costs. The committee
is concerned that this poses a safety and readiness issue—impact-
ing airmen’s ability to work effectively in high heat—and a fiscal
inefficiency.
Accordingly, the committee urges the Secretary of the Air Force
to include appropriate funds when planning the Air Force’s budget
for fiscal year 2027.
Impacts to energy and water utilities on military installa-
tions
The committee notes that Department of Defense (DOD) installa-
tions need to be resilient against extreme weather events and chal-
lenges. The committee further notes that military installations
need to ensure that basic functions remain operational so the pri-
mary mission of the installation is not under threat from interrup-
tion of energy and water utilities. The DOD needs to be able to bet-
ter understand in detail the exposure their facilities have to ex-
treme weather events and how the impacts of such events may
limit military operations, pose risk to DOD utilities, and under-
mine readiness.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
coordination with the Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, to
provide a one-time briefing to the committee, not later than March

1, 2026, on the potential risk exposure of water and energy utilities
at military installations in the Indo-Pacific as a result of extreme
weather events. The briefing should include: (1) A categorized list
of incidents or malfunctions that led to a major disruption of water
or energy services as a result of extreme weather and impeded the
utilities at installations from functioning properly; (2) An assess-
ment of military installations in the Indo-Pacific that are at risk
of energy and water utility disruptions due extreme weather events
and mitigating actions those installations took to reduce this risk;
(3) A list of DOD policies and statutes that inhibit installation com-
manders’ ability to better prepare and develop military installation
resilience strategies to address the vulnerability of water and en-
ergy utilities to extreme weather events; and (4) An assessment of
how the design of water and energy utility infrastructure on DOD
installations is being adjusted to account for extreme weather
events.
Implementation of increased architecture and engineering
design fee limitation
The committee notes that the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) raised the architec-
ture and engineering (A&E) design fee limit from 6 percent to 10
percent of estimated construction costs for Department of Defense
projects. While Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
48 Code of Federal Regulations part 236 was amended on June 27,
2024, implementation has been inconsistent, with some contracting
officers unaware of the update. This lack of awareness has led to
delays and hindered firms from fully benefiting from the revised
limitation. To ensure full implementation, the Secretary of Defense
should issue acquisition, program objective memoranda, and budget
guidance to all services to ensure consistent application of the new
fee limitation, reflect the revised fee limit in future budgets, and
train contracting officers and acquisition personnel on compliance.
The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report
to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, not later than December 1, 2025, on the De-
partment’s efforts to ensure full implementation of this change.
Infrastructure support for the 185th Air Refueling Wing
The committee remains concerned about infrastructure limita-
tions affecting the operational readiness of the 185th Air Refueling
Wing (ARW), a critical National Guard unit supporting global aer-
ial refueling missions. Located at a dual-use facility not owned by
the Department of Defense, the 185th ARW relies on non-federal
infrastructure for mission execution. These limitations have re-
stricted the Department’s ability to invest in necessary upgrades to
sustain readiness and future mission requirements.
The Department has historically faced challenges in using mili-
tary construction funds to support infrastructure it does not di-
rectly own. However, the 185th ARW’s reliance on such facilities
presents a unique case where readiness and strategic capacity may
be weakened without targeted investment and coordination. Pro-
grams such as the Defense Community Infrastructure Program

(DCIP), cooperative agreements, or other legal authorities may
offer pathways for resolving these infrastructure gaps.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to pro-
vide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, not later than April 1, 2026, on
the Department’s plan to: (1) Preserve the operational readiness of
the 185th ARW, including support for current and projected mis-
sion requirements; (2) Identify infrastructure challenges associated
with the unit’s reliance on non-federally owned facilities; (3) Assess
available legal authorities and potential legislative changes that
would enable the Department to contribute to infrastructure mod-
ernization efforts, including the use of programs such as the DCIP;
(4) Describe any current or planned mitigation efforts, such as
partnerships with state or local governments; and (5) Provide rec-
ommendations for congressional action.
Installation energy demands in Indo-Pacific
The committee notes the energy demands of operating in a for-
ward environment not only in peacetime but especially in a con-
tested environment. The committee notes that if the Department of
Defense (DOD) assessed potential opportunities to partner with key
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to develop geothermal en-
ergy, it could help meet its growing energy demands and provide
crucial information for future infrastructure planning.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to
provide a one-time briefing to the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee, not later than March 1, 2026, with an assessment of oppor-
tunities for the DOD to develop geothermal energy across the Indo-
Pacific that could increase deterrence, promote energy and national
security, and boost exports of U.S. technologies. The briefing should
include: (1) An assessment of countries and regions in the Indo-Pa-
cific in which the development or expansion of geothermal energy
is most beneficial to the DOD’s security interests, including in sup-
port of U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy, and most feasible based on fac-
tors such as existing geothermal production or exploration, sub-
surface data, regulatory and economic conditions, energy demand,
and workforce quality; (2) An assessment of the benefits of addi-
tional geothermal production on military installations that could
improve energy reliability, affordability, security, and reduced reli-
ance on adversaries; (3) An assessment of the barriers to the devel-
opment and expansion of geothermal energy on military installa-
tions; (4) An assessment of the potential for the DOD’s competitive
advantage in the development and export of next-generation geo-
thermal technologies; and (5) A recommendation for whether to es-
tablish a pilot program for the DOD to promote geothermal energy
internationally and the resources necessary for such a program.
Integrated project delivery
The committee is concerned that the military services have not
incorporated best practices from the private sector into military
construction (MILCON) projects. Section 2814 of the James M.
Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023
(Public Law 117–263) required the Secretary of the Army, the Sec-
retary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force to each enter

into at least one integrated project delivery project. The committee
has not received any information to indicate the military services
complied with this requirement.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Naval Facilities Engi-
neering Systems Command commissioned a study and report by a
third-party to determine the MILCON Cost Premium and under-
lying cost drivers, which was published on April 28, 2025. The
study concluded that there is a significant cost premium associated
with military construction when compared to private sector con-
struction of similar facilities. The study included several rec-
ommendations to reduce the MILCON cost premium, among which
was the adoption of best practices from the private sector, includ-
ing the use of integrated project delivery that uses open-book pric-
ing, enhanced collaboration, and the use of an integrated project
team. The committee agrees that increasing collaboration and shar-
ing of risk and rewards could contribute to the on-time and on-
budget delivery of MILCON projects.
Therefore, the committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment to provide a briefing to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, not later than March 1, 2026, on the
feasibility and advisability of using integrated project delivery for
MILCON projects, to include:
(1) A comprehensive list of any legal or regulatory barriers
to the use of integrated project delivery, including associated
waiver authorities;
(2) A strategy for training the workforce for awarding and
managing construction employing integrated project delivery;
(3) A detailed explanation of the challenges and opportuni-
ties of using integrated project delivery; and
(4) An explanation for the Department of Defense’s failure to
comply with section 2814 of the James M. Inhofe National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.
Intergovernmental service agreements for unaccompanied
housing
The committee notes that the Department of Defense continues
to face challenges meeting unaccompanied housing needs across
the services, especially in regions with high concentrations of
servicemembers. The committee is aware of proposals to use Inter-
governmental Service Agreements (IGSAs) to lease unaccompanied
housing units. The committee believes that this approach could
provide additional unaccompanied housing options, increasing sup-
ply faster than traditional methods.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in
coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,
Installations, and Environment, to provide a briefing to the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, not later than March 1, 2026. The briefing shall in-
clude but not be limited to:
(1) The viability of using IGSAs to lease unaccompanied
housing;
(2) Funding models, to include the use of basic allowance for
housing funds to fund the leases;

(3) A sample of military installations that could benefit from
this model; and
(4) Any scoring implications that would hinder congressional
action for a future pilot authority.
Mold kits
The committee believes that it is essential for the Department of
Defense to continue to examine and improve quality-of-life initia-
tives for our servicemembers. Specifically, as it relates to housing
under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, the committee
is concerned regarding ongoing reports of mold inside housing
owned and operated by private contractors.
Accordingly, the committee strongly encourages the Board of Di-
rectors for each service exchange system to maintain ready stock
at all locations, where feasible and consistent with operational ca-
pabilities, of at-home environmental testing kits. These kits should
enable military families to detect and identify potential health haz-
ards in housing environments. The Secretary of Defense shall pro-
vide a written report to the Senate Armed Services Committee, not
later than March 1, 2026, that includes, at a minimum:
(1) The percentage of military exchange locations carrying
at-home environmental testing kits by product type;
(2) A list of military exchange locations selling these kits;
(3) A plan to keep the kits readily available at military ex-
changes; and
(4) Any challenges or costs associated with maintaining at-
home environmental testing kits.
Requirement for Camp Navajo entry bridge repairs
The committee notes that in the event of a conflict, it is critical
to have reliable access to munitions in storage and the ability to
expediently ship munitions. The committee acknowledges that the
transport of munitions often relies on rail transportation to expedi-
tiously move munitions from the interior of the United States to
munition ports to be shipped outside the contiguous United States
to the theater of operations.
The committee acknowledges that properly maintaining the in-
frastructure, such as bridges and overpasses, at military installa-
tions operating munitions storage missions along the Strategic Rail
Corridor Network, including Camp Navajo in Bellemont, Arizona,
is important for our national security. However, the condition and
size of the current bridge limits the portion of the strategic na-
tional rail line underneath the overpass to one lane of travel, cre-
ating a limiting factor to support contingencies, logistics, and re-
supply in the Indo-Pacific area of responsibility.
Accordingly, the committee urges the U.S. Army and the U.S.
Army National Guard to prioritize military construction and
sustainment funding to replace and sustain the bridge network
contained within the Department of Defense’s jurisdiction.

threaten to destroy traditional wood or concrete utility poles, leav-
ing military installations without power and unable to accomplish
basic functions. However, composite utility poles capable of with-
standing the effects of extreme weather could offer a more resilient
and cost-effective alternative over the long term.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to
conduct an assessment and provide a one-time briefing to the com-
mittee, not later than March 1, 2026, to identify Department of De-
fense locations where modular composite utility poles will improve
grid resilience, reduce pole failures, and decrease life-cycle costs
compared to traditional wood utility poles. The assessment and
briefing should include the identification of locations on military in-
stallations that have experienced utility pole failures and electrical
outages due to excessive ice loading, hurricane-force winds, or
wildfires. Lastly, the assessment and briefing should include the
consideration of environmental moisture, such as from swamps and
wetlands, and wildlife interference and corruption as additional
factors in assessing electrical equipment failure.
Yuma Proving Ground
The committee is aware of the substandard conditions of Pole
Line Road, an interior test road running through Yuma Proving
Ground. The committee wishes to underscore the importance of
maintaining road safety, in particular on testing grounds, where
personnel often operate in small teams and maneuver critical and
expensive testing equipment.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Army to
conduct an estimate cost analysis to repair the existing Pole Line
Road and an estimate cost analysis to replace Pole Line Road. Cost
estimates and analyses should include impacts to the status quo
and further road degradation on mission success and personnel
safety. The committee further directs the U.S. Army to provide a
one-time briefing to the committee, not later than March 1, 2026,
on the results of these cost analyses.

Sec. 3104—Nuclear energy
The committee recommends a provision that would authorize the
appropriation of funds for the Department of Energy’s nuclear en-
ergy activities.
Subtitle B—Program Authorizations, Restrictions, and
Limitations
Sec. 3111—Organization and codification of provisions of
law relating to atomic energy defense activities
The committee recommends a provision that would improve leg-
islative and implementation efficiency by consolidating the existing
conglomeration of provisions that constitute the Atomic Energy De-
fense Act as found under 50 United States Code Chapter 42 (10
U.S.C. 2501 et seq.) into a single new chapter 552 of title 10,
United States Code, as a matter of positive law.
Sec. 3112—Adjustment to plutonium pit production capacity
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4219 of the Atomic Energy Defense Act (50 U.S.C. 2538a) to
adjust the by year and full rate production requirements for the
Department of Energy to produce war reserve plutonium pits at

the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah River Plu-
tonium Processing Facility.
The committee recognizes that dramatic shifts in the inter-
national security environment have compelled the Department of
Defense to reassess anticipated nuclear weapons stockpile require-
ments, which are likely to levy additional production needs on the
nuclear security enterprise beyond the original targets established
in 2015. As such, the committee acknowledges that the 80 pits per
year production target is likely insufficient to facilitate timely mod-
ernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile in a manner that
preserves deterrence against growing threats from China, Russia,
and North Korea. In order to effectively establish realistic targets
within this legislative cycle, the Congress requires updated assess-
ments of projected annual production rate requirements for pluto-
nium pits. These assessments will inform conference negotiations
for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026.
Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, act-
ing through the Chair of the Nuclear Weapons Council, to brief the
congressional defense committees on the results of an updated an-
nual, full-rate production target for plutonium pits, encompassing
both the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah River
Plutonium Processing Facility, not later than August 1, 2025.
Sec. 3113—National Nuclear Security Administration Rapid
Capabilities Development Office
The committee recommends a provision that would restructure
the existing National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)
Stockpile Responsiveness Program established by section 4220 of
the Atomic Energy Defense Act (50 U.S.C. 2538b) into an Office of
Rapid Capabilities Development to improve the responsiveness of
the NNSA to rapidly evolving international security conditions and
Department of Defense requirements.
Sec. 3114—Review and assessment of the National Nuclear
Security Administration Enterprise Blueprint
The committee recommends a provision that would direct the
Chair of the Nuclear Weapons Council to lead a review of the Octo-
ber 2024 National Nuclear Security Administration Enterprise
Blueprint and submit a one-time report to the congressional de-
fense committees, not later than June 1, 2026, on the Council’s as-
sessment of the adequacy of the Enterprise Blueprint to meet fu-
ture Department of Defense requirements.
Sec. 3115—Notification of cost overruns for certain Depart-
ment of Energy projects
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4713 of subtitle A of title XLVII of the Atomic Energy Defense
Act (50 U.S.C. 2753), ‘‘Notification of cost overruns for certain De-
partment of Energy projects,’’ with certain technical and con-
forming amendments pertaining to reporting as well as stockpile
design processes.

tection of certain nuclear facilities and assets,’’ to include facilities
operated by contractors of the National Nuclear Security Adminis-
tration.
Sec. 3117—Extension of authority for appointment of certain
scientific, engineering, and technical personnel
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sec-
tion 4601(c) of the Atomic Energy Defense Act (50 U.S.C. 2701) to
extend the existing authority for the appointment of certain per-
sonnel through September 30, 2036.
Sec. 3118—Appropriate scoping of artificial intelligence re-
search within the National Nuclear Security Administra-
tion
The committee recommends a provision that would amend sub-
title B of title XLVIII of the Atomic Energy Defense Act that funds
be authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to
the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for the pur-
poses of artificial intelligence research may only be used to support
NNSA’s nuclear security missions.
Subtitle C—Other Matters
Sec. 3121—National security positions within the Depart-
ment of Energy
The committee recommends a provision that would require posi-
tions funded under Office of Management and Budget functional
subcategory 053, Atomic Energy Defense Activities, to be consid-
ered necessary to meet national security responsibilities.
Sec. 3122—Office of Environmental Management program-
wide performance metrics for reducing risk
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Energy to develop and implement additional program
performance metrics to supplement the existing metrics of the Of-
fice of Environmental Management’s (EM) ‘‘EM Program Plan
2022.’’ This is in addition to revising the metrics identified in ‘‘EM
Program Plan 2022’’ to incorporate all metrics developed under
subsection (a) of this provision.
The provision would further direct the Secretary of Energy to re-
port to the congressional defense committees on its annual
progress—as measured against its performance metrics, including
all metrics developed under subsection (a) of this provision and all
other metrics described in the ‘‘EM Program Plan 2022,’’ as revised
as appropriate—1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act

Sec. 3123—Office of Environmental Management integrated
radioactive waste disposal planning and optimization
The committee recommends a provision that would require the
Secretary of Energy to develop complex-wide analyses identifying
optimal disposal pathways and schedules for radioactive waste
managed by the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental
Management. The provision would further require the Secretary to
submit to the congressional defense committees the results of opti-

assesses infrastructure investments necessary to meet the demands
of the National Nuclear Security Administration’s nuclear stock-
pile, global security, and naval nuclear propulsion missions.
Items of Special Interest
Accelerating cleanup milestones at Los Alamos National
Laboratory
The committee notes that Los Alamos National Laboratory has
long-standing sub-surface ground water contamination issues, asso-
ciated with chromium and explosives testing, that will take decades
to remediate.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Energy to brief
the congressional defense committees, not later than March 31,
2026, on recommended actions that can be taken to accelerate
cleanup milestones with the State of New Mexico at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, including chromium plume control interim
measures to control migration of a hexavalent chromium plume
and progress on the groundwater remedies for the Royal Demoli-
tion Explosive (RDX) plume in Can˜on de Valle.
Briefing on Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program
The committee remains concerned about the proliferation of nu-
clear and radiological materials.
Therefore, the committee directs the National Nuclear Security
Administration’s Administrator for Nuclear Security, not later than
June 1, 2026, to provide a one-time briefing to the congressional
defense committees on developments in the global security environ-
ment over the past 18 months regarding: (1) Persistent threats of
state and non-state actors seeking to obtain nuclear and radio-
logical materials; (2) State actors potentially undermining non-
proliferation regimes and arms control agreements to which the
United States is adherent; and (3) Increased risks of the avail-

ability of nuclear and radiological materials as a result of detected
lapses in global nuclear security mechanisms.
Briefing on feasibility of public-private partnerships to sup-
port modernization of National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration high-yield experimentation capabilities
The committee notes that the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration’s (NNSA) high-yield experimentation capabilities, like
much of the NNSA’s infrastructure, is in need of modernization to
meet the needs of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and ensure
the NNSA retains a robust scientific base across all disciplines re-
lating to high-energy physics. To alleviate continually increasing
fiscal and programmatic pressures on the NNSA and its workforce,
the committee believes that innovative approaches to developing
and resourcing future capabilities should be explored.
Therefore, the committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear
Security to provide the congressional defense committees with a
one-time briefing, not later than November 1, 2025, on the feasi-
bility of initiating a program to update existing high-yield experi-
mentation facilities or build replacement facilities through the use
of public-private partnerships. The briefing should address, at a
minimum: (1) An assessment of the capability of potential private
industry partners to effectively contribute to the modernization of
NNSA high-yield experimentation capabilities; (2) A review of ex-
isting statutory authorities for conducting a public-private partner-
ship for such purposes; (3) An evaluation of possible siting options
for the construction of new facilities, as necessary; and (4) An ini-
tial cost and schedule projection for recapitalizing existing facilities
or constructing new facilities.
Comptroller General review of Defense Nuclear Non-
proliferation legacy nuclear security programs
The committee notes that following the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the Department of Energy initiated a range of cooperative
nuclear and radiological material security programs with Russia
and the other former Soviet states. Among other things, these ef-
forts included programs to improve the security of facilities with
weapon-usable nuclear materials and radiological sources, to re-
move or consolidate materials to fewer locations, and to detect and
interdict smuggling of materials across borders. Following the es-
tablishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration
(NNSA) in 2000 and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
these efforts were expanded on a global scale. Significant progress
was made over the past two decades to reduce nuclear and radio-
logical risks worldwide.
Given this progress, the committee would like more information
about whether the significant amount of funding that is still dedi-
cated every year to these efforts under the NNSA’s Office of De-
fense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) is being expended commen-
surate with the remaining risks posed by poorly secured fissile ma-
terials. Specifically, the committee seeks to understand whether
these ‘‘legacy’’ programs may now be generally addressing lower-
value materials or facilities and working with countries that may
pose less urgent or direct nuclear security and proliferation risks

to the United States. Furthermore, the committee seeks to under-
stand whether current programs are flexible enough to address
new risks as they emerge.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess, for each DNN program identified, includ-
ing those within the DNN offices of Global Material Security and
Material Management and Minimization: (1) The range of activities
implemented by the program and the countries in which the pro-
gram operates or is planning to operate; (2) Outcomes defined by
the program, the national security benefits of those outcomes, and
how the program measures progress toward the outcomes; (3)
Funding levels for the program, including carryover funds; (4) The
scope of work remaining in the program, and the projected timeline
and cost for completion of the work; and (5) The extent to which
current program design is sufficiently flexible to respond to emerg-
ing global risks.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than February 1, 2026, with final results to
follow in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration construction project cost drivers
The committee notes that in recent years, the National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) has experienced significant cost
growth in its portfolio of capital asset acquisitions. The committee
is seeking to understand the drivers of cost across this portfolio,
both in terms of baseline costs as well as cost growth. For example,
the committee has learned of significant differences in the con-
struction cost per square foot of facilities built by NNSA manage-
ment and operating contractors as compared to the private sector
and would like to better understand what drives these differences.
Similarly, the committee has learned of quality assurance problems
on nuclear construction that have contributed to costly rework.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess the factors that contribute to the signifi-
cant costs of construction in the nuclear security enterprise. The
committee further directs the Comptroller General to provide a
one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to
the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon
date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a
mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration’s artificial intelligence and machine
learning strategy
The committee notes that modeling and simulating the com-
plexity of nuclear weapons systems is essential to maintaining con-
fidence in the performance of the stockpile without underground
nuclear explosive testing. The committee notes that artificial intel-
ligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies have the poten-
tial to transform how the nuclear enterprise uses computer models
and simulation to evaluate, design, certify, and qualify the stock-

pile and to dramatically reduce the time to execute stockpile stew-
ardship and modernization. Applying AI/ML in the nuclear enter-
prise also presents unique challenges, given the high-security and
high-consequence environment in which the National Nuclear Se-
curity Administration (NNSA) and nuclear security laboratories op-
erate. These challenges include limited or sparse data sets, tight
constraints on model correctness driven by the high consequence of
error, and the complexity of the computer codes needed to simulate
nuclear weapons.
The committee understands that in 2023, the NNSA’s Advanced
Simulation and Computing program developed an AI/ML strategy,
called AI for Nuclear Deterrence (AI4ND), to develop and deploy
technologies and computing capabilities that can effectively lever-
age AI for stockpile stewardship. The committee seeks to enhance
its understanding of this strategy.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The NNSA’s efforts to address data,
modeling, and other challenges to adopting AI/ML to stockpile
stewardship and modernization; (2) The resources the NNSA has
identified as needed to achieve the goals of the AI4ND strategy;
and (3) The risks and opportunities of collaborating through part-
nerships with industry, academia, and across the Federal Govern-
ment on AI/ML.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than March 31, 2026, with final results to fol-
low in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration’s federal program and project manager
responsibilities
The committee notes that the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration’s (NNSA) effort to modernize the nuclear security enter-
prise will cost billions of dollars over the next two decades and in-
volve multiple complex programs and supporting projects that must
be effectively integrated. For example, the committee notes that
NNSA’s effort to establish a modern pit production capability—one
of the most complex and potentially costly of NNSA’s moderniza-
tion efforts—encompasses a broad range of program activities, six
major capital asset projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and
the Savannah River Site, and other activities. NNSA has struggled
to mitigate the risks of uncontrolled changes to scope, cost, and
schedule and to meet production program and project goals. The
committee is aware that NNSA program and project managers are
concerned that they may lack appropriate authority to direct con-
tractors’ work, control budgetary resources, accept project and pro-
gram risk, and be supported by a sufficient and well-trained federal
team—all key features of effective program and project manage-
ment. The committee notes that recent NNSA personnel reductions
may complicate these efforts.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The NNSA’s federal program and
project manager responsibilities, including their authorities and re-

modernization programs and their associated projects, which were
previously assessed in a July 2024 Government Accountability Of-
fice report, titled ‘‘National Nuclear Security Administration: Ac-
tions Needed to Improve Integration of Production Modernization
Programs and Projects’’ (GAO–24–106342).
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than April 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of National Nuclear Security
Administration’s Office of Cost Estimating and Program
Evaluation
The committee notes that in 2013, the Office of Cost Estimating
and Program Evaluation (CEPE) was established by statute within
the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to provide
unbiased analysis in support of decision-making on projects, pro-
grams, and portfolios. The committee believes that this was a capa-
bility the NNSA lacked. CEPE’s responsibilities have grown over
the years, and the NNSA is undertaking a massive and challenging
nuclear modernization effort. The committee understands that this
moment has been described as the busiest the NNSA has been
since the Cold War. The committee would like to understand
whether CEPE has the capacity to fulfill its responsibilities and
keep pace with modernization efforts.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The extent of CEPE’s various respon-
sibilities and how they have changed over time; and (2) Any chal-
lenges to CEPE’s ability to fulfill its responsibilities, the independ-
ence of its evaluations, or the implementation of the results of its
analyses.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than May 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of Office of Environmental
Management efforts to optimize cleanup activities
The committee notes that the Department of Energy’s Office of
Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for cleaning up
sites and facilities contaminated by decades of nuclear weapons
production and nuclear energy research. The committee under-
stands that EM’s most costly responsibilities involve tank waste
management and the deactivation and decommissioning of excess
facilities. The agency regularly makes choices among options for
cleaning up and disposing of radioactive waste that have different
costs, limitations, and risks.
The committee notes that in a September 2024 report, the U.S.
Government Accountability Office (GAO) developed a hypothetical
optimization model to serve as an example of how EM could poten-

tially optimize nuclear waste disposal decisions, which could in
turn achieve cleanup sooner, decrease costs, and reduce risks
(‘‘Hanford Cleanup: Alternatives for Treating and Disposing of
High-Level Waste Could Save Billions of Dollars and Reduce Cer-
tain Risks’’ (GAO–24–106989)). However, GAO reported in April
2025 that EM is not taking steps to optimize the disposal sequenc-
ing of its nuclear waste (‘‘Priority Open Recommendations: Depart-
ment of Energy’’ (GAO–25–108093)). The committee notes that it is
unclear to what extent EM is optimizing the sequencing of cleanup
activities—including tank waste cleanup activities and deactivation
and decommissioning efforts—within and across its sites.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess opportunities to optimize EM nuclear waste
cleanup and disposal and deactivation and decommissioning efforts.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to coordi-
nate with the congressional defense committees to determine which
waste streams or cleanup efforts to review and to provide a one-
time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assessment to the
congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed upon date,
not later than March 1, 2026, with final results to follow in a mu-
tually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of Office of Environmental
Management’s fraud risk management for contracts and
subcontracts
The committee notes that, as one of the largest contracting agen-
cies in the federal government outside of the Department of De-
fense, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Environmental
Management (EM) relies primarily on contractors to carry out its
diverse missions and operate its laboratories and other facilities,
spending approximately 90 percent of its annual budget on con-
tracts. In fiscal year 2025, $8.0 billion of that annual budget will
be spent on nuclear waste cleanup activities across the country.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the DOE’s
Office of Inspector General have identified multiple contracting
fraud risks and reported on incidents of fraudulent activity by the
DOE’s contractors and subcontractors. The committee notes that
GAO first designated aspects of the DOE’s contract management as
high-risk areas for the Government in 1990 because its record of
inadequate management and oversight of contractors left the DOE
vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. As of 2025,
EM’s acquisition and program management remain on GAO’s High-
Risk List.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess EM’s fraud risk management efforts with
respect to contracts and subcontracts, including assessments of pos-
sible: (1) Conflicts of interest; (2) Bid rigging; (3) Small business
fraud; and (4) Overpayments. The committee further directs the
Comptroller General to provide a one-time preliminary briefing on
the results of its assessment to the congressional defense commit-
tees at a mutually agreed upon date, not later than March 1, 2026,
with final results to follow in a mutually agreed upon format and
timeframe.

Comptroller General review of options for grouting low-ac-
tivity waste at the Hanford Site
The committee notes that the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Of-
fice of Environmental Management’s (EM) most expensive cleanup
project is located at the Hanford Site in Washington State and in-
volves the treatment and immobilization of radioactive and haz-
ardous tank waste. The committee understands that in 2024, EM
announced plans to grout 2,000 gallons of low-activity tank waste
for off-site disposal as a part of EM’s Test Bed Initiative. Addition-
ally, pursuant to a recently finalized holistic agreement among the
Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and
the State of Washington, EM now plans to complete retrieval of 22
tanks in Hanford’s southwest tank farms by 2040. The committee
understands that the low-activity portion of this waste would be
grouted and disposed of off-site. However, DOE has not yet decided
where this waste will be grouted, and some stakeholders have
raised concerns about EM’s plans to transport this waste.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The status of EM’s Test Bed Initiative;
(2) The on-site and off-site options EM has considered for grouting
Hanford’s low-activity waste; and (3) The benefits and drawbacks
of on-site versus off-site treatment prior to disposal.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than March 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Comptroller General review of status of Idaho National Lab-
oratory’s defense nuclear waste treatment
The committee notes that the Department of Energy’s Office of
Environmental Management (EM) began operating the Integrated
Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) at Idaho National Laboratory in
April 2023, after a nearly $1.0 billion cost overrun and 10-year
delay. The facility is designed to treat 772,000 gallons of sodium-
bearing waste, a liquid waste that EM currently manages as high-
level radioactive waste. Idaho National Laboratory also stores ap-
proximately 4,400 cubic meters of dried granular calcine waste,
stored in six stainless steel bin sets, but it does not yet have plans
for how it will treat or dispose of this waste. EM likewise currently
manages the calcine waste at Idaho National Lab as high-level ra-
dioactive waste.
The committee notes that since beginning operations in 2023, the
IWTU has faced ongoing issues, raising questions about the reli-
ability and operability of the facility. For example, the facility was
shut down in September 2023 so that staff could replace media in
its granular activated carbon beds. The media removes mercury
from the gas by-product of the waste treatment process. EM offi-
cials estimated that the facility would restart operations in Janu-
ary 2024. However, when attempting to restart in March 2024,
crews identified abnormal conditions, causing EM to further sus-
pend start-up activities; the facility ultimately restarted in Sep-
tember 2024. The facility again shut down for 2 weeks in January
2025 to address a clogged feed line. In February 2025, Idaho offi-

cials announced that the facility would shut down for an additional
4 months to replace a carbon bed and perform other maintenance.
The committee understands that, in addition, EM has not yet de-
termined how it will dispose of the immobilized waste treated by
the IWTU. EM has considered disposing it as transuranic waste at
the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico but will need to
overcome legal and regulatory barriers before doing so. Moreover,
the waste reportedly may need further treatment with vitrification
if it cannot be disposed of as transuranic waste.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The steps EM is taking to address tech-
nical issues it has encountered and the impacts of the technical
issues on its treatment efforts; (2) The extent to which EM holds
its contractors accountable for continued issues facing the IWTU;
and (3) EM’s plans for treating and disposing of the sodium-bearing
and calcine waste at Idaho National Laboratory.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than March 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.

sites and facilities contaminated by decades of nuclear weapons
production and nuclear energy research. Much of this waste is dis-
posed of at off-site disposal facilities. The committee further notes
that, in recent years, communities along transportation paths have
voiced concerns about radiological materials being transported
through or near these communities, and, in some cases, municipali-
ties have banned such transport.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The steps EM takes to ensure the safe
packaging and transportation of radiological and hazardous mate-
rials; (2) How EM engages with stakeholders and communities
along transportation routes; and (3) The lessons EM can learn from
other entities that package and transport radiological and haz-
ardous materials.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees on the status of its
review at a mutually agreed upon date, not later than March 1,
2026, with final results to follow in a mutually agreed upon format
and timeframe.
Comptroller General review to identify efficiency opportu-
nities in National Nuclear Security Administration cap-
ital asset acquisitions
The committee notes that the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration (NNSA) manages its large capital asset acquisition
projects in accordance with the Department of Energy’s (DOE)
Order 413.3B. This order has evolved over the past decade and a

half to include more rigorous project management requirements
that reflect best practices. Despite these more rigorous expecta-
tions, NNSA’s project performance is declining, and NNSA is in-
creasingly seeking to obtain capital assets through means other
than projects executed under Order 413.3B or is seeking waivers
to the order’s requirements. The committee recognizes that the way
NNSA has elected to implement Order 413.3B requirements may
be onerous, and the committee would like to better understand
what opportunities for improvement exist while still ensuring that
projects are managed consistent with best practices. Further, the
committee is seeking to better understand alternative means of ac-
quiring capital assets.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) The extent to which DOE Order 413.3B
reflects best practices in project management and NNSA’s ap-
proach to implementing the order’s requirements; (2) Any opportu-
nities that may exist to streamline or improve NNSA’s implementa-
tion approach, particularly with respect to improving projects’
schedule performance; and (3) Whether the alternative means
NNSA has pursued to acquiring capital assets have proved bene-
ficial with respect to schedule performance and risk management.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than April 30, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.
Rendija Canyon land study
The committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear Security to
conduct a study of portions of Tract A–14 (Rendija Canyon) that
may be suitable for conveyance for residential use. Suitable land
means subtracts that have been identified by the National Nuclear
Security Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, that meet the requirements for conveyance under the
Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and
Related Agencies Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–119), that require
minimal remediation, and that will meet the requirements for con-
veyance of the Department of Energy Order 458.1, ‘‘Radiation Pro-
tection of the Public and the Environment,’’ and the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91–190). The committee
further directs the Administrator to brief the congressional defense
committees with the results of the study immediately upon its com-
pletion, not later than March 31, 2026.
Report on advances in the nuclear weapons design process
The committee notes that over the past 30 years a number of ad-
vances have been made at the National Nuclear Security Adminis-
tration’s (NNSA) Nevada National Nuclear Security Sites Principal
Underground Laboratory for Subcritical Experimentation (PULSE).
The committee understands that at PULSE, formerly known as the
U1a Complex, scientists conduct subcritical and physics experi-
ments to obtain technical information about the U.S. nuclear weap-
ons stockpile. In particular, PULSE is undergoing a major con-
struction project that will enable it to conduct Enhanced Capabili-

ties for Subcritical Experiments (ECSE), which will host two of the
most capable weapons radiographic systems in the world, the
ZEUS and Scorpius test beds. Both are critical components in ef-
forts to assess pit design as the NNSA begins to produce pits at
scale at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah
River Site. Further, the committee understands that the NNSA is
now incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in weapons design to
integrate the data from over 1,000 above- and below-ground tests
to interpolate and extend design parameters outside the existing
testing envelope and parameter database.
Therefore, the committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear
Security, not later than March 1, 2026, to provide a one-time brief-
ing to the congressional defense committees on:
(1) How the combined initiatives of using AI in weapons de-
sign, pit production, and ECSE could provide greater certainty
on warhead performance as compared to current weapons de-
sign process; and
(2) The estimated costs and length of preparation time re-
quired to conduct a full scale nuclear explosive test should a
determination be made that such a test is required to ensure
the safety, reliability, performance, or military effectiveness of
a weapon in the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.
Report on commercially available counter unmanned aerial
systems
Continued advances in commercially available artificial intel-
ligence, computer vision, and sensor fusion capabilities could help
meet the growing threat that unmanned aerial systems (UAS) pose
to critical infrastructure and secure sites, including Department of
Energy installations. The committee remains supportive of the Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) efforts to leverage
commercially available software and hardware technology to detect
ground and aerial intrusions and advanced defeat capabilities to
combat the UAS threat. Following a review of its security require-
ments, NNSA implemented a pilot program leveraging these com-
mercial technologies to combat the UAS threat.
The committee is encouraged by the Department of Energy’s in-
novative approach, which provides for the rapid deployment of
leading commercial technology to improve security while reducing
overall costs. The committee also supports NNSA’s efforts to transi-
tion its successful pilot to a family of systems program of record
and expand deployment of this technology to additional sites across
the NNSA complex as part of its future years nuclear security pro-
gram.
The committee directs the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security
and Administrator, NNSA, to provide a briefing to the Committees
on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
not later than December 13, 2025, regarding the expansion of this
program and transition to a family of systems program of record,
including associated resource requirements and timelines to deploy
these commercially available capabilities across the national secu-
rity enterprise.

Satellite facility long-term leasing
The committee recognizes that authorizing the National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) to purchase options for future
purchasing or leasing of real property provides benefits to the
NNSA in long-term infrastructure planning. The committee be-
lieves this authority has been particularly helpful in cost-effectively
expediting the expansion and modernization of the Kansas City
National Security Campus to meet increasing production demands
for the nuclear security enterprise (NSE). The committee under-
stands that expanded use of such authorities could benefit other lo-
cations within the NSE that require significant infrastructure up-
grades, particularly in such cases where selected supporting facili-
ties could be relocated outside protected areas to reduce cost and
unnecessary administrative burdens. Such evolutions in long-term
installation capability planning will be key to efficiently and cost
effectively managing the operation of NNSA-supporting facilities
over the coming decades, and the committee strongly recommends
that the NNSA maximize the use of this authority in the develop-
ment of site strategies across the NSE.
Therefore, the committee directs the Administrator for Nuclear
Security, in consultation with the Directors of Los Alamos, Law-
rence Livermore, and Sandia National Laboratories and the Site
Managers of the Y–12 National Security Complex, the Savannah
River Site, the Pantex Plant, the Nevada National Security Site,
and the Kansas City National Security Campus, to provide a one-
time briefing to the congressional defense committees, not later
than May 1, 2026, on site strategies across the NSE. The briefing
should include the identification of opportunities for expanding the
use of the authorities provided by Section 3265 of the National Nu-
clear Security Administration Act (section 2466 of title 50, United
States Code) and any recommendations for additional authorities
that might aid the NNSA in making greater use of satellite facili-
ties in areas neighboring laboratory and site installations.
Unexploded ordnance from legacy tests near Sandia Na-
tional Laboratories
The committee notes that Cold War-era nuclear weapons tests
have left unexploded ordnance (UXO) across the United States. Al-
though measures have been taken to remediate UXO, the com-
mittee remains concerned that additional remediation efforts may
be needed in lands near the National Nuclear Security Administra-
tion’s (NNSA) Sandia National Laboratories and the adjoining
Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the
United States to assess: (1) What UXO remediation efforts NNSA
has completed in the vicinity of Sandia National Laboratories; and
(2) The extent to which additional efforts are needed to ensure that
all affected nearby communities have been cleared of legacy UXO.
The committee further directs the Comptroller General to pro-
vide a one-time, preliminary briefing on the results of its assess-
ment to the congressional defense committees at a mutually agreed
upon date, not later than April 1, 2026, with final results to follow
in a mutually agreed upon format and timeframe.

The committee recommends a provision that would provide for
the allocation of funds among programs, projects, and activities in
accordance with the tables in division D of this Act, subject to re-
programming in accordance with established procedures.
Consistent with the previously expressed views of the committee,
the provision would also require that decisions by an agency head
to commit, obligate, or expend funds to a specific entity on the
basis of such funding tables be based on authorized, transparent,
and statutory criteria or merit-based selection procedures in ac-
cordance with the requirements of sections 2304(k) and 2374 of
title 10, United States Code, and other applicable provisions of law.

Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate
It was not possible to include the Congressional Budget Office
cost estimate on this legislation because it was not available at the
time the report was filed. It will be included in material presented
during the Senate floor debate on the legislation.
Regulatory Impact
Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate requires that a report on the regulatory impact of the bill be
included in the report on the bill. The committee finds that there
is no regulatory impact in the case of the National Defense Author-
ization Bill for Fiscal Year 2026.
Changes in Existing Law
Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the
Standing Rules of the Senate, the changes in existing law made by
certain portions of the bill have not been shown in this section of
the report because, in the opinion of the committee, it is necessary
to dispense with showing such changes in order to expedite the
business of the Senate and reduce the expenditure of funds.
