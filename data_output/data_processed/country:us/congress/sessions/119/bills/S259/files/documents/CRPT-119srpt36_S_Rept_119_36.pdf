FOREIGN ADVERSARY COMMUNICATIONS
TRANSPARENCY ACT
JULY9, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 259]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 259) to direct the Federal Commu-
nications Commission to publish a list of entities that hold author-
izations, licenses, or other grants of authority issued by the Com-
mission and that have certain foreign ownership, and for other pur-
poses, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with-
out amendment and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 259, Foreign Adversary Communications
Transparency Act, is to require the Federal Communications Com-
mission (FCC) to publish a list of entities that hold authorizations,
licenses, and other grants of authority issued by the FCC that have
certain foreign ownership.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Congress and the Federal Government have taken significant
steps to reduce the presence of malign Chinese actors in American
communications networks. Perhaps most visibly, Congress passed
the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019,
which established the FCC’s Covered List and required the FCC to
publish a list of companies that provide equipment and services

that could compromise U.S. national security.1 Additionally, the Se-
cure Equipment Act of 2021 prohibited the FCC from reviewing or
approving any new equipment authorizations from companies on
the FCC’s Covered List.2 Separately, in 2021 and 2022, the FCC
revoked the section 214 operating authorities of China Telecom
Americas, China Unicom Americas, Pacific Networks, and ComNet
USA.3
Under current law, entities holding licenses or authorizations
granted by the FCC must receive prior approval before transferring
or assigning any ownership stake.4 And unless approved by the
FCC, broadcast, common carrier, and aeronautical station, license
holders are subject to a 25 percent foreign ownership stake cap.5
Despite existing prohibitions on authorizations of equipment sub-
ject to the Covered List and restrictions on transfer of FCC licenses
or permits, entities with ties to adversarial foreign governments
can still hold FCC licenses or authorizations.6
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 259 would require the FCC to do the following:
• Identify and publish on its website a list of entities with ties
to covered countries that hold licenses or authorizations grant-
ed by the FCC.
• Issue rules requiring the collection of information on such li-
censees’ ownership structure.
• Annually update the public list of entities.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 259 was introduced on January 27, 2025, by Senator Fischer
(for herself and Senators Rosen, Cornyn, and Luja´n) and was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
of the Senate. On April 30, 2025, the Committee met in open Exec-
utive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 259 reported favorably
without amendment.
H.R. 906, a House companion bill to S. 259, was introduced on
January 31, 2025, by Representative Wittman (for himself and
Representatives Kean, Khanna, and Castor) and was referred to
the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Rep-
resentatives. Representative Stefanik is an additional cosponsor.
On April 8, 2025, that Committee met in open Executive Session
and, by voice vote, ordered H.R. 906 reported favorably. H.R. 906
was considered under suspension of the rules on April 28, 2025,
and passed by voice vote in the House.

tation of the Senate.

resentatives Gallagher and Khanna) and was referred to the Com-

117th Congress
H.R. 9236, the Foreign Adversary Communications Transparency

ferred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
Representatives.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 259 would require the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to publish annually a list of entities with ties to China, Iran,
North Korea, or Russia that hold licenses or authorizations granted
by the commission.
Based on information from the FCC, CBO expects that the agen-
cy would need five employees, at an annual average cost of
$225,000 per employee, for the first two years, to review existing

grants of authority, and two employees after 2027 to review new
applications and changes in ownership. On that basis, CBO esti-
mates that it would cost the FCC $4 million over the 2025–2030
period to issue rules and identify whether any of those four nations
hold equity or a voting interest in organizations that have an au-
thorization, license, or other grant of authority issued by the com-
mission. Because the FCC is authorized to collect fees each year
sufficient to offset the appropriated costs of its regulatory activities,
CBO estimates that the net cost to the FCC would be negligible,
assuming appropriation actions consistent with that authority.
If the FCC increases annual fee collections to offset the costs of
implementing provisions in the bill, S. 259 would increase the cost
of an existing private-sector mandate on entities required to pay
those fees. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate
would be small and would fall below the threshold established in
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for private-sector
mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Margot Berman (for
federal costs) and Rachel Austin (for mandates). The estimate was
reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 259 would direct the FCC to issue rules facilitating the collec-
tion of information on certain current licensees’ ownership struc-
tures to create a list of entities that hold authorizations, licenses,
and other grants of authority issued by the FCC that have certain
foreign ownership. The collection would require licensees to provide
information on their ownership structure to identify if a covered
entity holds an equity or voting interest, and therefore, would be
added to the list.
Economic Impact
S. 259 is not expected to have an adverse impact on the Nation’s
economy. The legislation would publish a list of entities that hold
authorizations, licenses, and other grants of authority issued by the
FCC that have certain foreign ownership.
Privacy
S. 259 would not impact the personal privacy of individuals.
Paperwork
The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paper-
work burdens for private individuals or businesses resulting from
the passage of this legislation. Licensees would be required to re-

5
port on their ownership structure, and those with certain owner-
ship would be publicly disclosed.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘For-
eign Adversary Communications Transparency Act’’.
Section 2. List of entities holding FCC authorizations, licenses, or
other grants of authority and having certain foreign ownership.
This section would define the terms ‘‘appropriate national secu-
rity agency’’, ‘‘Commission’’, ‘‘covered country’’, and ‘‘covered enti-
ty’’.
This section would require the FCC to publish on its website a
list of entities that hold a license or authorization and in which a
covered entity either (i) holds a specified voting or equity interest
or (ii) has been determined by a national security agency to be sub-
ject to the control of a covered entity, no later than 120 days after
enactment.
This section would also direct the FCC to issue rules facilitating
the collection of information on the ownership structure of licensees
on the FCC’s published list no later than 18 months after enact-
ment. No later than 1 year after the FCC issues these rules, the
FCC would be required to add to the published list any such entity
in which a covered entity holds a specified voting or equity interest.
The collection of information to create this list would be exempt
from the Paperwork Reduction Act. The FCC would be required to
update the published list annually.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
