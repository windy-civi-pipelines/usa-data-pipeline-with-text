PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3383, the Increasing Investor Opportunities Act, was intro-
duced on May 14, 2025, by Representative Ann Wagner (MO–02).
H.R. 3383 amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 by direct-
ing the SEC to allow publicly offered closed end funds to invest all
their assets in private securities, thereby increasing retail investor
exposure to private markets while maintaining investor protection.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Approximately 3.6 million retail investors rely on closed-end
funds (CEFs) as an important source of retirement savings and in-
vestment opportunities. These funds are strictly regulated and pro-
fessionally managed investment vehicles that are treated as sophis-
ticated investors and can invest freely in privately offered invest-
ments that retail investors typically cannot access. These funds
regularly invest in privately offered assets that may be illiquid,
such as repurchase agreements, derivatives, certain municipal se-
curities, and institutional debt. The funds can also invest in private
funds. However, the SEC currently limits those investments to 15
percent of the fund’s net assets, unless the fund only offers its
shares to accredited investors with minimum initial purchases of at
least $25,000. H.R. 3383 directs the SEC to allow publicly offered
CEFs to invest all their assets in private securities, thereby in-
creasing retail investor exposure to private markets while main-
taining investor protection.

COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote

ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes

yeas and 10 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–
109).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
3383:
• Representative Wagner offered an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute, which made minor edits and technical
changes. This amendment was adopted by a voice vote.
• Representative Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an amend-
ment (No. 1), designated AMEND_HR3383_1. This amendment
prevents any issuer from providing more retail oriented, non-
QIB accredited investors with more favorable terms, putting
them at a disadvantage. The amendment also requires invest-
ment advisers for pooled investment companies to adhere to
Rule 2a–5 valuation policies unless the fund is exclusively open
to QIBs, which moves private funds closer to registered invest-
ment company requirements. This amendment failed by a re-
corded vote of 23 yeas and 28 nays, a quorum being present.
(Record Vote No. FC–108).

PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House

COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3383. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.

With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House

visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.

The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the

ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Section 7:
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION

Section 8:
Section 1. Short title

Section 9:
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘Increasing Investor Op-
portunities Act.’’

Section 10:
Section 2. Closed-end company authority to invest in private funds

Section 11:
Section 2 amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to provide
a closed-end company the authority to invest in private funds with-
out limitation. Specifically, this section states that the SEC may
not limit a closed-end company from investing any or all of the
company’s assets in private funds solely or primarily because of the
private fund’s status as a private fund. This section also applies to
a closed-end company that elects to be treated as a business devel-
opment company. This section also clarifies that the rules of a na-
tional securities exchange do not prohibit the listing or trading of
securities of a closed-end company solely or primarily because of
the amount of the company’s investment in private funds.

gaged in a business or businesses other than that of investing,
reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities either di-

nesses. The filing of an application under this paragraph in

SEC. 6. (a) An exchange may be registered as a national securi-
ties exchange under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided
in this section and in accordance with the provisions of section
19(a) of this title, by filing with the Commission an application for
registration in such form as the Commission, by rule, may pre-
scribe containing the rules of the exchange and such other informa-
tion and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors.
(b) An exchange shall not be registered as a national securities
exchange unless the Commission determines that—
(1) Such exchange is so organized and has the capacity to be
able to carry out the purposes of this title and to comply, and
(subject to any rule or order of the Commission pursuant to

Section 18:
section 17(d) or 19(g)(2) of this title) to enforce compliance by
its members and persons associated with its members, with the
provisions of this title, the rules and regulations thereunder,
and the rules of the exchange.
(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section,
the rules of the exchange provide that any registered broker or
dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or
dealer may become a member of such exchange and any person
may become associated with a member thereof.
(3) The rules of the exchange assure a fair representation of
its members in the selection of its directors and administration
of its affairs and provide that one or more directors shall be
representative of issuers and investors and not be associated
with a member of the exchange, broker, or dealer.
(4) The rules of the exchange provide for the equitable alloca-
tion of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its
members and issuers and other persons using its facilities.
(5) The rules of the exchange are designed to prevent fraudu-
lent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordi-
nation with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating trans-
actions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public in-
terest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination be-
tween customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, or to regulate by
virtue of any authority conferred by this title matters not re-
lated to the purposes of this title or the administration of the
exchange.
(6) The rules of the exchange provide that (subject to any
rule or order of the Commission pursuant to section 17(d) or
19(g)(2) of this title) its members and persons associated with
its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of
the provisions of this title, the rules or regulations thereunder,
or the rules of the exchange, by expulsion, suspension, limita-
tion of activities, functions, and operations, fine, censure, being
suspended or barred from being associated with a member, or
any other fitting sanction.

(7) The rules of the exchange are in accordance with the pro-
visions of subsection (d) of this section, and in general, provide
a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons
associated with members, the denial of membership to any per-
son seeking membership therein, the barring of any person
from becoming associated with a member thereof, and the pro-
hibition or limitation by the exchange of any person with re-
spect to access to services offered by the exchange or a member
thereof.
(8) The rules of the exchange do not impose any burden on
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of this title.
(9)(A) The rules of the exchange prohibit the listing of any
security issued in a limited partnership rollup transaction (as
such term is defined in paragraphs (4) and (5) of section 14(h)),
unless such transaction was conducted in accordance with pro-
cedures designed to protect the rights of limited partners, in-
cluding—
(i) the right of dissenting limited partners to one of the
following:
(I) an appraisal and compensation;
(II) retention of a security under substantially the
same terms and conditions as the original issue;
(III) approval of the limited partnership rollup
transaction by not less than 75 percent of the out-
standing securities of each of the participating limited
partnerships;
(IV) the use of a committee of limited partners that
is independent, as determined in accordance with
rules prescribed by the exchange, of the general part-
ner or sponsor, that has been approved by a majority
of the outstanding units of each of the participating
limited partnerships, and that has such authority as is
necessary to protect the interest of limited partners,
including the authority to hire independent advisors,
to negotiate with the general partner or sponsor on be-
half of the limited partners, and to make a rec-
ommendation to the limited partners with respect to
the proposed transaction; or
(V) other comparable rights that are prescribed by
rule by the exchange and that are designed to protect
dissenting limited partners;
(ii) the right not to have their voting power unfairly re-
duced or abridged;
(iii) the right not to bear an unfair portion of the costs
of a proposed limited partnership rollup transaction that is
rejected; and
(iv) restrictions on the conversion of contingent interests
or fees into non-contingent interests or fees and restric-
tions on the receipt of a non-contingent equity interest in
exchange for fees for services which have not yet been pro-
vided.

partner’’ means a person who, on the date on which soliciting
material is mailed to investors, is a holder of a beneficial inter-

est in a limited partnership that is the subject of a limited
partnership rollup transaction, and who casts a vote against
the transaction and complies with procedures established by
the exchange, except that for purposes of an exchange or ten-
der offer, such person shall file an objection in writing under
the rules of the exchange during the period during which the
offer is outstanding.
(10)(A) The rules of the exchange prohibit any member that
is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under sec-
tion 12 from granting a proxy to vote the security in connection
with a shareholder vote described in subparagraph (B), unless
the beneficial owner of the security has instructed the member
to vote the proxy in accordance with the voting instructions of
the beneficial owner.
(B) A shareholder vote described in this subparagraph is a
shareholder vote with respect to the election of a member of
the board of directors of an issuer, executive compensation, or
any other significant matter, as determined by the Commis-
sion, by rule, and does not include a vote with respect to the
uncontested election of a member of the board of directors of
any investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b–1 et seq.).
(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit
a national securities exchange from prohibiting a member that
is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under sec-
tion 12 from granting a proxy to vote the security in connection
with a shareholder vote not described in subparagraph (A).
(c)(1) A national securities exchange shall deny membership to
(A) any person, other than a natural person, which is not a reg-
istered broker or dealer or (B) any natural person who is not, or
is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer.
(2) A national securities exchange may, and in cases in which the
Commission, by order, directs as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors shall, deny mem-
bership to any registered broker or dealer or natural person associ-
ated with a registered broker or dealer, and bar from becoming as-
sociated with a member any person, who is subject to a statutory
disqualification. A national securities exchange shall file notice
with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting
any person to membership or permitting any person to become as-
sociated with a member, if the exchange knew, or in the exercise
of reasonable care should have known, that such person was sub-
ject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such form
and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may pre-
scribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors.
(3)(A) A national securities exchange may deny membership to,
or condition the membership of, a registered broker or dealer if (i)
such broker or dealer does not meet such standards of financial re-
sponsibility or operational capability or such broker or dealer or
any natural person associated with such broker or dealer does not
meet such standards of training, experience, and competence as are
prescribed by the rules of the exchange or (ii) such broker or dealer
or person associated with such broker or dealer has engaged and
there is a reasonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or

practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A
national securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifica-
tions of an applicant to become a member and the natural persons
associated with such an applicant in accordance with procedures
established by the rules of the exchange.
(B) A national securities exchange may bar a natural person
from becoming a member or associated with a member, or condition
the membership of a natural person or association of a natural per-
son with a member, if such natural person (i) does not meet such
standards of training, experience, and competence as are prescribed
by the rules of the exchange or (ii) has engaged and there is a rea-
sonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or practices incon-
sistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A national secu-
rities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an ap-
plicant to become a person associated with a member in accordance
with procedures established by the rules of the exchange and re-
quire any person associated with a member, or any class of such
persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with pro-
cedures so established.
(C) A national securities exchange may bar any person from be-
coming associated with a member if such person does not agree (i)
to supply the exchange with such information with respect to its
relationship and dealings with the member as may be specified in
the rules of the exchange and (ii) to permit the examination of its
books and records to verify the accuracy of any information so sup-
plied.
(4) A national securities exchange may limit (A) the number of
members of the exchange and (B) the number of members and des-
ignated representatives of members permitted to effect transactions
on the floor of the exchange without the services of another person
acting as broker: Provided, however, That no national securities ex-
change shall have the authority to decrease the number of member-
ships in such exchange, or the number of members and designated
representatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of such exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, below such number in effect on May 1, 1975, or the date
such exchange was registered with the Commission, whichever is
later: And provided further, That the Commission, in accordance
with the provisions of section 19(c) of this title, may amend the
rules of any national securities exchange to increase (but not to de-
crease) or to remove any limitation on the number of memberships
in such exchange or the number of members or designated rep-
resentatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of the exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, if the Commission finds that such limitation imposes a
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of this title.
(d)(1) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to de-
termine whether a member or person associated with a member
should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursuant
to paragraph (3) of this subsection), the exchange shall bring spe-
cific charges, notify such member or person of, and give him an op-
portunity to defend against, such charges, and keep a record. A de-
termination by the exchange to impose a disciplinary sanction shall
be supported by a statement setting forth—

(A) any act or practice in which such member or person asso-
ciated with a member has been found to have engaged, or
which such member or person has been found to have omitted;
(B) the specific provision of this title, the rules or regulations
thereunder, or the rules of the exchange which any such act or
practice, or omission to act, is deemed to violate; and
(C) the sanction imposed and the reasons therefor.
(2) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to deter-
mine whether a person shall be denied membership, barred from
becoming associated with a member, or prohibited or limited with
respect to access to services offered by the exchange or a member
thereof (other than a summary proceeding pursuant to paragraph
(3) of this subsection), the exchange shall notify such person of, and
give him an opportunity to be heard upon, the specific grounds for
denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation under consideration and
keep a record. A determination by the exchange to deny member-
ship, bar a person from becoming associated with a member, or
prohibit or limit a person with respect to access to services offered
by the exchange or a member thereof shall be supported by a state-
ment setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial, bar, or
prohibition or limitation is based.
(3) A national securities exchange may summarily (A) suspend a
member or person associated with a member who has been and is
expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization or
barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any
self-regulatory organization, (B) suspend a member who is in such
financial or operating difficulty that the exchange determines and
so notifies the Commission that the member cannot be permitted
to continue to do business as a member with safety to investors,
creditors, other members, or the exchange, or (C) limit or prohibit
any person with respect to access to services offered by the ex-
change if subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph is applicable
to such person or, in the case of a person who is not a member,
if the exchange determines that such person does not meet the
qualification requirements or other prerequisites for such access
and such person cannot be permitted to continue to have such ac-
cess with safety to investors, creditors, members, or the exchange.
Any person aggrieved by any such summary action shall be
promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the exchange in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this sub-

Section 19:
section. The Commission, by order, may stay any such summary
action on its own motion or upon application by any person ag-
grieved thereby, if the Commission determines summarily or after
notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist sole-
ly of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments)
that such stay is consistent with the public interest and the protec-
tion of investors.
(e)(1) On and after the date of enactment of the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1975, no national securities exchange may impose
any schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or
other fees to be charged by its members: Provided, however, That
until May 1, 1976, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall
not prohibit any such exchange from imposing or fixing any sched-
ule of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be
charged by its members for acting as broker on the floor of the ex-

change or as odd-lot dealer: And provided further, That the Com-
mission, in accordance with the provisions of section 19(b) of this
title as modified by the provisions of paragraph (3) of this sub-

Section 20:
section, may—
(A) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose
a reasonable schedule or fix reasonable rates of commissions,
allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its mem-
bers for effecting transactions on such exchange prior to No-
vember 1, 1976, if the Commission finds that such schedule or
fixed rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees
are in the public interest; and
(B) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose
a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts,
or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting trans-
actions on such exchange after November 1, 1976, if the Com-
mission finds that such schedule or fixed rates of commissions,
allowances, discounts, or other fees (i) are reasonable in rela-
tion to the costs of providing the service for which such fees
are charged (and the Commission publishes the standards em-
ployed in adjudging reasonableness) and (ii) do not impose any
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in further-
ance of the purposes of this title, taking into consideration the
competitive effects of permitting such schedule or fixed rates
weighed against the competitive effects of other lawful actions
which the Commission is authorized to take under this title.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19(c) of this title,
the Commission, by rule, may abrogate any exchange rule which
imposes a schedule or fixes rates of commissions, allowances, dis-
counts, or other fees, if the Commission determines that such
schedule or fixed rates are no longer reasonable, in the public in-
terest, or necessary to accomplish the purposes of this title.
(3)(A) Before approving or disapproving any proposed rule change
submitted by a national securities exchange which would impose a
schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other
fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such
exchange, the Commission shall afford interested persons (i) an op-
portunity for oral presentation of data, views, and arguments and
(ii) with respect to any such rule concerning transactions effected
after November 1, 1976, if the Commission determines there are
disputed issues of material fact, to present such rebuttal submis-
sions and to conduct (or have conducted under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph) such cross-examination as the Commission deter-
mines to be appropriate and required for full disclosure and proper
resolution of such disputed issues of material fact.
(B) The Commission shall prescribe rules and make rulings con-
cerning any proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph designed to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Such rules
or rulings may (i) impose reasonable time limits on each interested
person’s oral presentations, and (ii) require any cross-examination
to which a person may be entitled under subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph to be conducted by the Commission on behalf of that
person in such manner as the Commission determines to be appro-
priate and required for full disclosure and proper resolution of dis-
puted issues of material fact.

(C)(i) If any class of persons, the members of which are entitled
to conduct (or have conducted) cross-examination under subpara-
graphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph and which have, in the view
of the Commission, the same or similar interests in the proceeding,
cannot agree upon a single representative of such interests for pur-
poses of cross-examination, the Commission may make rules and
rulings specifying the manner in which such interests shall be rep-
resented and such cross-examination conducted.
(ii) No member of any class of persons with respect to which the
Commission has specified the manner in which its interests shall
be represented pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be
denied, pursuant to such clause (i), the opportunity to conduct (or
have conducted) cross-examination as to issues affecting his par-
ticular interests if he satisfies the Commission that he has made
a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement upon group
representation and there are substantial and relevant issues which
would not be presented adequately by group representation.
(D) A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation and cross-
examination.
(E) In addition to the bases specified in subsection 25(a), a re-
viewing Court may set aside an order of the Commission under sec-
tion 19(b) approving an exchange rule imposing a schedule or fixing
rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees, if the
Court finds—
(1) a Commission determination under subparagraph (A) of
this paragraph that an interested person is not entitled to con-
duct cross-examination or make rebuttal submissions, or
(2) a Commission rule or ruling under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph limiting the petitioner’s cross-examination or
rebuttal submissions,
has precluded full disclosure and proper resolution
of disputed issues of material fact which were nec-
essary for fair determination by the Commission.
(f) The Commission, by rule or order, as it deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of inves-
tors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or to assure equal regu-
lation, may require—
(1) any person not a member or a designated representative
of a member of a national securities exchange effecting trans-
actions on such exchange without the services of another per-
son acting as a broker, or
(2) any broker or dealer not a member of a national securi-
ties exchange effecting transactions on such exchange on a reg-
ular basis,
to comply with such rules of such exchange as the Commission may
specify.
(g) NOTICE REGISTRATION OF SECURITY FUTURES PRODUCT EX-
CHANGES.—
(1) REGISTRATION REQUIRED.—An exchange that lists or
trades security futures products may register as a national se-
curities exchange solely for the purposes of trading security fu-
tures products if—

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would amend the Investment Act of 1940 to allow a
closed-end fund to invest up to all its assets in private funds, which
would effectively create a private equity-type fund sold directly to
retail investors. A closed-end fund is a type of mutual fund that
issues a fixed number of shares through a single initial public of-
fering (IPO) to raise capital for its initial investments. Its shares
can then be bought and sold on a stock exchange by ordinary retail
investors, but no new shares will be created and no new money will
flow into the fund. In contrast, an open-ended fund, such as most
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), accepts a con-
stant flow of new investment capital and issues new shares over
time. Private funds—consisting primarily of private equity and
venture capital—invest their capital in private businesses, which
issue securities that are not registered with the SEC.
This bill poses risks to retail investors by exposing them to high-
risk private funds that lack important investor protections and reg-
ulatory guardrails and are not required to disclose critical informa-
tion. The assets that private funds invest in—fledgling startups or
distressed companies in need of a turnaround—are significantly
more risky than public securities, and most of their investments
fail (9 out of 10).1 Permitting a closed-end fund to invest up to all
of its money in private funds—with no particular safeguards pro-
vided by the securities laws for retail investors, such as liquidity
requirements and redemptions rights, will enable these funds to
gain easy access to retail investor money, while at the same time
subjecting retail investors to the higher risks of losses (not to men-
tion the general lack of disclosure) inherent in the average private
fund portfolio company. According to analysis by the Consumer
Federation of America:
‘‘[t]his bill would allow closed-end funds to invest 100%
of their net assets in private funds and still be sold to non-
accredited investors, which would effectively create a pri-
vate fund for retail investors without these investors having
to meet the accredited investor definition. This would in-
crease the amount of risky, illiquid, and opaque private
funds that are sold to retail investors, who may not be able
to appreciate the risks or sustain the risk of loss of these
investments. It would also allow for the layering of mul-

about 90% of startups completely fail, Startup Genome research demonstrates that only 1.5%
of startups—or about 15% of those that survive—produce a successful exit of $50 million or more
across the top eight U.S. startup ecosystems.’’).

tiple levels of fund fees, which could make such investments
exorbitantly expensive.’’2
Similarly, Public Citizen, in response to the May 24, 2023, House
Financial Services Committee markup, in a letter to Chairman
McHenry and Ranking Member Waters opposing the bill, wrote, in
part:
‘‘This misleadingly titled bill would expose investors to
greater risk by increasing the limit that a closed-end fund
can invest in a private fund, which are subject to less regu-
lation and disclosure. Currently, the SEC caps the amount
that closed-end funds can invest in private funds at 15% of
net assets, if the closed-end fund is sold to non-accredited
investors, who are investors with lower income and total
wealth. If a closed-end fund has more than 15% of net as-
sets in private funds, it must sell that fund only to accred-
ited investors. This bill would allow closed-end funds to in-
vest 100% of their net assets in private funds and still be
sold to non-accredited investors. Many private funds are
simply bad products that sophisticated investors have
avoided. This bill would allow them to be sloughed off on
those with less investment experience and less income and
savings to lose.’’3
The following groups are opposed to this bill: Public Citizen; Con-
sumer Federation of America; Center for American Progress; Amer-
icans for Financial Reform; North American Securities Administra-
tors Association (NASAA).
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 3383.

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3383, the Increasing Investor Opportunities Act, was intro-
duced on May 14, 2025, by Representative Ann Wagner (MO–02).
H.R. 3383 amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 by direct-
ing the SEC to allow publicly offered closed end funds to invest all
their assets in private securities, thereby increasing retail investor
exposure to private markets while maintaining investor protection.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Approximately 3.6 million retail investors rely on closed-end
funds (CEFs) as an important source of retirement savings and in-
vestment opportunities. These funds are strictly regulated and pro-
fessionally managed investment vehicles that are treated as sophis-
ticated investors and can invest freely in privately offered invest-
ments that retail investors typically cannot access. These funds
regularly invest in privately offered assets that may be illiquid,
such as repurchase agreements, derivatives, certain municipal se-
curities, and institutional debt. The funds can also invest in private
funds. However, the SEC currently limits those investments to 15
percent of the fund’s net assets, unless the fund only offers its
shares to accredited investors with minimum initial purchases of at
least $25,000. H.R. 3383 directs the SEC to allow publicly offered
CEFs to invest all their assets in private securities, thereby in-
creasing retail investor exposure to private markets while main-
taining investor protection.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION

Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee Report to include for each record vote
on a motion to report the measure or matter and on any amend-
ments offered to the measure or matter the total number of votes
for and against and the names of the Members voting for and

yeas and 10 nays, a quorum being present. (Record Vote No. FC–
109).
The Committee considered the following amendments to H.R.
3383:
• Representative Wagner offered an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute, which made minor edits and technical
changes. This amendment was adopted by a voice vote.
• Representative Maxine Waters (D–CA) offered an amend-
ment (No. 1), designated AMEND_HR3383_1. This amendment
prevents any issuer from providing more retail oriented, non-
QIB accredited investors with more favorable terms, putting
them at a disadvantage. The amendment also requires invest-
ment advisers for pooled investment companies to adhere to
Rule 2a–5 valuation policies unless the fund is exclusively open
to QIBs, which moves private funds closer to registered invest-
ment company requirements. This amendment failed by a re-
corded vote of 23 yeas and 28 nays, a quorum being present.
(Record Vote No. FC–108).

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3383 is to direct the SEC to
allow publicly offered closed end funds to invest all their assets in
private securities, thereby increasing retail investor exposure to
private markets while maintaining investor protection.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3383. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
the Committee will adopt as its own the cost estimate by the Direc-
tor of the Congressional Budget Office once it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 provides the short title is the ‘‘Increasing Investor Op-
portunities Act.’’
Section 2. Closed-end company authority to invest in private funds
Section 2 amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to provide
a closed-end company the authority to invest in private funds with-
out limitation. Specifically, this section states that the SEC may
not limit a closed-end company from investing any or all of the
company’s assets in private funds solely or primarily because of the
private fund’s status as a private fund. This section also applies to
a closed-end company that elects to be treated as a business devel-
opment company. This section also clarifies that the rules of a na-
tional securities exchange do not prohibit the listing or trading of
securities of a closed-end company solely or primarily because of
the amount of the company’s investment in private funds.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED
In compliance with clause 3(e) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill,
as reported, are shown as follows (existing law proposed to be omit-
ted is enclosed in black brackets, new matter is printed in italics,

pany’s gross income during its last fiscal year was derived) to-
gether with an additional business or businesses other than in-
vesting, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities.
(7)(A) Any issuer, the outstanding securities of which are
owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of
such securities, are qualified purchasers, and which is not

fering of such securities. Securities that are owned by persons

vestment company to any such issuer.
(E) For purposes of determining compliance with this para-
graph and paragraph (1), an issuer that is otherwise excepted
under this paragraph and an issuer that is otherwise excepted
under paragraph (1) shall not be treated by the Commission as
being a single issuer for purposes of determining whether the
outstanding securities of the issuer excepted under paragraph
(1) are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons or
whether the outstanding securities of the issuer excepted
under this paragraph are owned by persons that are not quali-
fied purchasers. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be con-
strued to establish that a person is a bona fide qualified pur-
chaser for purposes of this paragraph or a bona fide beneficial
owner for purposes of paragraph (1).
(9) Any person substantially all of whose business consists of
owning or holding oil, gas, or other mineral royalties or leases,

ticipation in or investment contracts relative to such royalties,

of investors.
(b) An exchange shall not be registered as a national securities
exchange unless the Commission determines that—

(4) The rules of the exchange provide for the equitable alloca-
tion of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its

lent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordi-
nation with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating trans-
actions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public in-
terest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination be-
tween customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, or to regulate by

lated to the purposes of this title or the administration of the
exchange.

(7) The rules of the exchange are in accordance with the pro-
visions of subsection (d) of this section, and in general, provide

hibition or limitation by the exchange of any person with re-

(9)(A) The rules of the exchange prohibit the listing of any
security issued in a limited partnership rollup transaction (as
such term is defined in paragraphs (4) and (5) of section 14(h)),
unless such transaction was conducted in accordance with pro-
cedures designed to protect the rights of limited partners, in-
cluding—

following:
(I) an appraisal and compensation;

half of the limited partners, and to make a rec-
ommendation to the limited partners with respect to
the proposed transaction; or

est in a limited partnership that is the subject of a limited
partnership rollup transaction, and who casts a vote against
the transaction and complies with procedures established by
the exchange, except that for purposes of an exchange or ten-
der offer, such person shall file an objection in writing under
the rules of the exchange during the period during which the
offer is outstanding.
(10)(A) The rules of the exchange prohibit any member that
is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under sec-
tion 12 from granting a proxy to vote the security in connection
with a shareholder vote described in subparagraph (B), unless
the beneficial owner of the security has instructed the member
to vote the proxy in accordance with the voting instructions of
the beneficial owner.
(B) A shareholder vote described in this subparagraph is a
shareholder vote with respect to the election of a member of
the board of directors of an issuer, executive compensation, or
any other significant matter, as determined by the Commis-
sion, by rule, and does not include a vote with respect to the
uncontested election of a member of the board of directors of
any investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b–1 et seq.).
(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit
a national securities exchange from prohibiting a member that
is not the beneficial owner of a security registered under sec-
tion 12 from granting a proxy to vote the security in connection
with a shareholder vote not described in subparagraph (A).
(c)(1) A national securities exchange shall deny membership to
(A) any person, other than a natural person, which is not a reg-
istered broker or dealer or (B) any natural person who is not, or
is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer.
(2) A national securities exchange may, and in cases in which the
Commission, by order, directs as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors shall, deny mem-
bership to any registered broker or dealer or natural person associ-
ated with a registered broker or dealer, and bar from becoming as-
sociated with a member any person, who is subject to a statutory
disqualification. A national securities exchange shall file notice
with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting
any person to membership or permitting any person to become as-
sociated with a member, if the exchange knew, or in the exercise
of reasonable care should have known, that such person was sub-
ject to a statutory disqualification. The notice shall be in such form
and contain such information as the Commission, by rule, may pre-
scribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors.
(3)(A) A national securities exchange may deny membership to,
or condition the membership of, a registered broker or dealer if (i)
such broker or dealer does not meet such standards of financial re-
sponsibility or operational capability or such broker or dealer or
any natural person associated with such broker or dealer does not
meet such standards of training, experience, and competence as are
prescribed by the rules of the exchange or (ii) such broker or dealer
or person associated with such broker or dealer has engaged and

practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A
national securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifica-
tions of an applicant to become a member and the natural persons
associated with such an applicant in accordance with procedures
established by the rules of the exchange.
(B) A national securities exchange may bar a natural person
from becoming a member or associated with a member, or condition
the membership of a natural person or association of a natural per-
son with a member, if such natural person (i) does not meet such
standards of training, experience, and competence as are prescribed
by the rules of the exchange or (ii) has engaged and there is a rea-
sonable likelihood he may again engage in acts or practices incon-
sistent with just and equitable principles of trade. A national secu-
rities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an ap-
plicant to become a person associated with a member in accordance
with procedures established by the rules of the exchange and re-
quire any person associated with a member, or any class of such
persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with pro-
cedures so established.
(C) A national securities exchange may bar any person from be-
coming associated with a member if such person does not agree (i)
to supply the exchange with such information with respect to its
relationship and dealings with the member as may be specified in
the rules of the exchange and (ii) to permit the examination of its
books and records to verify the accuracy of any information so sup-
plied.
(4) A national securities exchange may limit (A) the number of
members of the exchange and (B) the number of members and des-
ignated representatives of members permitted to effect transactions
on the floor of the exchange without the services of another person
acting as broker: Provided, however, That no national securities ex-
change shall have the authority to decrease the number of member-
ships in such exchange, or the number of members and designated
representatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of such exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, below such number in effect on May 1, 1975, or the date
such exchange was registered with the Commission, whichever is
later: And provided further, That the Commission, in accordance
with the provisions of section 19(c) of this title, may amend the
rules of any national securities exchange to increase (but not to de-
crease) or to remove any limitation on the number of memberships
in such exchange or the number of members or designated rep-
resentatives of members permitted to effect transactions on the
floor of the exchange without the services of another person acting
as broker, if the Commission finds that such limitation imposes a
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of this title.
(d)(1) In any proceeding by a national securities exchange to de-
termine whether a member or person associated with a member
should be disciplined (other than a summary proceeding pursuant
to paragraph (3) of this subsection), the exchange shall bring spe-
cific charges, notify such member or person of, and give him an op-
portunity to defend against, such charges, and keep a record. A de-
termination by the exchange to impose a disciplinary sanction shall
be supported by a statement setting forth—

by the exchange or a member thereof shall be supported by a state-
ment setting forth the specific grounds on which the denial, bar, or
prohibition or limitation is based.
(3) A national securities exchange may summarily (A) suspend a
member or person associated with a member who has been and is
expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization or
barred or suspended from being associated with a member of any
self-regulatory organization, (B) suspend a member who is in such
financial or operating difficulty that the exchange determines and
so notifies the Commission that the member cannot be permitted
to continue to do business as a member with safety to investors,
creditors, other members, or the exchange, or (C) limit or prohibit
any person with respect to access to services offered by the ex-
change if subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph is applicable
to such person or, in the case of a person who is not a member,
if the exchange determines that such person does not meet the
qualification requirements or other prerequisites for such access
and such person cannot be permitted to continue to have such ac-
cess with safety to investors, creditors, members, or the exchange.
Any person aggrieved by any such summary action shall be
promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the exchange in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this sub-
section. The Commission, by order, may stay any such summary
action on its own motion or upon application by any person ag-
grieved thereby, if the Commission determines summarily or after
notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist sole-
ly of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments)
that such stay is consistent with the public interest and the protec-
tion of investors.
(e)(1) On and after the date of enactment of the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1975, no national securities exchange may impose
any schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or
other fees to be charged by its members: Provided, however, That
until May 1, 1976, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall
not prohibit any such exchange from imposing or fixing any sched-
ule of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be
charged by its members for acting as broker on the floor of the ex-

change or as odd-lot dealer: And provided further, That the Com-
mission, in accordance with the provisions of section 19(b) of this
title as modified by the provisions of paragraph (3) of this sub-
section, may—
(A) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose
a reasonable schedule or fix reasonable rates of commissions,
allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged by its mem-
bers for effecting transactions on such exchange prior to No-
vember 1, 1976, if the Commission finds that such schedule or
fixed rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees
are in the public interest; and
(B) permit a national securities exchange, by rule, to impose
a schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts,
or other fees to be charged by its members for effecting trans-
actions on such exchange after November 1, 1976, if the Com-
mission finds that such schedule or fixed rates of commissions,
allowances, discounts, or other fees (i) are reasonable in rela-
tion to the costs of providing the service for which such fees
are charged (and the Commission publishes the standards em-
ployed in adjudging reasonableness) and (ii) do not impose any
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in further-
ance of the purposes of this title, taking into consideration the
competitive effects of permitting such schedule or fixed rates
weighed against the competitive effects of other lawful actions
which the Commission is authorized to take under this title.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19(c) of this title,
the Commission, by rule, may abrogate any exchange rule which
imposes a schedule or fixes rates of commissions, allowances, dis-
counts, or other fees, if the Commission determines that such
schedule or fixed rates are no longer reasonable, in the public in-
terest, or necessary to accomplish the purposes of this title.
(3)(A) Before approving or disapproving any proposed rule change
submitted by a national securities exchange which would impose a
schedule or fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other
fees to be charged by its members for effecting transactions on such
exchange, the Commission shall afford interested persons (i) an op-
portunity for oral presentation of data, views, and arguments and
(ii) with respect to any such rule concerning transactions effected
after November 1, 1976, if the Commission determines there are
disputed issues of material fact, to present such rebuttal submis-
sions and to conduct (or have conducted under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph) such cross-examination as the Commission deter-
mines to be appropriate and required for full disclosure and proper
resolution of such disputed issues of material fact.
(B) The Commission shall prescribe rules and make rulings con-
cerning any proceeding in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph designed to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. Such rules
or rulings may (i) impose reasonable time limits on each interested
person’s oral presentations, and (ii) require any cross-examination
to which a person may be entitled under subparagraph (A) of this
paragraph to be conducted by the Commission on behalf of that
person in such manner as the Commission determines to be appro-
priate and required for full disclosure and proper resolution of dis-
puted issues of material fact.

(C)(i) If any class of persons, the members of which are entitled
to conduct (or have conducted) cross-examination under subpara-
graphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph and which have, in the view
of the Commission, the same or similar interests in the proceeding,
cannot agree upon a single representative of such interests for pur-
poses of cross-examination, the Commission may make rules and
rulings specifying the manner in which such interests shall be rep-
resented and such cross-examination conducted.
(ii) No member of any class of persons with respect to which the
Commission has specified the manner in which its interests shall
be represented pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be
denied, pursuant to such clause (i), the opportunity to conduct (or
have conducted) cross-examination as to issues affecting his par-
ticular interests if he satisfies the Commission that he has made
a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement upon group
representation and there are substantial and relevant issues which
would not be presented adequately by group representation.
(D) A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation and cross-
examination.
(E) In addition to the bases specified in subsection 25(a), a re-
viewing Court may set aside an order of the Commission under sec-
tion 19(b) approving an exchange rule imposing a schedule or fixing
rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees, if the
Court finds—
(1) a Commission determination under subparagraph (A) of
this paragraph that an interested person is not entitled to con-
duct cross-examination or make rebuttal submissions, or
(2) a Commission rule or ruling under subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph limiting the petitioner’s cross-examination or
rebuttal submissions,
has precluded full disclosure and proper resolution
of disputed issues of material fact which were nec-
essary for fair determination by the Commission.
(f) The Commission, by rule or order, as it deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of inves-
tors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or to assure equal regu-
lation, may require—
(1) any person not a member or a designated representative
of a member of a national securities exchange effecting trans-
actions on such exchange without the services of another per-
son acting as a broker, or
(2) any broker or dealer not a member of a national securi-
ties exchange effecting transactions on such exchange on a reg-
ular basis,
to comply with such rules of such exchange as the Commission may
specify.

trades security futures products may register as a national se-
curities exchange solely for the purposes of trading security fu-

modity Futures Trading Commission jointly determine ap-
propriate;
(E) require that the security futures product is cleared
by a clearing agency that has in place provisions for linked
and coordinated clearing with other clearing agencies that
clear security futures products, which permits the security
futures product to be purchased on one market and offset
on another market that trades such product;
(F) require that only a broker or dealer subject to suit-
ability rules comparable to those of a national securities
association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) effect
transactions in the security futures product;

(J) require that the market on which the security futures
product is traded has in place audit trails necessary or ap-
propriate to facilitate the coordinated surveillance required
in subparagraph (I);

tures product is traded has in place procedures to coordi-
nate trading halts between such market and any market
on which any security underlying the security futures
product is traded and other markets on which any related
security is traded; and
(L) require that the margin requirements for a security
futures product comply with the regulations prescribed
pursuant to section 7(c)(2)(B), except that nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to prevent a national se-
curities exchange or national securities association from

uct when it deems such action to be necessary or appro-
priate.
(4) AUTHORITY TO MODIFY CERTAIN LISTING STANDARD RE-
QUIREMENTS.—

Commodity Futures Trading Commission, by rule, regula-
tion, or order, may jointly modify the listing standard re-

and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, by
order, may jointly exempt any person from compliance
with the listing standard requirement specified in sub-

the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of
investors.

MINORITY VIEWS
This bill would amend the Investment Act of 1940 to allow a
closed-end fund to invest up to all its assets in private funds, which
would effectively create a private equity-type fund sold directly to
retail investors. A closed-end fund is a type of mutual fund that
issues a fixed number of shares through a single initial public of-
fering (IPO) to raise capital for its initial investments. Its shares
can then be bought and sold on a stock exchange by ordinary retail
investors, but no new shares will be created and no new money will
flow into the fund. In contrast, an open-ended fund, such as most
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), accepts a con-
stant flow of new investment capital and issues new shares over
time. Private funds—consisting primarily of private equity and
venture capital—invest their capital in private businesses, which
issue securities that are not registered with the SEC.
This bill poses risks to retail investors by exposing them to high-
risk private funds that lack important investor protections and reg-
ulatory guardrails and are not required to disclose critical informa-
tion. The assets that private funds invest in—fledgling startups or
distressed companies in need of a turnaround—are significantly
more risky than public securities, and most of their investments
fail (9 out of 10).1 Permitting a closed-end fund to invest up to all
of its money in private funds—with no particular safeguards pro-
vided by the securities laws for retail investors, such as liquidity
requirements and redemptions rights, will enable these funds to
gain easy access to retail investor money, while at the same time
subjecting retail investors to the higher risks of losses (not to men-
tion the general lack of disclosure) inherent in the average private
fund portfolio company. According to analysis by the Consumer
Federation of America:
‘‘[t]his bill would allow closed-end funds to invest 100%
of their net assets in private funds and still be sold to non-
accredited investors, which would effectively create a pri-
vate fund for retail investors without these investors having
to meet the accredited investor definition. This would in-
crease the amount of risky, illiquid, and opaque private
funds that are sold to retail investors, who may not be able

tiple levels of fund fees, which could make such investments
exorbitantly expensive.’’2
Similarly, Public Citizen, in response to the May 24, 2023, House
Financial Services Committee markup, in a letter to Chairman
McHenry and Ranking Member Waters opposing the bill, wrote, in
part:
‘‘This misleadingly titled bill would expose investors to
greater risk by increasing the limit that a closed-end fund
can invest in a private fund, which are subject to less regu-
lation and disclosure. Currently, the SEC caps the amount
that closed-end funds can invest in private funds at 15% of
net assets, if the closed-end fund is sold to non-accredited
investors, who are investors with lower income and total
wealth. If a closed-end fund has more than 15% of net as-
sets in private funds, it must sell that fund only to accred-
ited investors. This bill would allow closed-end funds to in-
vest 100% of their net assets in private funds and still be
sold to non-accredited investors. Many private funds are
simply bad products that sophisticated investors have
avoided. This bill would allow them to be sloughed off on
those with less investment experience and less income and
savings to lose.’’3
The following groups are opposed to this bill: Public Citizen; Con-
sumer Federation of America; Center for American Progress; Amer-
icans for Financial Reform; North American Securities Administra-
tors Association (NASAA).
For these reasons, we oppose H.R. 3383.
Sincerely,
MAXINE WATERS,
Ranking Member.
