LULU’S LAW
JUNE12, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 1003]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 1003) to require the Federal Com-
munications Commission to issue an order providing that a shark
attack is an event for which a wireless emergency alert may be
transmitted, and for other purposes, having considered the same,
reports favorably thereon without amendment and recommends
that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 1003, Lulu’s Law, is to require the Federal
Communications Commission to issue an order providing that a
shark attack is an event for which a wireless emergency alert may
be transmitted.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in partnership
with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
wireless providers, manages the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)
system. WEA is a national public warning system that alerts the
public about dangerous weather, missing children, and other crit-
ical situations. WEA alerts are sent by authorized public safety of-
ficials through FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning Sys-

tem to participating wireless carriers, who then distribute the alert
to compatible mobile devices in the affected area.1
In June 2024, Lulu Gribbin and McCray Faust were attacked by
a shark at Rosemary Beach, Florida, causing Ms. Gribbin to sus-
tain near-fatal injuries.2 Ninety minutes earlier and just a few
miles away, another woman was attacked by a shark and also suf-
fered severe injuries.3 To help prevent future shark attacks and
honor Ms. Gribbin, Senator Britt introduced this legislation, which
would require the FCC to issue an order providing that a shark at-
tack is an event for which an alert message may be transmitted via
the WEA system.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 1003 was introduced on March 12, 2025, by Senator Britt (for
herself and Senators Schatz, Warnock, Fischer, Ricketts, Capito,
Kaine, Tuberville, and Cassidy) and was referred to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. On
March 24, 2025, Senator Coons was added as a cosponsor. On April
30, 2025, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by
voice vote, ordered S. 1003 reported favorably without amendment.
H.R. 2076, a House companion bill to S. 1003, was introduced on
March 11, 2025, by Representative Palmer and was referred to the
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representa-
tives. On April 9, 2025, Representative Figures was added as a co-
sponsor.
118th Congress
S. 4832, Lulu’s Law, was introduced on July 30, 2024, by Senator
Britt (for herself and Senator Capito) and was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
The bill had six additional cosponsors.
H.R. 9376, a House companion bill to S. 4832, was introduced on
August 16, 2024, by Representative Palmer (for himself and Rep-
resentatives Dunn, Sewell, Moore, Strong, Aderholt, Rogers, and
Carl) and was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce
of the House of Representatives.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
1‘‘Wireless Emergency Alerts,’’ Federal Communications Commission (https://www.fcc.gov/
consumers/guides/wireless-emergency-alerts-wea).

S. 1003 would require the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to issue a rule that shark attacks are an event for which
wireless emergency alerts may be transmitted.
Based on the cost of similar activities, CBO estimates that the
administrative costs to implement S. 1003 would be insignificant.
Because the FCC is authorized to collect fees each year sufficient
to offset the appropriated costs of its regulatory activities, CBO es-
timates that the net cost to the FCC would be negligible, assuming
appropriation actions consistent with that authority.
If the FCC increases annual fee collections to offset the costs of
implementing provisions in the bill, S. 1003 would increase the cost
of an existing private-sector mandate on entities required to pay
those fees. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate
would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold es-
tablished in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for pri-
vate-sector mandates ($203 million in 2025, adjusted annually for
inflation).
S. 1003 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in
UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Margot Berman (for
federal costs) and Rachel Austin (for mandates). The estimate was
reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 1003 does not create any new programs, the legisla-
tion will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in
no additional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no
further effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.

CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as ‘‘Lulu’s
Law’’.
Section 2. Wireless emergency alerts.
This section would define the term ‘‘Alert Message’’ and would
require that no later than 180 days after the date of the enactment
of this Act, the FCC issue an order to provide that a shark attack
is an event for which an Alert Message may be transmitted.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
