tect consumers from the risk of fires associated with rechargeable
lithium-ion batteries used in micromobility devices.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Lithium-Ion batteries are lightweight, rechargeable batteries
found in many consumer electronics and are often used in micro-
mobility devices, such as electric bikes and scooters. When poorly
made, lacking adequate safety testing, charged improperly, or dam-
aged, these batteries are prone to ignite and the associated fires
may be accompanied by explosions and the release of toxic gas.1 As
micromobility devices have risen in popularity, the use of lithium-
ion batteries has increased, creating the need for safety standards.
Currently, there is no federal safety standard for lithium-ion bat-
teries2 and many uncertified and untested batteries are available
for purchase.3
From 2019 to 2023, the Fire Department of New York reported
more than 400 fires, 300 injuries, and twelve deaths caused by lith-
ium-ion batteries in New York City alone.4 Urban areas are at an
increased risk for injuries and property damage due to high popu-
lation density, but Lithium-ion battery fires impact communities
across the United States. Consumer advocates and fire profes-
sionals have warned consumers only to use certified and tested
products and called for strong federal safety standards.5
COMMITTEE ACTION
On September 27, 2023, the Subcommittee on Innovation, Data,
and Commerce held a hearing on H.R. 1797.6 The hearing was en-
titled, ‘‘Proposals to Enhance Product Safety and Transparency for
Americans.’’ The Subcommittee received testimony from:
• Kathleen Callahan, Owner, Xpertech Auto Repair;
• Scott Benavidez, Chairman, Automotive Service Associa-
tion;

communications and Fraud, National Consumers League; and
• David Touhey, Certified Venue Expert, Principal, Connett
Consulting (IAVM, Fix the Tix Coalition member, former presi-
dent of venues, Monumental Sports); and Adjunct Professor of

met in open markup session and ordered H.R. 973, without amend-
ment, favorably reported to the House by a voice vote.

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 allows the Act to be cited as the ‘‘Setting Consumer
Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act.’’
Section 2. Consumer product safety standard for certain batteries
Section 2 requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to
promulgate, under 5 U.S.C. 553, the provisions of ANSI/CAN/UL
2271, ANSI/CAN/UL 2849, and ANSI/CAN/UL 2272, and any revi-
sions of such standards, as a final consumer product safety stand-
ard for consumer products, as defined in section 3(a)(5) of the Con-
sumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(5)). Such a standard
will be treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated
under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C.
2058). Section 2 also requires the CPSC to submit a report to Con-
gress no later than 5 years after the date of enactment of this act
regarding fires, explosions, and other hazards relating to lithium-
ion batteries used in micromobility devices during the period be-
tween date of enactment and the report date.
