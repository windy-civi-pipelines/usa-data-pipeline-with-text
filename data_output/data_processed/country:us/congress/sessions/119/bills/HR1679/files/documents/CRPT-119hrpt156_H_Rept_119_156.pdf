2025, and referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
H.R. 1679 would direct the Secretary of Commerce and the Comp-
troller General of the United States to conduct an interagency re-
view and report on ways to increase global competitiveness of the
U.S. in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) from responsible
private-sector entities based in trusted countries and economies.
The review conducted shall include but not be limited to the cur-
rent economic impact of FDI in the United States, trends in global
cross-border investment, Federal Government policies that are
closely linked to the ability of the U.S. to attract and retain FDI,
FDI as compared to domestic direct investment, barriers to the
U.S. competitiveness to attract FDI, and ongoing U.S. efforts to at-
tract FDI. The bill would also require the Secretary of Commerce
and the Comptroller General to report to Congress with rec-
ommendations for increasing global competitiveness of the U.S. in
attracting FDI.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
FDI is a category of investments into an ownership stake of a
company that originates from foreign sources whether they are
made by an investor, company, or a government from another coun-
try. FDI has proven to be critical for a country’s economy, including
during financial hardships,1 and creates a pathway for countries to
manufacture new and emerging technologies.
In order for the U.S. to remain the global leader in the deploy-
ment of critical emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles,
and the many other applications of artificial intelligence, quantum
computing, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and ad-
vanced and new materials, it must remove unnecessary barriers
prohibiting the expanse of FDI from trusted countries and econo-
mies. The U.S. must also promote policies to ensure it remains the
premier global destination to invest, hire, innovate, provide serv-
ices, and manufacture products, including emerging technologies.
COMMITTEE ACTION
On March 4, 2025, the full Committee on Energy and Commerce
met in open markup session and ordered H.R. 1679, without
amendment, favorably reported to the House by a voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
Section 1 designates that the short title may be cited as the
‘‘Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2025’’.
Section. 2. Sense of Congress
Section 2 provides the Sense of Congress expressing the impor-
tance of the ability of the U.S. to attract FDI from responsible pri-
vate-sector entities based in trusted countries, the need to remove
barriers prohibiting larger numbers of inbound FDI, the need to
promote policies that encourage inbound FDI from responsible pri-
vate-sector entities based in trusted countries and economies and
that ensure the U.S. remains the global leader in developing and
deploying emerging technologies. The sense of Congress also ex-
presses that FDI should strengthen the U.S. security, improve the
domestic standard of living and U.S. jobs, and that any FDI by
companies or other entities owned, directed, supported, or influ-
enced by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a threat to U.S.

security and merits an aggressive policy to protect U.S. interests,
jobs, intellectual property, and security.
Section. 3. Foreign direct investment review
Section 3 requires the Secretary of the Department of Commerce
and the Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation
with the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group estab-
lished pursuant to Executive Order 13577, and in consultation with
the heads of other relevant agencies, to conduct an interagency re-
view of the global competitiveness of the U.S. in attracting FDI
from responsible private-sector entities based in foreign countries.
The section requires the review to include certain aspects including
but not limited to, the economic impact of FDI in the U.S.; Federal
Government policies that encourage the attraction and retention of
FDI; FDI as compared to direct investment by domestic entities;
FDI that takes the form of greenfield investments; specific informa-
tion on the efforts and the prevalence of investments made with
the backing of the CCP, especially investments related to manufac-
turing, services, trade (with an emphasis on digital trade), and
jobs, and how such efforts result in the displacement, offshoring, or
outsourcing, including the impact of such investments on supply
chains; the adequacy of efforts by the Federal Government to en-
courage and facilitate U.S. inbound FDI; and other barriers to the
ability of the U.S. to compete globally in an increasingly digital
economy.
Section 3 clarifies that the review may not address laws or poli-
cies relating to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.
Section 3 also requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide an
opportunity for public comment on the matters covered by the re-
view and subsequently provide a report to Congress on the findings
of the review, and provide recommendations for increasing the
global competitiveness of the U.S. in attracting FDI from respon-
sible private-sector entities based in trusted countries.
Lastly, section 3 defines terms commonly used in the legislation.
