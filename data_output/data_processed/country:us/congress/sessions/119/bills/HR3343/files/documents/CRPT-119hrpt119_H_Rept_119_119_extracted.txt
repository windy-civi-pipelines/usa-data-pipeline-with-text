SEC. 2. FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR EMERGING GROWTH COM-

17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto, for any period
prior to the earliest audited period of the emerging growth company pre-
sented in connection with its initial public offering and, thereafter, in no
event shall an issuer that was an emerging growth company but is no
longer an emerging growth company be required to present financial state-
ments of the issuer (or acquired company financial statements or informa-
tion otherwise required under section 210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title
17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto) for any period
prior to the earliest audited period of the emerging growth company pre-
sented in connection with its initial public offering; and’’.
(b) SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.—Section 12(b)(1)(K) of the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l(b)(1)(K)) is amended by striking ‘‘firm’’ and insert-
ing ‘‘firm, provided that the application of an emerging growth company need not
present acquired company financial statements or information otherwise required
under section 210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations,
or any successor thereto, for any period prior to the earliest audited period of the
emerging growth company presented in connection with its application and, there-
after, in no event shall an issuer that was an emerging growth company but is no
longer an emerging growth company be required to present financial statements of
the issuer (or acquired company financial statements or information otherwise re-
quired under section 210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal Regu-
lations, or any successor thereto) for any period prior to the earliest audited period
of the emerging growth company presented in connection with any application under
this subsection’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3343, the Greenlighting Growth Act, was introduced on May
13, 2025, by Representative Mike Haridopolos (FL–08). H.R. 3343
establishes that an emerging growth company (EGC), as well as
any issuer that went public using EGC disclosure obligations, only
needs to provide two years of audited financial statements.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Some misconceptions have occurred relating to the JOBS Act and
the ability for an EGC to provide only two years of audited finan-
cial statements in its IPO registration statement. This concession
applies only to the IPO registration statement and does not exempt
EGCs from providing three years of audited financial statements in
other filings, such as annual reports. This has occurred occasion-
ally, for example, in the case of acquired company financial state-
ments and for follow-on offerings involving an EGC that lost its
EGC status during IPO registration.
This bill updates the EGC financial statement accommodation to
clarify that an EGC need not provide financial statements for a pe-
riod earlier than the two years of audited financial statements re-
quired in its IPO registration statement. This update increases effi-
ciency by ensuring that EGCs can rely on the JOBS Act’s scaled
disclosure accommodation by eliminating aberrational results that
have sometimes required burdensome and unnecessary financial
statement obligations. Absent this clarification, in some scenarios
EGC issuers have needed to provide audited financial statements
for financial periods preceding the earliest period in their IPO reg-

istration statements. This bill clearly establishes that an EGC need
not, under any circumstances, provide financial statements for any
period preceding the earliest period required to be presented in the
IPO registration statement.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
117TH CONGRESS
On December 2, 2022, Representative Patrick McHenry intro-
duced H.R. 9411, a bill to amend the Federal securities laws to
specify the periods for which financial statements are required to be
provided by an emerging growth company, and for other purposes.
This bill is an earlier iteration of H.R. 3343. The bill was referred
solely to the Committee on Financial Services.
118TH CONGRESS
On April 13, 2023, then-Chairman McHenry introduced H.R.
2608, a bill to amend the Federal securities laws to specify the peri-

an earlier iteration of H.R. 3343. The bill was referred solely to the
Committee on Financial Services. The Subcommittee on Capital
Markets of the Committee on Financial Services held a hearing to
examine matters relating to H.R. 2608 on March 9, 2023. On April
26, 2023, the Committee on Financial Services ordered H.R. 2608

duced H.R.3343, the Greenlighting Growth Act, with Representa-
tive Ann Wagner (R–MO) as an original cosponsor. The bill was re-
ferred solely to the Committee on Financial Services. The bill was

American Capital: Strengthening Public and Private Markets by
Increasing Investor Access and Facilitating Capital Formation’’ and
the March 25, 2025, hearing titled, ‘‘Beyond Silicon Valley: Ex-
panding Access to Capital Across America.’’
On May 20, 2025, the Committee met in open session to consider,

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3343 is to establish that an
Emerging Growth Company (EGC), as well as any issuer that went
public using EGC disclosure obligations, only needs to provide two
years of audited financial statements.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3343. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the cost
estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

INFORMATION REQUIRED IN REGISTRATION STATEMENT
SEC. 7.
(a) INFORMATION REQUIRED IN REGISTRATION STATEMENT.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The registration statement, when relating
to a security other than a security issued by a foreign govern-
ment, or political subdivision thereof, shall contain the infor-
mation, and be accompanied by the documents, specified in
Schedule A, and when relating to a security issued by a foreign
government, or political subdivision thereof, shall contain the

information, and be accompanied by the documents, specified
in Schedule B; except that the Commission may by rules or
regulations provide that any such information or document
need not be included in respect of any class of issuers or secu-
rities if it finds that the requirement of such information or
document is inapplicable to such class and that disclosure fully
adequate for the protection of investors is otherwise required
to be included within the registration statement. If any ac-
countant, engineer, or appraiser, or any person whose profes-
sion gives authority to a statement made by him, is named as
having prepared or certified any part of the registration state-
ment, or is named as having prepared or certified a report or
valuation for use in connection with the registration statement,
the written consent of such person shall be filed with the reg-
istration statement. If any such person is named as having
prepared or certified a report or valuation (other than a public
official document or statement) which is used in connection
with the registration statement, but is not named as having
prepared or certified such report or valuation for use in connec-
tion with the registration statement, the written consent of
such person shall be filed with the registration statement un-
less the Commission dispenses with such filing as impracti-
cable or as involving undue hardship on the person filing the
registration statement. Any such registration statement shall
contain such other information, and be accompanied by such
other documents, as the Commission may by rules or regula-
tions require as being necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.
(2) TREATMENT OF EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES.—An
emerging growth company—
(A) need not present more than 2 years of audited finan-
cial statements in order for the registration statement of
such emerging growth company with respect to an initial
public offering of its common equity securities to be effec-
tive, and in any other registration statement to be filed
with the Commission, an emerging growth company need
not present selected financial data in accordance with sec-
tion 229.301 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, for
any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in
connection with its initial public offering; øand¿
(B) need not present acquired company financial state-
ments or information otherwise required under section

Section 8:
210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal
Regulations, or any successor thereto, for any period prior
to the earliest audited period of the emerging growth com-
pany presented in connection with its initial public offering
and, thereafter, in no event shall an issuer that was an
emerging growth company but is no longer an emerging
growth company be required to present financial statements
of the issuer (or acquired company financial statements or
information otherwise required under section 210.3–05 or

Section 9:
section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or
any successor thereto) for any period prior to the earliest
audited period of the emerging growth company presented
in connection with its initial public offering; and

ø(B)¿ (C) may not be required to comply with any new
or revised financial accounting standard until such date
that a company that is not an issuer (as defined under sec-
tion 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C.
7201(a))) is required to comply with such new or revised
accounting standard, if such standard applies to companies
that are not issuers.
(b)(1) The Commission shall prescribe special rules with respect
to registration statements filed by any issuer that is a blank check
company. Such rules may, as the Commission determines nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors—
(A) require such issuers to provide timely disclosure, prior to
or after such statement becomes effective under section 8, of (i)
information regarding the company to be acquired and the spe-
cific application of the proceeds of the offering, or (ii) additional
information necessary to prevent such statement from being
misleading;
(B) place limitations on the use of such proceeds and the dis-
tribution of securities by such issuer until the disclosures re-
quired under subparagraph (A) have been made; and
(C) provide a right of rescission to shareholders of such secu-
rities.
(2) The Commission may, as it determines consistent with the
public interest and the protection of investors, by rule or order ex-
empt any issuer or class of issuers from the rules prescribed under
paragraph (1).
(3) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term
‘‘blank check company’’ means any development stage company
that is issuing a penny stock (within the meaning of section
3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and that—
(A) has no specific business plan or purpose; or
(B) has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an
unidentified company or companies.
(c) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall adopt regulations
under this subsection requiring each issuer of an asset-backed
security to disclose, for each tranche or class of security, infor-
mation regarding the assets backing that security.
(2) CONTENT OF REGULATIONS.—In adopting regulations
under this subsection, the Commission shall—
(A) set standards for the format of the data provided by
issuers of an asset-backed security, which shall, to the ex-
tent feasible, facilitate comparison of such data across se-
curities in similar types of asset classes; and
(B) require issuers of asset-backed securities, at a min-
imum, to disclose asset-level or loan-level data, if such
data are necessary for investors to independently perform
due diligence, including—
(i) data having unique identifiers relating to loan
brokers or originators;
(ii) the nature and extent of the compensation of the
broker or originator of the assets backing the security;
and

(iii) the amount of risk retention by the originator
and the securitizer of such assets.
(3) DATA STANDARDS FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES DISCLO-
SURES.—
(A) REQUIREMENT.—The Commission shall, by rule,
adopt data standards for all disclosures required under
this subsection.
(B) CONSISTENCY.—The data standards required under
subparagraph (A) shall incorporate, and ensure compat-
ibility with (to the extent feasible), all applicable data
standards established in the rules promulgated under sec-
tion 124 of the Financial Stability Act of 2010, including,
to the extent practicable, by having the characteristics de-
scribed in clauses (i) through (vi) of subsection (c)(1)(B) of
such section 124.
(d) REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.—
Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this sub-

Section 10:
section, the Commission shall issue rules relating to the registra-
tion statement required to be filed by any issuer of an asset-backed
security (as that term is defined in section 3(a)(77) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that require any issuer of an asset-backed
security—
(1) to perform a review of the assets underlying the asset-
backed security; and
(2) to disclose the nature of the review under paragraph (1).

(2) Such copies of articles of incorporation, bylaws, trust in-
dentures, or corresponding documents by whatever name
known, underwriting arrangements, and other similar docu-
ments of, and voting trust agreements with respect to, the
issuer and any person directly or indirectly controlling or con-
trolled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the
issuer as the Commission may require as necessary or appro-
priate for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair
dealing in the security.
(3) Such copies of material contracts, referred to in para-
graph (1)(I) above, as the Commission may require as nec-
essary or appropriate for the proper protection of investors and
to insure fair dealing in the security.
(c) If in the judgment of the Commission any information re-
quired under subsection (b) of this section is inapplicable to any
specified class or classes of issuers, the Commission shall require
in lieu thereof the submission of such other information of com-
parable character as it may deem applicable to such class of
issuers.
(d) If the exchange authorities certify to the Commission that the
security has been approved by the exchange for listing and reg-
istration, the registration shall become effective thirty days after
the receipt of such certification by the Commission or within such
shorter period of time as the Commission may determine. A secu-
rity registered with a national securities exchange may be with-
drawn or stricken from listing and registration in accordance with
the rules of the exchange and, upon such terms as the Commission
may deem necessary to impose for the protection of investors, upon
application by the issuer or the exchange to the Commission;
whereupon the issuer shall be relieved from further compliance
with the provisions of this section and section 13 of this title and
any rules or regulations under such sections as to the securities so
withdrawn or stricken. An unissued security may be registered
only in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commis-
sion may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public inter-
est or for the protection of investors.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the
Commission may by such rules and regulations as it deems nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors permit securities listed on any exchange at the time the
registration of such exchange as a national securities exchange be-
comes effective, to be registered for a period ending not later than
July 1, 1935, without complying with the provisions of this section.
(f)(1)(A) Notwithstanding the preceding subsections of this sec-
tion, any national securities exchange, in accordance with the re-
quirements of this subsection and the rules hereunder, may extend
unlisted trading privileges to—
(i) any security that is listed and registered on a national se-
curities exchange, subject to subparagraph (B); and
(ii) any security that is otherwise registered pursuant to this

Section 12:
section, or that would be required to be so registered except for
the exemption from registration provided in subparagraph (B)
or (G) of subsection (g)(2), subject to subparagraph (E) of this
paragraph.

(B) A national securities exchange may not extend unlisted trad-
ing privileges to a security described in subparagraph (A)(i) during
such interval, if any, after the commencement of an initial public
offering of such security, as is or may be required pursuant to sub-
paragraph (C).
(C) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the
Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994, the Commission shall pre-
scribe, by rule or regulation, the duration of the interval referred
to in subparagraph (B), if any, as the Commission determines to be
necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets, the protection of investors and the public interest, or oth-
erwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. Until the earlier
of the effective date of such rule or regulation or 240 days after
such date of enactment, such interval shall begin at the opening of
trading on the day on which such security commences trading on
the national securities exchange with which such security is reg-
istered and end at the conclusion of the next day of trading.
(D) The Commission may prescribe, by rule or regulation such
additional procedures or requirements for extending unlisted trad-
ing privileges to any security as the Commission deems necessary
or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the
protection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(E) No extension of unlisted trading privileges to securities de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(ii) may occur except pursuant to a
rule, regulation, or order of the Commission approving such exten-
sion or extensions. In promulgating such rule or regulation or in
issuing such order, the Commission—
(i) shall find that such extension or extensions of unlisted
trading privileges is consistent with the maintenance of fair
and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public
interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title;
(ii) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
securities, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such securities, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(iii) shall not permit a national securities exchange to extend
unlisted trading privileges to such securities if any rule of such
national securities exchange would unreasonably impair the
ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such secu-
rities for its own account, or would unreasonably restrict com-
petition among dealers in such securities or between such deal-
ers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists
and such dealers who are not specialists.
(F) An exchange may continue to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges in accordance with this paragraph only if the exchange and
the subject security continue to satisfy the requirements for eligi-
bility under this paragraph, including any rules and regulations
issued by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph, except that
unlisted trading privileges may continue with regard to securities
which had been admitted on such exchange prior to July 1, 1964,
notwithstanding the failure to satisfy such requirements. If un-

listed trading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to
this subparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that secu-
rity, unless the exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.
(G) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) a security is the subject of an initial public offering if—
(I) the offering of the subject security is registered under
the Securities Act of 1933; and
(II) the issuer of the security, immediately prior to filing
the registration statement with respect to the offering, was
not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or
15(d) of this title; and
(ii) an initial public offering of such security commences at
the opening of trading on the day on which such security com-
mences trading on the national securities exchange with which
such security is registered.
(2)(A) At any time within 60 days of commencement of trading
on an exchange of a security pursuant to unlisted trading privi-
leges, the Commission may summarily suspend such unlisted trad-
ing privileges on the exchange. Such suspension shall not be re-
viewable under section 25 of this title and shall not be deemed to
be a final agency action for purposes of section 704 of title 5,
United States Code. Upon such suspension—
(i) the exchange shall cease trading in the security by the
close of business on the date of such suspension, or at such
time as the Commission may prescribe by rule or order for the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of this title; and
(ii) if the exchange seeks to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges to the security, the exchange shall file an application to
reinstate its ability to do so with the Commission pursuant to
such procedures as the Commission may prescribe by rule or
order for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the pro-
tection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(B) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect
until the Commission, by order, grants approval of an application
to reinstate, as described in subparagraph (A)(ii).
(C) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall not affect the va-
lidity or force of an extension of unlisted trading privileges in effect
prior to such suspension.
(D) The Commission shall not approve an application by a na-
tional securities exchange to reinstate its ability to extend unlisted
trading privileges to a security unless the Commission finds, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that the extension of unlisted
trading privileges pursuant to such application is consistent with
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of this title. If the application is made to reinstate un-
listed trading privileges to a security described in paragraph
(1)(A)(ii), the Commission—
(i) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
security, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such a security, and the de-

sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(ii) shall not grant any such application if any rule of the na-
tional securities exchange making application under this sub-

Section 13:
section would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to so-
licit or effect transactions in such security for its own account,
or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers in
such security or between such dealers acting in the capacity of
marketmakers who are specialists and such dealers who are
not specialists.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the Commission shall by
rules and regulations suspend unlisted trading privileges in whole
or in part for any or all classes of securities for a period not exceed-
ing twelve months, if it deems such suspension necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or to
prevent evasion of the purposes of this title.
(4) On the application of the issuer of any security for which un-
listed trading privileges on any exchange have been continued or
extended pursuant to this subsection, or of any broker or dealer
who makes or creates a market for such security, or of any other
person having a bona fide interest in the question of termination
or suspension of such unlisted trading privileges, or on its own mo-
tion, the Commission shall by order terminate, or suspend for a pe-
riod not exceeding twelve months, such unlisted trading privileges
for such security if the Commission finds, after appropriate notice
and opportunity for hearing, that such termination or suspension
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protec-
tion of investors.
(5) In any proceeding under this subsection in which appropriate
notice and opportunity for hearing are required, notice of not less
than ten days to the applicant in such proceeding, to the issuer of
the security involved, to the exchange which is seeking to continue
or extend or has continued or extended unlisted trading privileges
for such security, and to the exchange, if any, on which such secu-
rity is listed and registered, shall be deemed adequate notice, and
any broker or dealer who makes or creates a market for such secu-
rity, and any other person having a bona fide interest in such pro-
ceeding, shall upon application be entitled to be heard.
(6) Any security for which unlisted trading privileges are contin-
ued or extended pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to be
registered on a national securities exchange within the meaning of
this title. The powers and duties of the Commission under this title
shall be applicable to the rules of an exchange in respect to any
such security. The Commission may, by such rules and regulations
as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors, either unconditionally or upon specified
terms and conditions, or for stated periods, exempt such securities
from the operation of any provision of section 13, 14, or 16 of this
title.

ended on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by either—
(i) 2,000 persons, or
(ii) 500 persons who are not accredited investors (as such
term is defined by the Commission), and
(B) in the case of an issuer that is a bank, a savings and
loan holding company (as defined in section 10 of the Home

1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), not later than 120 days after the last
day of its first fiscal year ended after the effective date of this
subsection, on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by 2,000 or more persons,
register such security by filing with the Commission a registration
statement (and such copies thereof as the Commission may require)
with respect to such security containing such information and docu-
ments as the Commission may specify comparable to that which is
required in an application to register a security pursuant to sub-

Section 14:
section (b) of this section. Each such registration statement shall
become effective sixty days after filing with the Commission or
within such shorter period as the Commission may direct. Until
such registration statement becomes effective it shall not be
deemed filed for the purposes of section 18 of this title. Any issuer
may register any class of equity security not required to be reg-
istered by filing a registration statement pursuant to the provisions
of this paragraph. The Commission is authorized to extend the date
upon which any issuer or class of issuers is required to register a
security pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in respect
of—
(A) any security listed and registered on a national securities
exchange.
(B) any security issued by an investment company registered
pursuant to section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
(C) any security, other than permanent stock, guaranty

vised and examined by State or Federal authority having su-
pervision over any such institution.

pany under section 3(c)(10)(B) of the Investment Company Act

associations, if such federation possesses no greater powers or
purposes than cooperative associations so defined.
(F) any security issued by a mutual or cooperative organiza-
tion which supplies a commodity or service primarily for the
benefit of its members and operates not for pecuniary profit,
but only if the security is part of a class issuable only to per-
sons who purchase commodities or services from the issuer, the
security is transferable only to a successor in interest or occu-
pancy of premises serviced or to be served by the issuer, and
no dividends are payable to the holder of the security.
(G) any security issued by an insurance company if all of the
following conditions are met:
(i) Such insurance company is required to and does file
an annual statement with the Commissioner of Insurance
(or other officer or agency performing a similar function)
of its domiciliary State, and such annual statement con-
forms to that prescribed by the National Association of In-
surance Commissioners or in the determination of such
State commissioner, officer or agency substantially con-
forms to that so prescribed.
(ii) Such insurance company is subject to regulation by
its domiciliary State of proxies, consents, or authorizations
in respect of securities issued by such company and such
regulation conforms to that prescribed by the National As-
sociation of Insurance Commissioners.
(iii) After July 1, 1966, the purchase and sales of securi-
ties issued by such insurance company by beneficial own-
ers, directors, or officers of such company are subject to
regulation (including reporting) by its domiciliary State
substantially in the manner provided in section 16 of this
title.
(H) any interest or participation in any collective trust funds
maintained by a bank or in a separate account maintained by
an insurance company which interest or participation is issued
in connection with (i) a stock-bonus, pension, or profit-sharing
plan which meets the requirements for qualification under sec-
tion 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, (ii) an annuity
plan which meets the requirements for deduction of the em-
ployer’s contribution under section 404(a)(2) of such Code, or
(iii) a church plan, company, or account that is excluded from

(3) The Commission may by rules or regulations or, on its own
motion, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order, exempt
from this subsection any security of a foreign issuer, including any
certificate of deposit for such a security, if the Commission finds
that such exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with
the protection of investors.
(4) Registration of any class of security pursuant to this sub-

Section 15:
section shall be terminated ninety days, or such shorter period as
the Commission may determine, after the issuer files a certification
with the Commission that the number of holders of record of such

Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), 1,200 persons persons. The
Commission shall after notice and opportunity for hearing deny ter-
mination of registration if it finds that the certification is untrue.
Termination of registration shall be deferred pending final deter-
mination on the question of denial.
(5) For the purposes of this subsection the term ‘‘class’’ shall in-
clude all securities of an issuer which are of substantially similar
character and the holders of which enjoy substantially similar
rights and privileges. The Commission may for the purpose of this
subsection define by rules and regulations the terms ‘‘total assets’’
and ‘‘held of record’’ as it deems necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors in order to prevent
circumvention of the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of
this subsection, a security futures product shall not be considered
a class of equity security of the issuer of the securities underlying
the security futures product. For purposes of determining whether
an issuer is required to register a security with the Commission
pursuant to paragraph (1), the definition of ‘‘held of record’’ shall
not include securities held by persons who received the securities
pursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions ex-
empted from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Secu-
rities Act of 1933.
(6) EXCLUSION FOR PERSONS HOLDING CERTAIN SECURITIES.—
The Commission shall, by rule, exempt, conditionally or uncon-
ditionally, securities acquired pursuant to an offering made
under section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933 from the provi-
sions of this subsection.
(h) The Commission may by rules and regulations, or upon appli-
cation of an interested person, by order, after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, exempt in whole or in part any issuer or class
of issuers from the provisions of subsection (g) of this section or
from section 13, 14, or 15(d) or may exempt from section 16 any
officer, director, or beneficial owner of securities of any issuer, any
security of which is required to be registered pursuant to sub-

Section 16:
section (g) hereof, upon such terms and conditions and for such pe-
riod as it deems necessary or appropriate, if the Commission finds,
by reason of the number of public investors, amount of trading in-
terest in the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of
the issuer, income or assets of the issuer, or otherwise, that such
action is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection
of investors. The Commission may, for the purposes of any of the
above-mentioned sections or subsections of this title, classify
issuers and prescribe requirements appropriate for each such class.

ciations the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the

are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are
vested in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Comp-
troller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall
have the power to make such rules and regulations as may be nec-
essary for the execution of the functions vested in them as provided
in this subsection. In carrying out their responsibilities under this
subsection, the agencies named in the first sentence of this sub-

Section 17:
section shall issue substantially similar regulations to regulations
and rules issued by the Commission under sections 10A(m), 12, 13,
14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f) and 16 of this Act, and sections 302, 303,
304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, unless they find that implementation of substantially similar
regulations with respect to insured banks and insured institutions
are not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for protec-
tion of investors, and publish such findings, and the detailed rea-
sons therefor, in the Federal Register. Such regulations of the
above-named agencies, or the reasons for failure to publish such
substantially similar regulations to those of the Commission, shall
be published in the Federal Register within 120 days of the date
of enactment of this subsection, and, thereafter, within 60 days of
any changes made by the Commission in its relevant regulations
and rules.
(j) The Commission is authorized, by order, as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors to deny, to suspend
the effective date of, to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve
months, or to revoke the registration of a security, if the Commis-
sion finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of such security has failed to comply with any provi-
sion of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder. No mem-
ber of a national securities exchange, broker, or dealer shall make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate com-
merce to effect any transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale
of, any security the registration of which has been and is sus-
pended or revoked pursuant to the preceding sentence.
(k) TRADING SUSPENSIONS; EMERGENCY AUTHORITY.—
(1) TRADING SUSPENSIONS.—If in its opinion the public inter-
est and the protection of investors so require, the Commission
is authorized by order—
(A) summarily to suspend trading in any security (other
than an exempted security) for a period not exceeding 10
business days, and
(B) summarily to suspend all trading on any national se-
curities exchange or otherwise, in securities other than ex-
empted securities, for a period not exceeding 90 calendar
days.
The action described in subparagraph (B) shall not take effect
unless the Commission notifies the President of its decision
and the President notifies the Commission that the President
does not disapprove of such decision. If the actions described
in subparagraph (A) or (B) involve a security futures product,
the Commission shall consult with and consider the views of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

(2) EMERGENCY ORDERS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Commission, in an emergency,
may by order summarily take such action to alter, supple-
ment, suspend, or impose requirements or restrictions with

curities laws, as the Commission determines is necessary
in the public interest and for the protection of investors—
(i) to maintain or restore fair and orderly securities
markets (other than markets in exempted securities);
(ii) to ensure prompt, accurate, and safe clearance
and settlement of transactions in securities (other
than exempted securities); or

kets; or

transactions (other than transactions in exempted
securities).

sion under this paragraph may not continue in effect for
more than 10 business days, including extensions.
(C) EXTENSION.—An order of the Commission under this
paragraph may be extended to continue in effect for more
than 10 business days if, at the time of the extension, the
Commission finds that the emergency still exists and de-
termines that the continuation of the order beyond 10
business days is necessary in the public interest and for
the protection of investors to attain an objective described
in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A). In no event
shall an order of the Commission under this paragraph
continue in effect for more than 30 calendar days.

paragraph (A) involve a security futures product, the Com-

The President may direct that action taken by the Commission
under paragraph (1)(B) or paragraph (2) of this subsection
shall not continue in effect.
(4) COMPLIANCE WITH ORDERS.—No member of a national se-
curities exchange, broker, or dealer shall make use of the mails

SEC. 2. FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR EMERGING GROWTH COM-

17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto, for any period
prior to the earliest audited period of the emerging growth company pre-
sented in connection with its initial public offering and, thereafter, in no
event shall an issuer that was an emerging growth company but is no
longer an emerging growth company be required to present financial state-
ments of the issuer (or acquired company financial statements or informa-
tion otherwise required under section 210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title
17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto) for any period
prior to the earliest audited period of the emerging growth company pre-
sented in connection with its initial public offering; and’’.
(b) SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.—Section 12(b)(1)(K) of the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l(b)(1)(K)) is amended by striking ‘‘firm’’ and insert-
ing ‘‘firm, provided that the application of an emerging growth company need not
present acquired company financial statements or information otherwise required
under section 210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations,
or any successor thereto, for any period prior to the earliest audited period of the
emerging growth company presented in connection with its application and, there-
after, in no event shall an issuer that was an emerging growth company but is no
longer an emerging growth company be required to present financial statements of
the issuer (or acquired company financial statements or information otherwise re-
quired under section 210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal Regu-
lations, or any successor thereto) for any period prior to the earliest audited period
of the emerging growth company presented in connection with any application under
this subsection’’.
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 3343, the Greenlighting Growth Act, was introduced on May
13, 2025, by Representative Mike Haridopolos (FL–08). H.R. 3343
establishes that an emerging growth company (EGC), as well as
any issuer that went public using EGC disclosure obligations, only
needs to provide two years of audited financial statements.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Some misconceptions have occurred relating to the JOBS Act and
the ability for an EGC to provide only two years of audited finan-
cial statements in its IPO registration statement. This concession
applies only to the IPO registration statement and does not exempt
EGCs from providing three years of audited financial statements in
other filings, such as annual reports. This has occurred occasion-
ally, for example, in the case of acquired company financial state-
ments and for follow-on offerings involving an EGC that lost its
EGC status during IPO registration.
This bill updates the EGC financial statement accommodation to
clarify that an EGC need not provide financial statements for a pe-
riod earlier than the two years of audited financial statements re-
quired in its IPO registration statement. This update increases effi-
ciency by ensuring that EGCs can rely on the JOBS Act’s scaled
disclosure accommodation by eliminating aberrational results that
have sometimes required burdensome and unnecessary financial
statement obligations. Absent this clarification, in some scenarios
EGC issuers have needed to provide audited financial statements
for financial periods preceding the earliest period in their IPO reg-

istration statements. This bill clearly establishes that an EGC need
not, under any circumstances, provide financial statements for any
period preceding the earliest period required to be presented in the
IPO registration statement.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
117TH CONGRESS
On December 2, 2022, Representative Patrick McHenry intro-
duced H.R. 9411, a bill to amend the Federal securities laws to
specify the periods for which financial statements are required to be
provided by an emerging growth company, and for other purposes.
This bill is an earlier iteration of H.R. 3343. The bill was referred
solely to the Committee on Financial Services.
118TH CONGRESS
On April 13, 2023, then-Chairman McHenry introduced H.R.
2608, a bill to amend the Federal securities laws to specify the peri-
ods for which financial statements are required to be provided by
an emerging growth company, and for other purposes. This bill is
an earlier iteration of H.R. 3343. The bill was referred solely to the
Committee on Financial Services. The Subcommittee on Capital
Markets of the Committee on Financial Services held a hearing to
examine matters relating to H.R. 2608 on March 9, 2023. On April
26, 2023, the Committee on Financial Services ordered H.R. 2608
to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives by a vote

referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs.

duced H.R.3343, the Greenlighting Growth Act, with Representa-
tive Ann Wagner (R–MO) as an original cosponsor. The bill was re-
ferred solely to the Committee on Financial Services. The bill was
attached to the February 26, 2025, hearing titled ‘‘The Future of
American Capital: Strengthening Public and Private Markets by
Increasing Investor Access and Facilitating Capital Formation’’ and
the March 25, 2025, hearing titled, ‘‘Beyond Silicon Valley: Ex-
panding Access to Capital Across America.’’
On May 20, 2025, the Committee met in open session to consider,
among others, H.R. 3343. The Committee ordered H.R. 3343, as
amended, to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives.

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS
Pursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, the findings and recommendations of the Com-
mittee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in
the descriptive portions of this report.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the goal of H.R. 3343 is to establish that an
Emerging Growth Company (EGC), as well as any issuer that went
public using EGC disclosure obligations, only needs to provide two
years of audited financial statements.
COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE
Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives requires an estimate and a comparison of the costs
that would be incurred in carrying out H.R. 3343. The Committee
has requested but not received a cost estimate from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office. However, pursuant to clause
3(d)(1) of rule XIII, the Committee will adopt as its own the cost
estimate by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office once
it has been prepared.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND CBO COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements
of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a
cost estimate was not made available to the Committee in time for
the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall
cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon
its receipt by the Committee.
UNFUNDED MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee has requested but not received from the Director
of the Congressional Budget Office an estimate of the Federal man-
dates pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act. The Committee will adopt the estimate once it has been pre-
pared by the Director.
EARMARK STATEMENT
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the pro-
visions of the resolution and states that the provisions of the bill
do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or
limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule.
FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.

APPLICABILITY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to the
terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee states that no provision of the
bill establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal Govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, includ-
ing any program that was included in a report to Congress pursu-
ant to section 21 of the Public Law 111–139 or the most recent
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1. Short title
This section provides that the Act may be cited as the
‘‘Greenlighting Growth Act.’’

Act of 1934 to state that an Emerging Growth Company (EGC), as
well as any issuer that went public using EGC disclosure obliga-
tions, does not need to provide financial statements or acquired
company financial statements for any period prior to the earliest
audited period the EGC provided in connection with its initial pub-
lic offering.

INFORMATION REQUIRED IN REGISTRATION STATEMENT

(a) INFORMATION REQUIRED IN REGISTRATION STATEMENT.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The registration statement, when relating
to a security other than a security issued by a foreign govern-
ment, or political subdivision thereof, shall contain the infor-
mation, and be accompanied by the documents, specified in
Schedule A, and when relating to a security issued by a foreign
government, or political subdivision thereof, shall contain the

information, and be accompanied by the documents, specified
in Schedule B; except that the Commission may by rules or
regulations provide that any such information or document
need not be included in respect of any class of issuers or secu-
rities if it finds that the requirement of such information or
document is inapplicable to such class and that disclosure fully
adequate for the protection of investors is otherwise required
to be included within the registration statement. If any ac-
countant, engineer, or appraiser, or any person whose profes-
sion gives authority to a statement made by him, is named as
having prepared or certified any part of the registration state-
ment, or is named as having prepared or certified a report or
valuation for use in connection with the registration statement,
the written consent of such person shall be filed with the reg-
istration statement. If any such person is named as having
prepared or certified a report or valuation (other than a public
official document or statement) which is used in connection
with the registration statement, but is not named as having
prepared or certified such report or valuation for use in connec-
tion with the registration statement, the written consent of
such person shall be filed with the registration statement un-
less the Commission dispenses with such filing as impracti-
cable or as involving undue hardship on the person filing the
registration statement. Any such registration statement shall
contain such other information, and be accompanied by such
other documents, as the Commission may by rules or regula-
tions require as being necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.
(2) TREATMENT OF EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES.—An
emerging growth company—
(A) need not present more than 2 years of audited finan-
cial statements in order for the registration statement of
such emerging growth company with respect to an initial
public offering of its common equity securities to be effec-
tive, and in any other registration statement to be filed
with the Commission, an emerging growth company need
not present selected financial data in accordance with sec-
tion 229.301 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, for
any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in
connection with its initial public offering; øand¿
(B) need not present acquired company financial state-
ments or information otherwise required under section
210.3–05 or section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal
Regulations, or any successor thereto, for any period prior
to the earliest audited period of the emerging growth com-
pany presented in connection with its initial public offering
and, thereafter, in no event shall an issuer that was an
emerging growth company but is no longer an emerging
growth company be required to present financial statements
of the issuer (or acquired company financial statements or
information otherwise required under section 210.3–05 or
section 210.8–04 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or
any successor thereto) for any period prior to the earliest
audited period of the emerging growth company presented
in connection with its initial public offering; and

ø(B)¿ (C) may not be required to comply with any new
or revised financial accounting standard until such date
that a company that is not an issuer (as defined under sec-
tion 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C.
7201(a))) is required to comply with such new or revised
accounting standard, if such standard applies to companies
that are not issuers.
(b)(1) The Commission shall prescribe special rules with respect
to registration statements filed by any issuer that is a blank check
company. Such rules may, as the Commission determines nec-
essary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors—
(A) require such issuers to provide timely disclosure, prior to
or after such statement becomes effective under section 8, of (i)
information regarding the company to be acquired and the spe-
cific application of the proceeds of the offering, or (ii) additional
information necessary to prevent such statement from being
misleading;
(B) place limitations on the use of such proceeds and the dis-
tribution of securities by such issuer until the disclosures re-
quired under subparagraph (A) have been made; and
(C) provide a right of rescission to shareholders of such secu-
rities.
(2) The Commission may, as it determines consistent with the
public interest and the protection of investors, by rule or order ex-
empt any issuer or class of issuers from the rules prescribed under
paragraph (1).
(3) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term
‘‘blank check company’’ means any development stage company
that is issuing a penny stock (within the meaning of section
3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and that—
(A) has no specific business plan or purpose; or
(B) has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an
unidentified company or companies.
(c) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall adopt regulations
under this subsection requiring each issuer of an asset-backed
security to disclose, for each tranche or class of security, infor-
mation regarding the assets backing that security.
(2) CONTENT OF REGULATIONS.—In adopting regulations
under this subsection, the Commission shall—
(A) set standards for the format of the data provided by
issuers of an asset-backed security, which shall, to the ex-
tent feasible, facilitate comparison of such data across se-
curities in similar types of asset classes; and
(B) require issuers of asset-backed securities, at a min-
imum, to disclose asset-level or loan-level data, if such
data are necessary for investors to independently perform
due diligence, including—
(i) data having unique identifiers relating to loan
brokers or originators;
(ii) the nature and extent of the compensation of the
broker or originator of the assets backing the security;
and

(iii) the amount of risk retention by the originator
and the securitizer of such assets.
(3) DATA STANDARDS FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES DISCLO-
SURES.—
(A) REQUIREMENT.—The Commission shall, by rule,
adopt data standards for all disclosures required under
this subsection.
(B) CONSISTENCY.—The data standards required under
subparagraph (A) shall incorporate, and ensure compat-
ibility with (to the extent feasible), all applicable data
standards established in the rules promulgated under sec-
tion 124 of the Financial Stability Act of 2010, including,
to the extent practicable, by having the characteristics de-
scribed in clauses (i) through (vi) of subsection (c)(1)(B) of
such section 124.
(d) REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.—
Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this sub-
section, the Commission shall issue rules relating to the registra-
tion statement required to be filed by any issuer of an asset-backed
security (as that term is defined in section 3(a)(77) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that require any issuer of an asset-backed
security—
(1) to perform a review of the assets underlying the asset-
backed security; and
(2) to disclose the nature of the review under paragraph (1).

REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITIES
SEC. 12. (a) It shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or deal-
er to effect any transaction in any security (other than an exempt-
ed security) on a national securities exchange unless a registration

under. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in respect
of a security futures product traded on a national securities ex-
change.
(b) A security may be registered on a national securities ex-
change by the issuer filing an application with the exchange (and
filing with the Commission such duplicate originals thereof as the
Commission may require), which application shall contain—
(1) Such information, in such detail, as to the issuer and any
person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or
under direct or indirect common control with, the issuer, and
any guarantor of the security as to principal or interest or
both, as the Commission may by rules and regulations require,

curities exchange, subject to subparagraph (B); and
(ii) any security that is otherwise registered pursuant to this

(B) A national securities exchange may not extend unlisted trad-
ing privileges to a security described in subparagraph (A)(i) during
such interval, if any, after the commencement of an initial public
offering of such security, as is or may be required pursuant to sub-
paragraph (C).
(C) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the
Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994, the Commission shall pre-
scribe, by rule or regulation, the duration of the interval referred
to in subparagraph (B), if any, as the Commission determines to be
necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets, the protection of investors and the public interest, or oth-
erwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. Until the earlier
of the effective date of such rule or regulation or 240 days after
such date of enactment, such interval shall begin at the opening of
trading on the day on which such security commences trading on
the national securities exchange with which such security is reg-
istered and end at the conclusion of the next day of trading.
(D) The Commission may prescribe, by rule or regulation such
additional procedures or requirements for extending unlisted trad-
ing privileges to any security as the Commission deems necessary
or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the
protection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(E) No extension of unlisted trading privileges to securities de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(ii) may occur except pursuant to a
rule, regulation, or order of the Commission approving such exten-
sion or extensions. In promulgating such rule or regulation or in
issuing such order, the Commission—
(i) shall find that such extension or extensions of unlisted
trading privileges is consistent with the maintenance of fair
and orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public
interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this
title;
(ii) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
securities, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such securities, and the de-
sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(iii) shall not permit a national securities exchange to extend
unlisted trading privileges to such securities if any rule of such
national securities exchange would unreasonably impair the
ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such secu-
rities for its own account, or would unreasonably restrict com-
petition among dealers in such securities or between such deal-
ers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists
and such dealers who are not specialists.
(F) An exchange may continue to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges in accordance with this paragraph only if the exchange and
the subject security continue to satisfy the requirements for eligi-
bility under this paragraph, including any rules and regulations
issued by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph, except that
unlisted trading privileges may continue with regard to securities
which had been admitted on such exchange prior to July 1, 1964,
notwithstanding the failure to satisfy such requirements. If un-

listed trading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to
this subparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that secu-
rity, unless the exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.
(G) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) a security is the subject of an initial public offering if—
(I) the offering of the subject security is registered under
the Securities Act of 1933; and
(II) the issuer of the security, immediately prior to filing
the registration statement with respect to the offering, was
not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or
15(d) of this title; and
(ii) an initial public offering of such security commences at
the opening of trading on the day on which such security com-
mences trading on the national securities exchange with which
such security is registered.
(2)(A) At any time within 60 days of commencement of trading
on an exchange of a security pursuant to unlisted trading privi-
leges, the Commission may summarily suspend such unlisted trad-
ing privileges on the exchange. Such suspension shall not be re-
viewable under section 25 of this title and shall not be deemed to
be a final agency action for purposes of section 704 of title 5,
United States Code. Upon such suspension—
(i) the exchange shall cease trading in the security by the
close of business on the date of such suspension, or at such
time as the Commission may prescribe by rule or order for the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of this title; and
(ii) if the exchange seeks to extend unlisted trading privi-
leges to the security, the exchange shall file an application to
reinstate its ability to do so with the Commission pursuant to
such procedures as the Commission may prescribe by rule or
order for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the pro-
tection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in fur-
therance of the purposes of this title.
(B) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect
until the Commission, by order, grants approval of an application
to reinstate, as described in subparagraph (A)(ii).
(C) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall not affect the va-
lidity or force of an extension of unlisted trading privileges in effect
prior to such suspension.
(D) The Commission shall not approve an application by a na-
tional securities exchange to reinstate its ability to extend unlisted
trading privileges to a security unless the Commission finds, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that the extension of unlisted
trading privileges pursuant to such application is consistent with
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of in-
vestors and the public interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of this title. If the application is made to reinstate un-
listed trading privileges to a security described in paragraph
(1)(A)(ii), the Commission—
(i) shall take account of the public trading activity in such
security, the character of such trading, the impact of such ex-
tension on the existing markets for such a security, and the de-

sirability of removing impediments to and the progress that
has been made toward the development of a national market
system; and
(ii) shall not grant any such application if any rule of the na-
tional securities exchange making application under this sub-
section would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to so-
licit or effect transactions in such security for its own account,
or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers in
such security or between such dealers acting in the capacity of
marketmakers who are specialists and such dealers who are
not specialists.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the Commission shall by
rules and regulations suspend unlisted trading privileges in whole
or in part for any or all classes of securities for a period not exceed-
ing twelve months, if it deems such suspension necessary or appro-
priate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or to
prevent evasion of the purposes of this title.
(4) On the application of the issuer of any security for which un-
listed trading privileges on any exchange have been continued or
extended pursuant to this subsection, or of any broker or dealer
who makes or creates a market for such security, or of any other
person having a bona fide interest in the question of termination
or suspension of such unlisted trading privileges, or on its own mo-
tion, the Commission shall by order terminate, or suspend for a pe-
riod not exceeding twelve months, such unlisted trading privileges
for such security if the Commission finds, after appropriate notice
and opportunity for hearing, that such termination or suspension
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protec-
tion of investors.
(5) In any proceeding under this subsection in which appropriate
notice and opportunity for hearing are required, notice of not less
than ten days to the applicant in such proceeding, to the issuer of
the security involved, to the exchange which is seeking to continue
or extend or has continued or extended unlisted trading privileges
for such security, and to the exchange, if any, on which such secu-
rity is listed and registered, shall be deemed adequate notice, and
any broker or dealer who makes or creates a market for such secu-
rity, and any other person having a bona fide interest in such pro-
ceeding, shall upon application be entitled to be heard.
(6) Any security for which unlisted trading privileges are contin-
ued or extended pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to be
registered on a national securities exchange within the meaning of
this title. The powers and duties of the Commission under this title
shall be applicable to the rules of an exchange in respect to any
such security. The Commission may, by such rules and regulations
as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors, either unconditionally or upon specified
terms and conditions, or for stated periods, exempt such securities
from the operation of any provision of section 13, 14, or 16 of this
title.

in a business affecting interstate commerce, or whose securities are

empted security) held of record by either—
(i) 2,000 persons, or
(ii) 500 persons who are not accredited investors (as such
term is defined by the Commission), and

day of its first fiscal year ended after the effective date of this
subsection, on which the issuer has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of equity security (other than an ex-
empted security) held of record by 2,000 or more persons,
register such security by filing with the Commission a registration
statement (and such copies thereof as the Commission may require)
with respect to such security containing such information and docu-
ments as the Commission may specify comparable to that which is
required in an application to register a security pursuant to sub-
section (b) of this section. Each such registration statement shall
become effective sixty days after filing with the Commission or
within such shorter period as the Commission may direct. Until
such registration statement becomes effective it shall not be
deemed filed for the purposes of section 18 of this title. Any issuer
may register any class of equity security not required to be reg-
istered by filing a registration statement pursuant to the provisions
of this paragraph. The Commission is authorized to extend the date
upon which any issuer or class of issuers is required to register a
security pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in respect
of—
(A) any security listed and registered on a national securities
exchange.

associations, if such federation possesses no greater powers or
purposes than cooperative associations so defined.
(F) any security issued by a mutual or cooperative organiza-
tion which supplies a commodity or service primarily for the
benefit of its members and operates not for pecuniary profit,

following conditions are met:
(i) Such insurance company is required to and does file
an annual statement with the Commissioner of Insurance
(or other officer or agency performing a similar function)
of its domiciliary State, and such annual statement con-
forms to that prescribed by the National Association of In-
surance Commissioners or in the determination of such
State commissioner, officer or agency substantially con-
forms to that so prescribed.
(ii) Such insurance company is subject to regulation by
its domiciliary State of proxies, consents, or authorizations
in respect of securities issued by such company and such
regulation conforms to that prescribed by the National As-
sociation of Insurance Commissioners.
(iii) After July 1, 1966, the purchase and sales of securi-
ties issued by such insurance company by beneficial own-
ers, directors, or officers of such company are subject to
regulation (including reporting) by its domiciliary State
substantially in the manner provided in section 16 of this
title.
(H) any interest or participation in any collective trust funds
maintained by a bank or in a separate account maintained by
an insurance company which interest or participation is issued

tion 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, (ii) an annuity

motion, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by order, exempt
from this subsection any security of a foreign issuer, including any
certificate of deposit for such a security, if the Commission finds
that such exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with
the protection of investors.

section shall be terminated ninety days, or such shorter period as
the Commission may determine, after the issuer files a certification
with the Commission that the number of holders of record of such

Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), 1,200 persons persons. The
Commission shall after notice and opportunity for hearing deny ter-
mination of registration if it finds that the certification is untrue.
Termination of registration shall be deferred pending final deter-
mination on the question of denial.
(5) For the purposes of this subsection the term ‘‘class’’ shall in-
clude all securities of an issuer which are of substantially similar
character and the holders of which enjoy substantially similar
rights and privileges. The Commission may for the purpose of this
subsection define by rules and regulations the terms ‘‘total assets’’
and ‘‘held of record’’ as it deems necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors in order to prevent
circumvention of the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of
this subsection, a security futures product shall not be considered
a class of equity security of the issuer of the securities underlying
the security futures product. For purposes of determining whether
an issuer is required to register a security with the Commission
pursuant to paragraph (1), the definition of ‘‘held of record’’ shall
not include securities held by persons who received the securities
pursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions ex-
empted from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Secu-
rities Act of 1933.
(6) EXCLUSION FOR PERSONS HOLDING CERTAIN SECURITIES.—

ditionally, securities acquired pursuant to an offering made
under section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933 from the provi-
sions of this subsection.
(h) The Commission may by rules and regulations, or upon appli-
cation of an interested person, by order, after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, exempt in whole or in part any issuer or class
of issuers from the provisions of subsection (g) of this section or
from section 13, 14, or 15(d) or may exempt from section 16 any
officer, director, or beneficial owner of securities of any issuer, any
security of which is required to be registered pursuant to sub-
section (g) hereof, upon such terms and conditions and for such pe-
riod as it deems necessary or appropriate, if the Commission finds,
by reason of the number of public investors, amount of trading in-
terest in the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of
the issuer, income or assets of the issuer, or otherwise, that such
action is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection
of investors. The Commission may, for the purposes of any of the
above-mentioned sections or subsections of this title, classify
issuers and prescribe requirements appropriate for each such class.

ciations the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the powers, functions, and duties

are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are
vested in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Comp-
troller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
serve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall
have the power to make such rules and regulations as may be nec-
essary for the execution of the functions vested in them as provided
in this subsection. In carrying out their responsibilities under this
subsection, the agencies named in the first sentence of this sub-
section shall issue substantially similar regulations to regulations
and rules issued by the Commission under sections 10A(m), 12, 13,
14(a), 14(c), 14(d), 14(f) and 16 of this Act, and sections 302, 303,
304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, unless they find that implementation of substantially similar
regulations with respect to insured banks and insured institutions
are not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for protec-
tion of investors, and publish such findings, and the detailed rea-
sons therefor, in the Federal Register. Such regulations of the
above-named agencies, or the reasons for failure to publish such
substantially similar regulations to those of the Commission, shall
be published in the Federal Register within 120 days of the date
of enactment of this subsection, and, thereafter, within 60 days of
any changes made by the Commission in its relevant regulations
and rules.
(j) The Commission is authorized, by order, as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors to deny, to suspend
the effective date of, to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve
months, or to revoke the registration of a security, if the Commis-
sion finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of such security has failed to comply with any provi-
sion of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder. No mem-
ber of a national securities exchange, broker, or dealer shall make
use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate com-
merce to effect any transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale
of, any security the registration of which has been and is sus-
pended or revoked pursuant to the preceding sentence.
(k) TRADING SUSPENSIONS; EMERGENCY AUTHORITY.—
(1) TRADING SUSPENSIONS.—If in its opinion the public inter-
est and the protection of investors so require, the Commission
is authorized by order—
(A) summarily to suspend trading in any security (other
than an exempted security) for a period not exceeding 10
business days, and
(B) summarily to suspend all trading on any national se-
curities exchange or otherwise, in securities other than ex-
empted securities, for a period not exceeding 90 calendar
days.
The action described in subparagraph (B) shall not take effect
unless the Commission notifies the President of its decision
and the President notifies the Commission that the President
does not disapprove of such decision. If the actions described
in subparagraph (A) or (B) involve a security futures product,

any security in contravention of an order of the Commission
under this subsection unless such order has been stayed, modi-
fied, or set aside as provided in paragraph (5) of this sub-
section or has ceased to be effective upon direction of the Presi-
dent as provided in paragraph (3).
(5) LIMITATIONS ON REVIEW OF ORDERS.—An order of the
Commission pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to re-

be based on an examination of all the information before the
Commission at the time such order was issued. The reviewing
court shall not enter a stay, writ of mandamus, or similar re-
lief unless the court finds, after notice and hearing before a
panel of the court, that the Commission’s action is arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord-
ance with law.
(6) CONSULTATION.—Prior to taking any action described in
paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall consult with and con-
sider the views of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, unless such consultation is im-
practicable in light of the emergency.

prices generally, or a substantial threat thereof, that
threaten fair and orderly markets; or
(ii) a substantial disruption of the safe or efficient
operation of the national system for clearance and set-
tlement of transactions in securities, or a substantial
threat thereof; or
(B) a major disturbance that substantially disrupts, or
threatens to substantially disrupt—
(i) the functioning of securities markets, investment
companies, or any other significant portion or segment
of the securities markets; or

is registered pursuant to this section or would be required to be so
registered except for the exemption from registration provided by
subsection (g)(2)(B) or (g)(2)(G) of this section, by the use of any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails,
to issue, either originally or upon transfer, any of such securities
in a form or with a format which contravenes such rules and regu-
lations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appro-
priate for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of
transactions in securities. The provisions of this subsection shall
not apply to variable annuity contracts or variable life policies
issued by an insurance company or its separate accounts.
