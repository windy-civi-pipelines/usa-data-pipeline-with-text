PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 1969, the ‘‘No Wrong Door for Veterans Act,’’ was intro-
duced by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa on March 10,
2025. This bill would reauthorize the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs (VA) Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention
Grant Program through fiscal year (FY) 2026 and authorize
$54,500,000 in appropriations to carry out the mental health care
support services grant program and would mandate the use of the
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, expand provider eligibility,
and require improved coordination between VA Medical Centers
and mental health care organization grantees. The bill also author-
izes emergency community mental health care support for veterans
in crisis if the local VA facility cannot deliver such services within
72 hours.
Additionally, H.R. 1969, as amended, includes the text of H.R.
1971, the Veterans Supporting Prosthetics Opportunities and Rec-
reational Therapy (SPORT) Act, which would expand prosthetic
coverage for veterans who wish to obtain prosthetics for adaptive
athletic use. The bill, as amended, would also provide an offset for
the cost of this bill by extending current law restricting the amount
of pension paid to VA pension beneficiaries who are admitted to a
VA or Medicaid sponsored nursing facility.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short Title
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Wrong Door for Veterans Act.’’
Section 2: Amendments to and reauthorization of the Staff Sergeant
Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program of the
Department of Veterans Affairs
The Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant
Program (Fox Grant Program) was authorized by the passage of
the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care
Improvement Act of 2019 [P.L. 116–171]. The program’s purpose is
to provide community-based mental health organizations with
grant funding to increase veterans’ access to mental health care,
support, and suicide prevention services in their communities
across the United States through public-private partnerships.
Suicidality among veterans is a serious problem. According to
VA’s 2024 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report,
there were roughly 17.6 veteran suicides per day. The same report
suggests that out of those 17.6 veterans, 6.7 of them (38%) were
being treated through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
Among those who used VHA, almost 4 in 10 veterans (39.1%) were
not being treated for a mental health or substance use disorder.
This suggests that a considerable number of veterans lost to sui-
cide had not received care or been diagnosed with a mental health
disorder by VA specifically prior to their death. This situation can
potentially be remedied by providing easier access to mental health
care through private providers and organizations.
Through the Fox Grant Program, VA’s ability to provide mental
health services has expanded, and it has connected veterans with
traditional and non-traditional care and treatment that meet their
needs. As of September 2023, hundreds of grantees have completed

over 20,000 outreach contacts to veterans. However, under current
law, this pilot program will expire at the end of fiscal year 2025.
The results of the Fox Grant Program are difficult to quantify,
but the 2024 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report
suggests that suicide rates among veterans who receive mental
health treatment decrease by 39.77%. Consequently, getting vet-
erans the mental health care they need must remain a priority.
The Committee staff believes that reauthorizing the Fox Grant
Program through fiscal year 2026 will ensure continued efforts to
secure critical care for at-risk veterans—ensuring that mental
health care needs are met, and that veterans are able to receive
community-based emergency mental health if VA is unable to pro-
vide such care within 72 hours of first contact.
Section 3: Inclusion of Adaptive Prostheses and Terminal Devices
for Sports and Other Recreational Activities in Medical Services
Furnished to Eligible Veterans by the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs
The bill also includes the text of H.R. 1971, the Veterans Sup-
porting Prosthetics Opportunities and Recreational Therapy
(SPORT) Act. This bill was introduced in response to how VA
health plans have routinely denied access to O&P care for physical
activities as ‘‘not medically necessary.’’ This section would provide
coverage under the Department of Veterans Affairs benefit for
prosthetic limbs that veterans with limb loss use to participate in
sports and other recreational activities. As studies show, veterans
living with limb loss who engage in organized recreational activi-
ties are less likely to suffer from mental health disorders such as
depression, anxiety, and stress. Committee staff consider this
change in law to be beneficial to veterans’ overall mental health
care.
Section 4: Extension of Certain Limits on Payments of Pension
Under current law (38 U.S.C. §5503(d)), the amount of VA pen-
sion paid to veterans having no spouse nor child, veterans’ sur-
viving spouses having no child, and veterans’ children who are ad-
mitted to a VA or Medicaid sponsored nursing facility is capped at
$90 a month. This section would cover the costs of the other sec-
tions of this bill by extending this pension limitation by fourteen
months to January 30, 2033. Because they receive government
sponsored care in a nursing home, these pension beneficiaries do
not require the full amount of pension to cover their cost of living.
The Committee believes this short-term extension of the current
limit on pension payments is a reasonable way to cover the costs
associated with the other sections of this bill.

SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On March 25, 2025, the Subcommittee on Health met in an open
markup session, a quorum being present, to consider H.R. 1969.
Representative Miller-Meeks offered an amendment in the nature
of a substitute, which would extend the program through 2026;
clarify the interplay with other emergent suicide prevention au-
thorities; and mandate the use of the Columbia-Suicide Severity
Rating Scale, which is a screening tool. This amendment was
adopted by a recorded vote of 7 yeas, 5 noes. A motion by Rep-
resentative Van Orden of Wisconsin to order H.R. 1969, as amend-
ed, favorably forwarded to the full Committee on Veterans Affairs
was agreed to by voice vote.
COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
On May 6, 2025, the full Committee met in an open markup ses-
sion, to consider H.R. 1969, as amended. During consideration of
the bill, the following amendments were considered:
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute
to H.R. 1969 was offered by Representative Miller-Meeks, which
would offset the costs of the bill and include the text of H.R. 1971,
the Veterans SPORT Act, ensuring the availability of adaptive
sports or recreation prosthetic limbs, including artificial hand ‘‘ter-
minal devices,’’ by recognizing them as clinically necessary for vet-
erans suffering from limb loss. This amendment to the amendment
in the nature of a substitute was agreed to by voice vote.

A substitute amendment to the amendment in the nature of a
substitute was offered by Representative Ramirez. This substitute
amendment, in the nature of a substitute, would strip out Chair-
woman Miller-Meeks’ ANS entirely, increasing the maximum grant
amount from $750,000 to $1,250,000. This amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute would also reauthorize the program to 2028.
This substitute amendment to the amendment in the nature of a
substitute failed by a recorded vote of 11 ayes, 13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute
to H.R. 1969 was offered by Representative Budzinski. This amend-
ment would require grant recipients to prioritize suicide services
for veterans who have experienced job loss or unemployment due
to the economic turmoil occurring since January 20, 2025. This
amendment failed by a recorded vote of 11 ayes, 13 noes.
An amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute
to H.R. 1969 was offered by Ranking Member Takano. This amend-
ment would require grant recipients to ensure that end users re-
ceive a post-intervention mental health assessment using a mental
health screening tool, which tool must be the same tool used to con-
duct the baseline mental health screening for the end user. This
amendment failed by voice vote.
A motion by Rep. Bergman of Michigan to report H.R. 1969, as
amended, favorably to the House of Representatives, was agreed to
by voice vote.
COMMITTEE VOTES
In compliance with clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, two recorded votes were taken on
amendments or in connection with ordering H.R. 1969, as amend-
ed, reported to the House.

• Extend the reduction of pensions the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs pays to veterans and survivors residing in Med-
icaid nursing homes
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
• Authorizing appropriations of $53 million for 2026 for the
suicide prevention program
• Reducing pension payments
Bill summary: H.R. 1969 would extend the Staff Sergeant Parker
Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program administered by the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through fiscal year 2026 and
authorize appropriations for that purpose. The bill also would clar-
ify that VA may provide adaptive prosthetic devices for sports and
recreational activities as a medical service. Finally, the bill would
extend a temporary limitation on certain pension payments
through January 2033.
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated budgetary effects of H.R.
1969 are shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within
budget functions 550 (health) and 700 (veterans benefits and serv-
ices).

Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R.
1969 will be enacted in fiscal year 2025 and that outlays will follow
historical spending patterns for affected programs.
Provisions that affect spending subject to appropriation and di-
rect spending: Section 2 of the bill would reauthorize the Staff Ser-
geant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program
through fiscal year 2026 and authorize the appropriation of $53
million for that year. The program makes grants to community or-
ganizations that provide suicide prevention services to at-risk vet-
erans.
CBO expects that some of the costs of implementing the bill
would be paid from the Toxic Exposures Fund (TEF) established by
Public Law 117–168, the Honoring our PACT Act. The TEF is a
mandatory appropriation that VA uses to pay for health care, dis-
ability claims processing, medical research, and IT modernization
that benefit veterans who were exposed to environmental hazards.
Additional spending from the TEF would occur if legislation in-
creases the costs of similar activities that benefit veterans with
such exposure. CBO estimates that 19 percent of such additional
funding would come from the TEF in 2026. That percentage is
based on the amount of formerly discretionary appropriations that
CBO projects will be provided through the mandatory appropria-

tion as specified in the Honoring our PACT Act.1 CBO estimates
that over the 2025–2035 period, implementing section 2 would in-
crease spending subject to appropriation by $43 million and direct
spending by $10 million.
Direct spending: In addition to expanding benefits that would
partly be covered by the TEF, CBO estimates that enacting the bill
would affect direct spending by reducing pension payments to vet-
erans and survivors who reside in Medicaid nursing homes. In
total, the bill would decrease net direct spending by $46 million
over the 2025–2035 period.
Under current law, VA reduces pension payments to veterans
and survivors who reside in Medicaid nursing homes to $90 per
month. That required reduction expires November 30, 2031. Sec-
tion 4 would extend that reduction for 14 months, through January
31, 2033. CBO estimates that extending that requirement would
reduce VA benefits by $10 million per month. (Those benefits are
paid from mandatory appropriations and are therefore considered
direct spending.) As a result of that reduction in beneficiaries’ in-
come, Medicaid would pay more of the cost of their care, increasing
spending for that program by $6 million per month. Thus, enacting
section 4 would reduce net direct spending by $56 million over the
2025–2035 period.
Spending subject to appropriation: The discussion above in ‘‘Pro-
visions That Affect Spending Subject to Appropriation and Direct
Spending’’ describes the authorization of appropriations for suicide
prevention grants. That authorization would increase spending
subject to appropriation by $43 million over the 2025–2035 period.
Section 3 would clarify that adaptive prostheses and terminal de-
vices for sports and other recreational activities are included in the
definition of medical services furnished to veterans. VA currently
provides those types of adaptive devices; thus, CBO estimates that
implementing section 3 would not affect the federal budget.
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act
of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures
for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net
changes in outlays that are subject to those pay-as-you-go proce-
dures are shown in Table 1.
Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO esti-
mates that enacting H.R. 1969 would not increase net direct spend-
ing or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year peri-
ods beginning in 2036.
Mandates: The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sec-
tor mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Noah Callahan (for vet-
erans health care); Logan Smith (for pensions); Mandates: Brandon
Lever.
Estimate reviewed by: David Newman, Chief, Defense, Inter-
national Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs Cost Estimates Unit; Kath-
leen FitzGerald, Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit; Chris-
tina Hawley Anthony, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.
Estimate approved by: Phillip L. Swagel, Director, Congressional
Budget Office.

Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
1969, as amended, establishes or reauthorizes a program of the
Federal Government known to be duplicative of another Federal
program, a program that was included in any report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21
of Public Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identi-
fied in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION
Section 1: Short title
This section would establish the short title as the ‘‘No Wrong
Door for Veterans Act’’.
Section 2: Reauthorization and improvement of the Staff Sergeant
Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program of the
Department of Veterans Affairs
Section 2(a) would extend the authorization of the Fox Suicide
Prevention Grant Program through September 30, 2026. This re-
places the original sunset clause, which tied the program’s expira-
tion to a date three years after the first grant was issued.
Section 2(b) would amend subsection (m) to require grantees to
notify eligible veterans that they may qualify for emergent suicide
care under 38 U.S.C. §1720J and, if the veteran elects to receive
that care, notify the VA Secretary. Additionally, this would amend
subsection (n) to require VA to respond within 72 hours of a refer-
ral. If VA does not provide care within that window, the veteran
will be automatically eligible for emergent suicide care under
§1720J.
Section 2(c) would authorize $52,500,000 in appropriations for
fiscal year 2026.
Section 2(d) would modify eligibility criteria for grantees by re-
quiring that an entity must have provided mental health care or
support services continuously in the United States for at least two

years prior to applying. Additionally, it would expand eligible enti-
ty types to explicitly include health care providers.
Section 2(e) would clarify the term ‘‘emergency treatment’’ by
amending the existing language to read: ‘‘The term ‘emergency
treatment’ means medical services’’.
Section 2(f) would mandate that all grants awarded after enact-
ment must use the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C–
SSRS) as the standardized screening tool for suicide risk assess-
ment.
Section 3: Inclusion of adaptive prostheses and terminal devices for
recreational activities
This section would amend 38 U.S.C. §1701(6)(F)(i) to authorize
VA to provide adaptive prosthetic limbs and terminal devices used
by veterans to participate in sports and other recreational activi-
ties.
Section 4: Extension of certain limits on payments of pension
This section would extend the termination date of limitations on
VA pension payments to institutionalized beneficiaries by amend-
ing 38 U.S.C. §5503(d)(7), changing the expiration from November
30, 2031, to January 30, 2033.

stitutionalized veterans
(a)(1)(A) Where any veteran having neither spouse nor child is
being furnished domiciliary care by the Department, no pension in
excess of $90 per month shall be paid to or for the veteran for any
period after the end of the third full calendar month following the
month of admission for such care.
(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph,
where any veteran having neither spouse nor child is being fur-
nished nursing home care by the Department, no pension in excess
of $90 per month shall be paid to or for the veteran for any period
after the end of the third full calendar month following the month
of admission for such care. Any amount in excess of $90 per month
to which the veteran would be entitled but for the application of
the preceding sentence shall be deposited in a revolving fund at the
Department medical facility which furnished the veteran nursing
care, and such amount shall be available for obligation without fis-
cal year limitation to help defray operating expenses of that facil-
ity.
(C) No pension in excess of $90 per month shall be paid to or for
a veteran having neither spouse nor child for any period after the
month in which such veteran is readmitted for care described in
subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph and furnished by the De-
partment if such veteran is readmitted within six months of a pe-
riod of care in connection with which pension was reduced pursu-
ant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph.
(D) In the case of a veteran being furnished nursing home care
by the Department and with respect to whom subparagraph (B) of
this paragraph requires a reduction in pension, such reduction
shall not be made for a period of up to three additional calendar
months after the last day of the third month referred to in such
subparagraph if the Secretary determines that the primary purpose
for the furnishing of such care during such additional period is for
the Department to provide such veteran with a prescribed program
of rehabilitation services, under chapter 17 of this title, designed
to restore such veteran’s ability to function within such veteran’s
family and community. If the Secretary determines that it is nec-
essary, after such period, for the veteran to continue such program
of rehabilitation services in order to achieve the purposes of such
program and that the primary purpose of furnishing nursing home
care to the veteran continues to be the provision of such program
to the veteran, the reduction in pension required by subparagraph
(B) of this paragraph shall not be made for the number of calendar
months that the Secretary determines is necessary for the veteran
to achieve the purposes of such program.

the amount payable to the veteran while being furnished such care
which would be payable to the veteran if pension were payable

other provision of law, no reduction shall be made in the pension
of any veteran for any part of the period during which the veteran
is furnished hospital treatment, or institutional or domiciliary care,
for Hansen’s disease, by the United States or any political subdivi-
sion thereof.
(c) Where any veteran in receipt of an aid and attendance allow-
ance described in subsection (r) or (t) of section 1114 of this title
is hospitalized at Government expense, such allowance shall be dis-
continued from the first day of the second calendar month which
begins after the date of the veteran’s admission for such hos-
pitalization for so long as such hospitalization continues. Any dis-
continuance required by administrative regulation, during hos-
pitalization of a veteran by the Department, of increased pension
based on need of regular aid and attendance or additional com-
pensation based on need of regular aid and attendance as described
in subsection (l) or (m) of section 1114 of this title, shall not be ef-
fective earlier than the first day of the second calendar month
which begins after the date of the veteran’s admission for hos-
pitalization. In case a veteran affected by this subsection leaves a
hospital against medical advice and is thereafter admitted to hos-
pitalization within six months from the date of such departure,

MINORITY VIEWS
The amendment in the nature of a substitute (A.N.S.) to the No
Wrong Door for Veterans Act (H.R. 1969), as amended, reauthor-
izes the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention
Grant Program for one year and makes additional changes.
While Democratic members appreciate the importance of the
Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention grant pro-
gram in VA’s overall suicide prevention strategy and generally sup-
port reauthorizing the program, we want to ensure that it is reau-
thorized a way that ensures it is as effective and robust as possible.
We are concerned that this bill, as amended and reported by the
Committee, will not meet that goal.
First, based on the two congressionally mandated reports that
VA has so far provided to the Committee, the Fox grant program
has not been implemented in a way that enables VA and Congress
to evaluate its overall effectiveness. VA has not established enough
metrics to monitor the success of the program. Further, grantees
are not collecting or reporting complete data for all participants,
which limits Congress’s ability to determine whether this grant
program is meeting its intended purposes. H.R. 1969 does not take
steps to address these concerns, and in fact includes provisions that
would further limit the collection of robust, complete data from
grantees.
This bill would also require grantees to use the Columbia Suicide
Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) to screen participants for their
baseline mental health when entering the program. While this tool
is a widely accepted, clinically validated behavioral health screen-
ing instrument, its primary use is to measure a patient’s suicidal
ideation and the severity of suicidal risk at a given point in time.
As the Fox grant program is currently implemented, grantees have
the option to screen participants’ baseline mental health with the
following screening tools: Patient Health Questionnaire, General
Self-Efficacy Scale, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Socio
Economic Status, and the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being
Scale. These other instruments measure the degree of depression
a patient is experiencing; their levels of emotion, optimism, and
work satisfaction; and their perceptions of social support. Since the
Fox grant program is intended to address ‘‘upstream’’ factors of
mental health that contribute to veterans’ suicide risk, it seems
that the CSSRS would be the least useful tool for measuring the
program’s effectiveness, as it assesses acute suicidality. Limiting
grantees to the use of a single screening instrument that measures
suicide risk at a point in time will further limit our ability to evalu-
ate the overall effectiveness of the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon
Fox Suicide Prevention grant program on improving veterans’ men-
tal health.

In testimony delivered during the March 11, 2025, Health Sub-
committee legislative hearing, VA addressed its concerns with the
bill as drafted:
‘‘VA is concerned about allowing grantees to use a dif-
ferent protocol for the baseline mental health screening for
risk besides the protocol furnished by the Secretary. The
current baseline mental health screening protocol is the
collection of five screenings that assess mental health,
well-being, financial stability, and social support. These in-
form the individual’s treatment plan and referral needs;
they also are vital to program evaluation because they are
conducted both pre- and post-service delivery. To deter-
mine service and program effectiveness, it is essential that
all grantees use the same protocol for this. The Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale is currently a tool used by
VA as one component of eligibility screening, in that it
identifies individuals with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
If Congress’s intent is simply to allow grantees to use a
different protocol to determine the degree of risk for eligi-
bility, we believe this needs to be clarified, though this
could raise concerns with creating disparate approaches.’’
Committee Democrats agree that we must ensure grantees use
the same protocol to conduct both baseline- and post-service mental
health screenings of program participants to properly evaluate the
effectiveness of this program. However, artificially restricting VA
and grantees to using one tool that only measures suicide risk
through statute will fail to meet this goal.
In addition, we are concerned about provisions of H.R. 1969, as
amended, that would dramatically alter the entities that would be
eligible to receive grants. Specifically, we oppose language that
would add ‘‘health care providers’’ as eligible grantees. The Staff
Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention grant program
was designed to allow community-based organizations to help ad-
dress upstream suicide risk factors and provide services to support
veterans’ needs. It was never intended to directly provide clinical
care, particularly mental health care. H.R. 1969, as amended,
would create a loophole for selected community providers to receive
grants of up to $750,000 to furnish mental healthcare to veterans
at VA’s expense, without any requirements to coordinate the vet-
erans’ care with VA. Combined with our existing concerns about
the bill’s lack of requirements to strengthen data collection and
demonstration of effective outcomes, we remain extremely con-
cerned that the lack of guardrails or oversight will weaken the
quality of care provided to veterans.
In its current form, H.R. 1969, as amended, does not reauthorize
this grant program in a way that will meet the needs of our vet-
erans. Accordingly, Democratic members offered several amend-
ments to the bill at full Committee markup, all of which were sum-
marily rejected by the majority. The amendments included:

modify and reauthorize the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox
Suicide Prevention Grant Program of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. It is the belief of the Democratic members that
any effort to reauthorize the Fox Grant program should be in
coordination with our Senate counterparts. We also feel that
the Senate bill, as drafted, provides a better starting point for
reauthorization of the Fox grant program and includes provi-
sions that at least partially address our concerns; namely, the
provision in Section 1(c) that will require VA to collect addi-
tional measures and metrics, to provide better accountability to
Congress and reflect lessons learned from interim reporting on
and evaluation of the grant program.
2. Amendment offered by Rep. Budzinski: Would have re-
quired grantees to prioritize serving veterans who have experi-
enced job loss or unemployment since January 20, 2025. More
than 700,000 veterans are federal employees, which accounts
for about a quarter of the entire federal workforce. Many of
these individuals are either facing job loss or extreme uncer-
tainty about their continued employment, in light of President
Trump’s efforts to reduce the federal workforce. Because job
loss and job insecurity are both known to lead to higher suicide
risk for both men and women veterans, we believe grantees
should prioritize providing services to these veterans.
3. Amendment offered by Ranking Member Takano: Would
have helped strengthen the data collection requirements in
this bill by requiring grantees to conduct post-intervention
mental health assessments using the same validated mental
health screening tool used to conduct the baseline mental
health screening. It is critical for grantees to demonstrate im-
provements in veterans’ mental health and suicide risk factors,
to show that the program is working as intended. Ensuring the
grantees are using the same screening tools to conduct pre-
and post-intervention screenings will help VA and Congress
conduct more robust oversight of the grant program.
Committee Democrats support reauthorization of the Staff Ser-
geant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention grant program and
improving veterans’ access to programs that help reduce suicide
risk. However, as outlined above, we remain concerned about nu-
merous provisions in H.R. 1969, as amended, and we would like to
see a number of changes made before reauthorization legislation is
enacted.
MARK TAKANO,
Ranking Member.
