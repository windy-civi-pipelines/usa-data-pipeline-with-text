PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
H.R. 2037, the Open RAN Outreach Act, was introduced on
March 11, 2025, by Representative Troy Carter (D–LA). The bill di-
rects the Assistant Secretary of the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration (NTIA) to provide outreach and
technical assistance to small communications network providers re-
garding the use, benefits and challenges of Open Radio Access Net-
works (Open RAN) technologies.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
United States communications service providers rely heavily on
equipment and services manufactured and provided by foreign com-
panies. The increasingly globalized market for telecommunications
equipment and services has increased competition and opened the
door to cheaper goods for consumers but poses new challenges for
the United States, particularly for ensuring the security of the tele-
communications supply chain.
To support the development of a competitive market for trusted,
secure network equipment, a growing movement has focused on
Open RAN network architecture, which relies primarily on open-
sourced standards and software to operate wireless communica-
tions networks. Open RAN architecture will potentially allow a net-
work operator to choose network components from various vendors,
rather than relying on one vendor for its entire network, spurring
the development of a competitive marketplace for secure equip-
ment.
While this architecture and related technologies may bring ad-
vantages to communications network providers and the commu-
nications supply chain, it could also pose challenges to smaller com-
munications providers without the resources to integrate several
different kinds of vendors and equipment to create an end-to-end
network. Directing the NTIA to provide this assistance to small
providers will make it more likely that small providers can make
informed decisions about adopting this network architecture.
