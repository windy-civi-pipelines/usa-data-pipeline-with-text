AM RADIO FOR EVERY VEHICLE ACT OF 2025
APRIL3, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 315]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 315) to require the Secretary of
Transportation to issue a rule requiring access to AM broadcast
stations in passenger motor vehicles, and for other purposes, hav-
ing considered the same, reports favorably thereon with an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute and recommends that the bill,
as amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 315, the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act of
2025, is to require the Secretary of Transportation to issue a rule
requiring AM radio in passenger motor vehicles and to require a
study about the role of AM radio in passenger motor vehicles to
transmit public alerts and warnings.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
AM, or amplitude modulation, radio stations serve a critical role
in our Emergency Alert System (EAS), which broadcasts warnings
to the public. EAS distributes emergency alerts via multiple broad-
cast, cable, and satellite systems, beginning with 72 National Pub-
lic Warning System primary entry point (PEP) stations.1 Eighty-six

2
percent of these stations are broadcast AM stations,2 making AM
radio stations the typical initial points of contact for emergency
alerts that are then retransmitted to other electronic media.
AM radio, therefore, is critical to domestic emergency manage-
ment. With this in mind, Congress directed the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the Integrated Public Alert and
Warning System Modernization Act of 2015 to upgrade PEP sta-
tions across the country to maintain broadcast radio services dur-
ing emergencies.3 PEPs are designed to withstand natural disas-
ters and acts of terrorism, and are equipped with backup commu-
nication devices and power generators to allow for continuity of
service.4 (Because it is a nationwide service, SiriusXM satellite
radio backs up the PEP system for nationwide emergency alerts
but not for State and local alerts.)5
Some critics of AM radio’s role in EAS say it is highly susceptible
to interference.6 In response to a December 2022 letter from Sen-
ator Edward Markey questioning automakers’ (i.e., original equip-
ment manufacturers or OEMs) decision not to include broadcast
AM radio in battery-powered electric vehicles, several OEMs re-
sponded that new technology used in electric vehicles (EVs) inter-
feres with AM broadcast signals with varied explanations about en-
gineering counter measures to avoid AM radio or car performance
issues or decisions to remove AM radio from certain models.7 For
example, BMW said it decided not to include AM radio in recent
EV and hybrid models because ‘‘electromagnetic interference [EMI]
creates poor analog AM radio reception quality’’ and the technology
is outdated.8 However, other automakers disagreed. Kia said it was
‘‘not aware of any issues with [EMI] with AM signals from our
EVs.’’9 Ford, after initially removing AM radio,10 reversed its deci-
sion in May 2023 after coming to recognize ‘‘the importance of AM
broadcast radio as a part of the emergency alert system.’’11

stations around the United States, as well as the role AM radio

stations play in the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System
(IPAWS) and during times of disaster and emergency response, the
Committee believes the decision by OEMs to remove broadcast AM
radio from vehicles presents a public safety concern. To address
this concern, this legislation requires the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Transportation (DOT) to issue a rule requiring access to
AM broadcast stations in passenger motor vehicles at no additional
charge.
The Committee is sensitive to the fact that technology evolves
over time, which may impact the need for this rule. To address this
possibility, the legislation also instructs the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) to study the advantages, effectiveness, limita-
tions, resilience, and accessibility of IPAWS via AM radio or other
technologies in passenger motor vehicles and efforts to integrate
new or emerging technologies in IPAWS.
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 315, the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act of 2025, would do the
following:
• Require the Secretary of the DOT, in consultation with the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to issue a rule re-
quiring devices that can receive signals and play content trans-
mitted by AM broadcast stations be installed as standard
equipment in passenger motor vehicles manufactured in the
United States, imported into the United States, or shipped in
interstate commerce after the effective date of the rule.
• Sunset the rule and its enforcement 10 years after the date of
enactment.
• Require the GAO to study the role of passenger motor vehicles
in IPAWS, assess AM radio and alternative communication
systems for delivering emergency alerts and critical public
safety information distributed by IPAWS to drivers and pas-
sengers of motor vehicles, and describe efforts to integrate new
and emerging technologies into IPAWS. The GAO would be re-
quired to brief the appropriate committees of Congress not
later than 1 year after enactment and provide a report not
later than 180 days after the briefing.
• Require the Secretary of DOT, in coordination with the FEMA
Administrator and the FCC, to provide a report not less fre-
quently than once every 5 years after the date on which the
Secretary issues the rule, on the impacts of the rule and pos-
sible changes to IPAWS communication technologies that
would enable resilient and accessible alerts to drivers and pas-
sengers of passenger motor vehicles.

kowski, Mullin, Cortez Masto, Rosen, Boozman, McCormick, War-
ren, Whitehouse, Crapo, Ossoff, Kennedy, Tuberville, Moody, and
Gillibrand are additional cosponsors. On February 5, 2025, the
Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, or-
dered S. 315 reported favorably with an amendment (in the nature
of a substitute).
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 315 would direct the Department of Transportation (DOT) to
issue a rule requiring that AM broadcast stations be accessible in
all passenger motor vehicles imported into, shipped within, or man-
ufactured and sold within the United States. (Passenger motor ve-
hicles are those designed to primarily carry their operator and up
to 12 passengers; the definition does not include motorcycles.) The
bill would require DOT to issue the rule within one year of enact-
ment and report to the Congress at least every five years on the
rule’s effects. The rule would sunset 10 years after enactment.
Additionally, S. 315 would require the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) within 18 months of enactment to report on
the role AM broadcasts in passenger vehicles play in disseminating
emergency alerts through the Integrated Public Alert and Warning
System.
Using information on the cost of issuing similar rules and re-
ports, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost DOT
and GAO a total of $1 million over the 2025–2030 period. Any
spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
Additionally, S. 315 would authorize DOT to assess civil pen-
alties on manufacturers that fail to comply with the new rule; such
penalties are recorded as revenues. CBO estimates that any addi-
tional revenues collected would total less than $500,000 over the

2025–2035 period because the number of violations would probably
be small.
The bill would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) on the manufacturers of
passenger vehicles sold in the United States by requiring them to
provide access to AM broadcast stations at no cost to the consumer.
Prior to the regulation taking effect, manufacturers would be re-
quired to provide access to AM broadcast stations in unequipped
vehicles at no cost if requested.
CBO expects this would primarily affect manufacturers of electric
vehicles (EVs) who have removed, or announced plans to remove,
standard AM radio equipment from their vehicles. The bill also
would prohibit future phase-outs in other vehicles where the equip-
ment is standard, such as gasoline and diesel passenger vehicles,
while the rule is in effect.
Based on sales data for EVs, the legislation would require manu-
facturers to update radio equipment in about 2 to 2.5 million vehi-
cles each year. Since most EVs are already equipped with FM
radio, this would likely result in a small increase in production
costs to update the media system software and modify other radio
components. CBO estimates the total cost of the mandate would be
several millions of dollars each year the requirement is in effect
and would not exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA
for private-sector mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annu-
ally for inflation).
As a result of the legislation, some manufacturers may elect to
make other modifications to the vehicle as well to improve audio
quality. These modifications are not considered part of the costs to
comply with the mandate because they would be made at the dis-
cretion of the manufacturer.
The bill also would preempt state and local laws by prohibiting
those entities from enforcing any laws or regulations pertaining to
the access of AM broadcast stations in passenger vehicles. CBO es-
timates that the preemption would not result in an increase in or
loss of revenue to state or local governments and therefore would
fall well below the threshold in UMRA for intergovernmental man-
dates ($103 million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Willow Latham-
Proenc¸a (for federal costs) and Brandon Lever (for mandates). The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.

Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 315 is intended to bolster public safety and preserve invest-
ments made by the Federal Government in the National Public
Warning System by requiring the Secretary of DOT to issue a rule
that broadcast AM radio be available in every passenger motor ve-
hicle manufactured in, imported into, or shipped in interstate com-

merce within the United States for a 10-year period. The bill af-
fects the manufacturers, importers, and shippers of passenger
motor vehicles in the United States, all of which are already sub-
ject to regulation by DOT. Therefore, the number of persons cov-
ered should be consistent with the current levels of manufacturers,
importers, and shippers subject to regulation by DOT and its var-
ious modal administrations like the National Highway Traffic Safe-
ty Administration.
Economic Impact
S. 315 would have minimal economic impact on OEMs and indi-
viduals who purchase vehicles. While the bill would impose an un-
funded private-sector mandate on manufacturers of passenger vehi-
cles by requiring them to provide consumers access to AM broad-
cast stations at no cost, the Congressional Budget Office estimates
the total cost of the mandate would not exceed the annual thresh-
old established in Unfunded Mandates Reform Act for private-sec-
tor mandates. With regards to private individuals or businesses,
the bill would require manufacturers, in the period between
issuance of the rule and its effective date, to provide clear and con-
spicuous labeling to inform purchasers if a motor vehicle does not
include AM radio. Clear and conspicuous labeling is already re-
quired of the manufacturers for various items like fuel economy.
Privacy
S. 315 would not have an impact on the personal privacy of indi-
viduals.
Paperwork
The Committee anticipates some increase in paperwork burdens
resulting from the passage of this legislation. There may be an in-
crease of paperwork associated with manufacturers documenting
compliance with this law. The bill requires a GAO report that
would study disseminating emergency alerts and warnings to the
public and assess the role of passenger motor vehicles in IPAWS
communications.
The Secretary of the DOT, in coordination with the FEMA Ad-
ministrator and the FCC, would be required to provide a report not
less frequently than once every 5 years after the date on which the
Secretary issues the rule, on the impacts of the rule and possible
changes to IPAWS communication technologies that would enable
resilient and accessible alerts to drivers and passengers of pas-
senger motor vehicles.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the ‘‘AM
Radio for Every Vehicle Act of 2025’’.

Section 2. Definitions.
This section would define the terms ‘‘Administrator’’, ‘‘AM broad-
cast band’’, ‘‘AM broadcast station’’, ‘‘appropriate committees of
Congress’’’, ‘‘Comptroller General’’, ‘‘device’’, ‘‘digital audio AM
broadcast station’’, ‘‘IPAWS’’, ‘‘manufacturer’’, ‘‘passenger motor ve-
hicle’’, ‘‘radio broadcast station’’, ‘‘radio station license’’, ‘‘receive’’,
‘‘Secretary’’, ‘‘signal’’, ‘‘standard equipment’’, and ‘‘State’’.
Section 3. AM broadcast stations rule.
This section would require the Secretary of Transportation, in
consultation with the FEMA Administrator and the FCC, to issue
a rule requiring devices that can receive AM broadcast signals and
play content transmitted be installed as standard equipment in
passenger motor vehicles manufactured in the United States, im-
ported into the United States, or shipped in interstate commerce
after the effective date of the rule.
In the interim period between issuance of the rule and its effec-
tive date, it would require car manufacturers to provide clear and
conspicuous labeling to inform purchasers if a passenger motor ve-
hicle does not include AM radio and prohibit manufacturers from
up charging for access to AM radio in the interim period.
This section would also require GAO to conduct a study on dis-
seminating emergency alerts and warnings to the public, including
an assessment of IPAWS communications. GAO would be required
to brief the appropriate committees of Congress on the results of
the study not later than 1 year after the date of enactment, as well
as to submit a corresponding report not later than 180 days after
the date of the briefing. It would also require the Secretary of DOT,
in coordination with the FEMA Administrator and the FCC, to pro-
vide a report not less frequently than once every 5 years after the
date on which the Secretary issues the rule, on the impacts of the
rule and possible changes to IPAWS communication technologies
that would enable resilient and accessible alerts to drivers and pas-
sengers of passenger motor vehicles.
Lastly, this section would sunset the rule after 10 years from
date of enactment.
CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW
In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported
would make no change to existing law.
