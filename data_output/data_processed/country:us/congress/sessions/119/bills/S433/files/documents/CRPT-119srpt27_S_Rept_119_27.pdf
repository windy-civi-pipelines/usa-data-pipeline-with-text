Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 433]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 433) to require the Secretary of
Commerce to establish the National Manufacturing Advisory Coun-
cil within the Department of Commerce, and for other purposes,
having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with an
amendment and recommends that the bill, as amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 433 is to require the Secretary of Commerce
to establish the National Manufacturing Advisory Council within
the Department of Commerce.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
The United States has a long history of a strong manufacturing
industry, employing millions of Americans across the country. Ac-
cording to the National Association of Manufacturers, currently 13
million people are employed by more than 244,000 manufacturers
in the United States, adding more than $2.93 trillion to the Amer-
ican economy.1 In 2023, manufacturing contributed $2.3 trillion to

U.S. GDP, amounting to 10.2 percent of total U.S. GDP.2 Including
indirect value added, manufacturing value added contributed an es-
timated 17.1 percent of GDP to the United States in 2023.3
The United States Manufacturing Council of the International
Trade Administration was chartered in 2004 to ensure regular com-
munication between the Government and the manufacturing sec-
tor; advise the Secretary of Commerce on Government policies and
programs that affect U.S. manufacturing and provide a forum for
discussing and proposing solutions to industry-related problems;
and ensure the United States remains the preeminent destination
for investment in manufacturing throughout the world.4 The Man-
ufacturing Council was terminated 2016, as set in its charter.5
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 433 would create an Advisory Council within the Department
of Commerce according to the following parameters:
• The Advisory Council will be required to be formed within 180
days of enactment and meet at least every 180 days to provide
advice and recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce re-
garding issues involving manufacturing in the United States.
• The Advisory Council will be required to identify and assess
impacts of technological developments, production capacity,
skills, investment patterns, and emerging defense needs on the
manufacturing competitiveness of the United States.
• The Advisory Council will solicit input from public and private
sectors, and academia, on emerging manufacturing trends. The
Advisory Council would use this input to advise the Secretary
of Commerce on programs and policies that affect certain areas
of manufacturing and potential regulatory barriers to the man-
ufacturing sector.
• The Advisory Council will produce an annual national strategic
plan detailing its activities, which would be provided to the
Secretary of Commerce and the relevant congressional commit-
tees.
• Membership for the Advisory Council will not consist of more
than 30 individuals from private industry, academia, and
labor. All functions of the United States Manufacturing Coun-
cil of the International Trade Administration, or similar exist-
ing advisory committees, will be transferred to the Advisory
Council.
• The Advisory Council will sunset after 5 years.

Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget

problems affecting U.S. manufacturing, provide advice about fed-
eral programs that affect manufacturing, and produce an annual
strategic manufacturing plan. The bill also would transfer the func-
tions of the U.S. Manufacturing Council at the department to the
new advisory council. The new council would include members with
manufacturing experience in private industry. The council would
sunset between five and six years after its first meeting.
Based on the cost of similar advisory committees, CBO estimates
that operating the council would cost less than $500,000 for staff
salaries, travel costs, and other expenses; any related spending
would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Zunara Naeem. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
In accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evalua-
tion of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported:
Number of Persons Covered
S. 433 would designate a maximum of 30 people to be on the Na-
tional Manufacturing Advisory Council. These individuals would
need to have manufacturing experience and represent private in-
dustry, including small and medium-sized manufacturers, relevant
standards development organizations, relevant trade associations;
academia; and labor. Members of the council would be appointed by
the Secretary of Commerce, with public input, for a term of 3
years, which could be renewed for up to two additional terms.
Other individuals in manufacturing could be impacted through
changes in Federal Government policy relating to manufacturing
based on the Council’s advice and national strategic plan for manu-
facturing in the United States.
Economic Impact
S. 433 may have a positive economic impact. S. 433 would re-
quire the Advisory Council to create a national strategic plan for
manufacturing in the United States and create regular communica-
tion between the Federal Government and the manufacturing sec-
tor.
Privacy
S. 433 is not anticipated to have an impact on the personal pri-
vacy of individuals and would not provide any additional require-
ments or allowances that impact business privacy.
Paperwork
The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paper-
work burdens resulting from the passage of this legislation. In
areas where additional paperwork may be required, the purpose
would be to create a national strategic plan for manufacturing in
section 2, which is aimed at discussing how the Government can

from economically distressed areas, geographically diverse regions,
and areas of the United States that have suffered mass layoffs in
the manufacturing sector.

dustry, academia, and labor. It would further direct the Secretary
