REMOVING OUR UNSECURE TECHNOLOGIES TO ENSURE
RELIABILITY AND SECURITY ACT
JUNE2, 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 244]
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 244) to direct the Secretary of Com-
merce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for
Communications and Information, to conduct a study of the na-
tional security risks posed by consumer routers, modems, and de-
vices that combine a modem and router, and for other purposes,
having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with amend-
ments and recommends that the bill, as amended, do pass.
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 244 is to require the Secretary of Commerce
to conduct a study of the national security risks and cybersecurity
vulnerabilities posed by consumer routers, modems, and devices
that combine a modem and router made by, in, or owned by certain
countries.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Wireless routers are the primary access point to the internet for
millions of Americans and small businesses; however, many of
these routers are vulnerable to infiltration by foreign adversaries.1

China in particular has infected routers in the United States and
other countries, stealing intellectual property and pre-positioning
in critical infrastructure.2 Recent cyberattacks have led to inves-
tigations into TP-Link, a Chinese router-manufacturer, by the
Commerce, Defense, and Justice departments.3
In August 2024, the House Select Committee on the Chinese
Communist Party sent a letter to former Secretary of Commerce
Gina Raimondo requesting that TP-Link be investigated due to its
‘‘unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with
PRC law.’’4 S. 244 would require the Secretary to conduct a study
and report on the national security risks and cybersecurity
vulnerabilities posed by consumer routers, modems, and devices
that combine a modem and router designed, developed, manufac-
tured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to
the malign influence of a covered country, as currently defined in
law. Under current law, a covered nation is defined as the Demo-
cratic People’s Republic of North Korea; the People’s Republic of
China; the Russian Federation; and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Luja´n) and was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation of the Senate.
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office:
S. 244 would require the Department of Commerce to study the
national security risks and cybersecurity vulnerabilities posed by
consumer routers, modems, and devices that combine a modem and
a router that are designed, manufactured, or supplied by an organi-
zation owned or controlled by North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran.
The bill also would require the department to report to the Con-
gress on the results of the study.
Based on the cost of previous studies, CBO estimates it would
cost $1 million over the 2025–2030 period to research and write the
report. Any related spending would be subject to the availability of
appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Margot Berman. The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 244 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
