to supervise sentenced criminal offenders.’’.
Amend the title so as to read:
A bill to amend the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act
to provide for a free annual National Parks and Federal Rec-
reational Lands Pass for law enforcement officers and firefighters.
PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION
The purpose of H.R. 183, as ordered reported, is to amend the
Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to provide for a free
annual National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass for
law enforcement officers and firefighters.
BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Currently, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act
(FLREA) authorizes each of the federal land management agencies
to issue the ‘‘America the Beautiful—the National Parks and Fed-
eral Recreational Lands Pass,’’ which covers entrance fees and
standard amenity fees at more than 2,000 federal recreation
areas.1 Since FLREA’s passage, Congress has enacted several laws
to offer free or discounted recreation passes to senior citizens, indi-
viduals with disabilities, veterans, active-duty military service
members, and Gold Star Family members.2 Most recently, Con-
gress enacted the ‘‘Alexander Lofgren Veterans in Parks (VIP) Act’’
in 2021 to provide free lifetime passes to veterans and Gold Star
Families and free annual passes to active-duty military
servicemembers.3
H.R. 183, the ‘‘Law Enforcement Officer and Firefighter Recre-
ation Pass Act,’’ would provide free annual recreation passes to na-
tional parks and public lands to federal, state, Tribal, or local law
enforcement officers and firefighters. The bill seeks to honor the
sacrifices of law enforcement officers and firefighters who put their
lives on the line daily to protect public safety. In many cases, par-
ticularly in the West, local law enforcement officers and firefighters
are often the first line of defense for search and rescue operations,
preventing crime and vandalism, and suppressing wildland fires
that occur on public lands. Providing free access to the lands that
these brave men and women defend and protect is the least we
could do to show our appreciation for their continued service and
sacrifice.
COMMITTEE ACTION
H.R. 183 was introduced on January 3, 2025, by Representative
Tom McClintock (R–CA). The bill was referred to the Committee on
Natural Resources. The bill was also referred to the Committee on
Agriculture. On June 25, 2025, the Committee on Natural Re-
sources met to consider the bill. Representative Tom McClintock of-
fered an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute designated
McClintock_051 ANS. The Amendment in the Nature of a Sub-
stitute agreed to by unanimous consent. The bill, as amended, was
116 U.S.C. 6804.
