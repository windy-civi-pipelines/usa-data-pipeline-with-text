I. PURPOSE AND BILL SUMMARY
On January 28, 2025, Rep. Latimer, along with Rep. Alford and
Rep. Mfume, introduced H.R. 789, Transparency and Predictability
in Small Business Opportunities Act. H.R. 789 directs the Small
Business Administration (SBA) to implement a rule requiring fed-
eral agencies to submit information on cancelled contract solicita-
tions, such as a request for proposal, and indicate whether the so-
licitation be reissued. Further, this bill requires agencies to connect
small businesses that have submitted proposals for contract solici-
tations that are cancelled with the Office of Small and Disadvan-
taged Business Utilization (OSDBU) to assist in identifying similar
contract opportunities. The intent of this bill is that it only per-
tains to pre-award solicitations, and does not extend to awarded
contracts that are cancelled.
II. NEED FOR LEGISLATION
Frequently, businesses will submit bids on federal contract solici-
tations, costing them a tremendous amount of time, effort, and
money. If these contract solicitations are cancelled, these busi-
nesses will have expended those considerable resources for no ben-
efit. This is particularly impactful on small businesses, who have
reduced access to capital. This bill would help those firms find
similar contract opportunities to bid on and publicize an agency’s
future plans with regard to the canceled solicitation.
An agency contract solicitation is an early stage in the procure-
ment process where the agency communicates with the public what
it intends to procure. This is when a small business would submit
a proposal or bid for the contract. Agencies regularly cancel these
solicitations and sometimes bundle what they initially planned to
procure with additional items the agency needs.
III. HEARINGS
On February 5, 2025, the Committee on Small Business held a
hearing examining matters related to H.R. 789 titled ‘‘Hope on the
Horizon: Prioritizing Small Business Growth in the 119th Con-
gress.’’
IV. COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION
The Committee on Small Business met in open session, with a
quorum being present, on March 5, 2025, and ordered H.R. 789 to
be favorably reported to the House of Representatives. During the
markup no amendments were offered.
V. COMMITTEE VOTES
Clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the mo-
tion to report legislation and amendments thereto. The Committee
voted to favorably report H.R. 789 to the House of Representatives
at 11:45 AM.

VI. SECTION-BY-SECTION OF H.R. 789
Section 1—Short title
This bill may be cited as the ‘‘Transparency and Predictability in
Small Business Opportunities Act.’’
Section 2—Small Business Administration rules for cancelled cov-
ered solicitations
This section requires the SBA Administrator to issue rules on the
collection of information on cancelled solicitations from agencies
within 180 days of enactment.
Agencies must share a justification for canceling the solicitation,
any plans to reissue the solicitation, and any plans to include the
contract requirements in another contract or task order.
If an agency does not plan to reissue the solicitation, the agency
must refer a small business that prepared a contract bid to the re-
spective agency’s OSDBU Director.
The information shared by agencies to the SBA will be publicly
available online.
The Directors of each agency’s OSDBU will assist small busi-
nesses that prepared a bid on identifying similar contracting oppor-
tunities as the cancelled solicitation.
VII. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
Pursuant to 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The
Committee has requested but not received from the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office a cost estimate for the Committee’s
provisions.
VIII. NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND
TAX EXPENDITURES
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives and section 308(a)(I) of the Congressional Budg-
et Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following opinion and
estimate with respect to new budget authority, entitlement author-
ity, and tax expenditures. While the Committee has not received an
estimate of new budget authority contained in the cost estimate
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursu-
ant to Sec. 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Com-
mittee does not believe that there will be any additional costs at-
tributable to this legislation. H.R. 789 does not direct new spend-
ing, but instead reallocates funding independently authorized and
appropriated.
IX. OVERSIGHT FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
In accordance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII and clause 2(b)(1)
of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the over-
sight findings and recommendations of the Committee on Small
Business with respect to the subject matter contained in the H.R.
789 are incorporated into the descriptive portions of this report.

With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, there are no specific
performance goals and objectives of H.R. 789.
XI. STATEMENT OF DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, no provision of H.R. 789 is known to be duplica-
tive of another Federal program, including any program that was
included in a report to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139 or the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic As-
sistance.
XII. CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND
LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS
With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that the bill does not con-
tain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited
tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of rule XXI of
the Rules of the House of Representatives.
XIII. FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
XIV. FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act were created by this legislation.
XV. APPLICABILITY TO LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or
accommodations within the meaning of section 102(b)(3) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act.
XVI. STATEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII of the Rules of the House, the

SMALL BUSINESS ACT
* * * * * * *
SEC. 15.
(a) SMALL BUSINESS PROCUREMENTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this Act, small business
concerns shall receive any award or contract if such award or
contract is, in the determination of the Administrator and the
contracting agency, in the interest of—
(A) maintaining or mobilizing the full productive capac-
ity of the United States;
(B) war or national defense programs; or
(C) assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases
and contracts for goods and services of the Government in
each industry category (as defined under paragraph (2))
are awarded to small business concerns.
(2) INDUSTRY CATEGORY DEFINED.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—In this subsection, the term ‘‘industry
category’’ means a discrete group of similar goods and
services, as determined by the Administrator in accordance
with the North American Industry Classification System
codes used to establish small business size standards, ex-
cept that the Administrator shall limit an industry cat-
egory to a greater extent than provided under the North
American Industry Classification System codes if the Ad-
ministrator receives evidence indicating that further seg-
mentation of the industry category is warranted—
(i) due to special capital equipment needs;
(ii) due to special labor requirements;
(iii) due to special geographic requirements, except
as provided in subparagraph (B);
(iv) due to unique Federal buying patterns or re-
quirements; or
(v) to recognize a new industry.
(B) EXCEPTION FOR GEOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS.—The
Administrator may not further segment an industry cat-
egory based on geographic requirements unless—
(i) the Government typically designates the geo-
graphic area where work for contracts for goods or
services is to be performed;
(ii) Government purchases comprise the major por-
tion of the entire domestic market for such goods or
services; and
(iii) it is unreasonable to expect competition from
business concerns located outside of the general geo-
graphic area due to the fixed location of facilities, high
mobilization costs, or similar economic factors.

(3) DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO AWARDS OR CON-
TRACTS.—Determinations made pursuant to paragraph (1) may
be made for individual awards or contracts, any part of an
award or contract or task order, or for classes of awards or con-
tracts or task orders.
(4) INCREASING PRIME CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR
SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.—
(A) DESCRIPTION OF COVERED PROPOSED PROCURE-
MENTS.—The requirements of this paragraph shall apply to
a proposed procurement that includes in its statement of
work goods or services currently being supplied or per-
formed by a small business concern and, as determined by
the Administrator—
(i) is in a quantity or of an estimated dollar value
which makes the participation of a small business con-
cern as a prime contractor unlikely;
(ii) in the case of a proposed procurement for con-
struction, seeks to bundle or consolidate discrete con-
struction projects; or
(iii) is a solicitation that involves an unnecessary or
unjustified bundling of contract requirements.
(B) NOTICE TO PROCUREMENT CENTER REPRESENTA-
TIVES.—With respect to proposed procurements described
in subparagraph (A), at least 30 days before issuing a so-
licitation and concurrent with other processing steps re-
quired before issuing the solicitation, the contracting agen-
cy shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the
procurement center representative of the contracting agen-
cy (as described in subsection (l)) along with a statement
explaining—
(i) why the proposed procurement cannot be divided
into reasonably small lots (not less than economic pro-
duction runs) to permit offers on quantities less than
the total requirement;
(ii) why delivery schedules cannot be established on
a realistic basis that will encourage the participation
of small business concerns in a manner consistent
with the actual requirements of the Government;
(iii) why the proposed procurement cannot be offered
to increase the likelihood of the participation of small
business concerns;
(iv) in the case of a proposed procurement for con-
struction, why the proposed procurement cannot be of-
fered as separate discrete projects; or
(v) why the contracting agency has determined that
the bundling of contract requirements is necessary
and justified.
(C) ALTERNATIVES TO INCREASE PRIME CONTRACTING OP-
PORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.—If the pro-
curement center representative believes that the proposed
procurement will make the participation of small business
concerns as prime contractors unlikely, the procurement
center representative, within 15 days after receiving the
statement described in subparagraph (B), shall recommend
to the contracting agency alternative procurement methods

for increasing prime contracting opportunities for small
business concerns.
(D) FAILURE TO AGREE ON AN ALTERNATIVE PROCURE-
MENT METHOD.—If the procurement center representative
and the contracting agency fail to agree on an alternative
procurement method, the Administrator shall submit the
matter to the head of the appropriate department or agen-
cy for a determination.
(5) CONTRACTS FOR SALE OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.—With
respect to a contract for the sale of Government property,
small business concerns shall receive any such contract if, in
the determination of the Administrator and the disposal agen-
cy, the award of such contract is in the interest of assuring
that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property
be made to small business concerns.
(6) SALE OF ELECTRICAL POWER OR OTHER PROPERTY.—Noth-
ing in this subsection shall be construed to change any pref-
erences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale
of electrical power or other property by the Federal Govern-
ment.
(7) COSTS EXCEEDING FAIR MARKET PRICE.—A contract may
not be awarded under this subsection if the cost of the contract
to the awarding agency exceeds a fair market price.
(b) With respect to any work to be performed the amount of
which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for
which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under section 411
of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 694(b)),
the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable,
place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern
to perform such work.
(c)(1) As used in this subsection:
(A) The term ‘‘Committee’’ means the Committee for Pur-
chase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped estab-
lished under the first section of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to cre-
ate a Committee on Purchases of Blind-made Products, and for
other purposes’’, approved June 25, 1938 (41 U.S.C. 46).
(B) The term ‘‘public or private organization for the handi-
capped’’ has the same meaning given such term in section 3(e).
(C) The term ‘‘handicapped individual’’ has the same mean-
ing given such term in section 3(f).
(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for
the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs author-
ized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$40,000,000.
(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subpara-
graph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the
Committee pursuant to section 2 of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to cre-
ate a Committee on Purchases of Blind-made Products, and for
other purposes’’, approved June 25, 1938 (41 U.S.C. 47).
(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participa-
tion.
(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a pro-
posed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public
or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small busi-
ness concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe

economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an ap-
peal of the proposed award with the Administrator.
(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under
subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with
the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has
experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the
result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the
filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency
and department having procurement powers to take such action as
may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely
to be sustained by the concern.
(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers
shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time
a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall in-
clude in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by
a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procure-
ment Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sen-
tence through the Federal procurement data system and shall re-
port to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and
departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized
under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.
(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded
only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each
item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop
or performed in providing each type of service under the contract
by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individ-
uals.
(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organiza-
tion pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use
multiyear contracts, if appropriate.
(d) For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the
awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small
business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of
the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of
concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor
surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provison of law, total
labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy
Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be
authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines
that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained
from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be
made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent
possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be
given to those persons who would be available for employment
were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects
such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.
(e) PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES; CONTRACT BUNDLING.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—To the maximum extent practicable, pro-
curement strategies used by a Federal department or agency
having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum par-
ticipation of small business concerns as prime contractors, sub-
contractors, and suppliers, and each such Federal department
or agency shall—

(A) provide opportunities for the participation of small
business concerns during acquisition planning processes
and in acquisition plans; and
(B) invite the participation of the appropriate Director of
Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisi-
tion planning processes and provide that Director access to
acquisition plans.
(2) MARKET RESEARCH.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Before proceeding with an acquisition
strategy that could lead to a contract containing consoli-
dated procurement requirements, the head of an agency
shall conduct market research to determine whether con-
solidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.
(B) FACTORS.—For purposes of subparagraph (A), con-
solidation of the requirements may be determined as being
necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that
would be derived from contracting to meet those require-
ments if not consolidated, the Federal Government would
derive from the consolidation measurably substantial bene-
fits, including any combination of benefits that, in com-
bination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in
the preceding sentence may include the following:
(i) Cost savings.
(ii) Quality improvements.
(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.
(iv) Better terms and conditions.
(v) Any other benefits.
(C) REDUCTION OF COSTS NOT DETERMINATIVE.—The re-
duction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not
be a justification for bundling of contract requirements un-
less the cost savings are expected to be substantial in rela-
tion to the dollar value of the procurement requirements
to be consolidated.
(3) STRATEGY SPECIFICATIONS.—If the head of a contracting
agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement
involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the
head of a contracting agency shall publish a notice on a public
website that such determination has been made not later than
7 days after making such determination. Any solicitation for a
procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be pub-
lished earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along
with the publication of the solicitation, the head of a con-
tracting agency shall publish a justification for the determina-
tion, which shall include the following information:
(A) The specific benefits anticipated to be derived from
the bundling of contract requirements and a determination
that such benefits justify the bundling.
(B) An identification of any alternative contracting ap-
proaches that would involve a lesser degree of bundling of
contract requirements.
(C) An assessment of—
(i) the specific impediments to participation by small
business concerns as prime contractors that result
from the bundling of contract requirements; and

(ii) the specific actions designed to maximize partici-
pation of small business concerns as subcontractors
(including suppliers) at various tiers under the con-
tract or contracts that are awarded to meet the re-
quirements.
(4) CONTRACT TEAMING.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a solicitation of offers
for a bundled or consolidated contract that is issued by the
head of an agency, a small business concern that provides
for use of a particular team of subcontractors or a joint
venture of small business concerns may submit an offer for
the performance of the contract.
(B) EVALUATION OF OFFERS.—The head of the agency
shall evaluate an offer described in subparagraph (A) in
the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to
the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors or
members of the joint venture as follows:
(i) TEAMS.—When evaluating an offer of a small
business prime contractor that includes a proposed
team of small business subcontractors, the head of the
agency shall consider the capabilities and past per-
formance of each first tier subcontractor that is part of
the team as the capabilities and past performance of
the small business prime contractor.
(ii) JOINT VENTURES.—When evaluating an offer of a
joint venture of small business concerns, if the joint
venture does not demonstrate sufficient capabilities or
past performance to be considered for award of a con-
tract opportunity, the head of the agency shall con-
sider the capabilities and past performance of each
member of the joint venture as the capabilities and
past performance of the joint venture.
(C) STATUS AS A SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.—Participa-
tion of a small business concern in a team or a joint ven-
ture under this paragraph shall not affect the status of
that concern as a small business concern for any other
purpose.
(5) PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS OF JOINT VENTURES FOR
SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.—With respect to evaluating an
offer for a prime contract made by a small business concern
that previously participated in a joint venture with another
business concern (whether or not such other business concern
was a small business concern), the Administrator shall estab-
lish regulations—
(A) allowing the small business concern to elect to use
the past performance of the joint venture if the small busi-
ness concern has no relevant past performance of its own;
(B) requiring the small business concern, when making
an election under subparagraph (A)—
(i) to identify to the contracting officer the joint ven-
ture of which the small business concern was a mem-
ber; and
(ii) to inform the contracting officer what duties and
responsibilities the small business concern carried out
as part of the joint venture; and

(C) requiring a contracting officer, if the small business
concern makes an election under subparagraph (A), to con-
sider the past performance of the joint venture when eval-
uating the past performance of the small business concern,
giving due consideration to the information provided under
subparagraph (B)(ii).
(f) CONTRACTING PREFERENCE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS IN
A MAJOR DISASTER AREA.—
(1) DEFINITION.—In this subsection, the term ‘‘disaster area’’
means the area for which the President has declared a major
disaster, during the period of the declaration.
(2) CONTRACTING PREFERENCE.—An agency shall provide a
contracting preference for a small business concern located in
a disaster area if the small business concern will perform the
work required under the contract in the disaster area.
(3) CREDIT FOR MEETING CONTRACTING GOALS.—If an agency
awards a contract to a small business concern under the cir-
cumstances described in paragraph (2), the value of the con-
tract shall be doubled for purposes of determining compliance
with the goals for procurement contracts under subsection
(g)(1)(A).
(g)
(1) GOVERNMENTWIDE GOALS.—
(A) ESTABLISHMENT.—The President shall annually es-
tablish Governmentwide goals for procurement contracts
awarded to small business concerns, small business con-
cerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans,
qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small busi-
ness concerns owned and controlled by socially and eco-
nomically disadvantaged individuals, and small business
concerns owned and controlled by women in accordance
with the following:
(i) The Governmentwide goal for participation by

(v) The Governmentwide goal for participation by
small business concerns owned and controlled by
women shall be established at not less than 5 percent
of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract

agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small
business concerns, small business concerns owned and con-
trolled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone
small business concerns, small business concerns owned
and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals, and small business concerns owned and con-
trolled by women to participate in the performance of con-
tracts let by such agency. The Small Business Administra-
tion and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy
shall, when exercising their authority pursuant to para-
graph (2), insure that the cumulative annual prime con-
tract goals for all agencies meet or exceed the annual Gov-
ernmentwide prime contract goal established by the Presi-

with the Administration, establish goals for the participation by
small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and
controlled by service-disabled veterans, by qualified HUBZone
small business concerns, by small business concerns owned and
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,
and by small business concerns owned and controlled by women in
procurement contracts of such agency. Such goals shall separately
address prime contract awards and subcontract awards for each
category of small business covered.
(B) Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly estab-
lished by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency
and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business con-
cerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-dis-
abled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small
business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economi-
cally disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns
owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to
perform subcontracts under such contracts.
(C) Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal
agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be
submitted to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy for
final determination.
(D) After establishing goals under this paragraph for a fiscal
year, the head of each Federal agency shall develop a plan for
achieving such goals at both the prime contract and the sub-
contract level, which shall apportion responsibilities among the
agency’s acquisition executives and officials. In establishing goals
under this paragraph, the head of each Federal agency shall make
a consistent effort to annually expand participation by small busi-
ness concerns from each industry category in procurement con-
tracts and subcontracts of such agency, including participation by

petition; and
(ii) contracts awarded after competition restricted to eli-
gible small business concerns under this section and under

scribed in clause (ii) shall communicate to the subordinates of
the procurement employee or program manager the importance
of achieving goals established under subparagraph (A).
(ii) A procurement employee or program manager de-
scribed in this clause is a senior procurement executive,
senior program manager, or Director of Small and Dis-
advantaged Business Utilization of a Federal agency hav-
ing contracting authority.

Operating contractors sponsored by the Department of Energy to
small business concerns, small businesses concerns owned and con-
trolled by service disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small busi-
ness concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by so-
cially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small busi-
ness concerns owned and controlled by women, shall be considered
toward the annually established agency and Government-wide
goals for procurement contracts awarded.

ED TO SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.—

XVIII. MINORITY VIEWS
Once a federal agency determines they have a need for certain
products or services, the agency’s acquisition personnel will post a
solicitation on the federal government’s SAM.gov website for a con-
tract to fill the requirements. This solicitation will identify what
the agency intends to buy, the procedures they will use to do it,
and a deadline for companies to submit bids or proposals.
When responding to a solicitation, small businesses can spend
significant time and money preparing a proposal. In his written
testimony submitted for a House Small Business Committee hear-
ing on February 6, 2024, entitled: ‘‘Under the Microscope: Review-
ing the SBA’s Small Business Size Standards,’’ witness Andrew
Christ stated: ‘‘Traditionally, the process of putting in a solicitation
response is very costly. The requirements for the solicitation re-
sponses continue to expand and . . . it requires a small business to
expend a significant amount of money to develop a detailed proposal
submission. On average, our proposal responses cost approximately
$10,000.00 worth of labor to draft, develop, review, and execute.
This is a substantial expenditure for a small business.’’1
There are separate rules based on different types of procure-
ments and reasons for cancellations but once a solicitation is
issued, federal agencies have broad discretion to amend or cancel
it. An agency needs to have a reasonable basis to cancel a solicita-
tion and provide basic justifications,2 and there are currently rules
around procedures that agencies must use to do so.
The reasons agencies may cancel solicitations can vary widely.
There are circumstances where the solicitations have been modi-
fied, usually as a result of corrective actions, to the extent that it
is simply easier to start over. Agencies will cancel and then reissue
the solicitation for the same work, rather than amend the existing
solicitation. Other times, requirements have changed, the work is
no longer necessary, or the agency will procure the same work in
a different way.
Additionally, issues can arise because of budget changes—includ-
ing budget uncertainty caused by continuing resolutions or lapses
in appropriations—or the funding for the contract being solicited is
no longer available. The unpredictable and changing federal budget
climate is always a challenge for small businesses. In his prepared
statement for the February hearing Mr. Christ, referring cancelled
solicitations, stated: ‘‘As of late, the instability and ambiguity
caused by CRs make it difficult for federal agencies to have cer-
tainty on funding for projects . . . it can create a situation where
the business spends a significant amount of money to develop a pro-

posal response, only to find out that the project has become inac-
tive.’’
Generally, when an agency cancels a solicitation, the reasons are
unknown to offerors and there are no universal requirements that
the agency provide any information to the companies that have
submitted a proposal. Agencies do not have to disclose the reasons
for the cancellation and/or any future plans, which can be frus-
trating and harmful for small businesses who have sunk costs into
their proposal preparation and response.
In 2021, the Department of Defense issued a broad request for
comments regarding barriers facing small businesses in entering
the defense market and competing for DoD contracts. In their re-
sponse, the Women’s Chamber of Commerce included the lack of in-
formation on cancelled solicitations on their list of barriers, stating:
numerous small business contracts that ‘‘just go away without ex-
planation or discussion with the OSDBUs.’’3
In addition to improving transparency and accountability, agen-
cies disclosing additional information regarding the reasons behind
a cancelled solicitation would allow small businesses who put to-
gether costly bids to plan accordingly, amend their business strate-
gies and prepare for future bids.
The legislation will also add to the duties of each federal agency’s
Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU)
that they assist small businesses who have prepared a bid for a
cancelled solicitation with finding additional contracting opportuni-
ties.
