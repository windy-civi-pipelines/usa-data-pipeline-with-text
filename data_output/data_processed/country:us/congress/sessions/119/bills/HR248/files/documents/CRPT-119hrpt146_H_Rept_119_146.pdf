BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
In fiscal year 2024, Amtrak served nearly 32.8 million riders to
500 destinations across 46 states. Parents and families who are
traveling often need to change a newborn child’s diaper, making ac-
cessible, safe, and comfortable changing facilities at stations and
onboard trains essential. This bill would require all newly-acquired
rail equipment to provide baby changing stations in accessible
bathrooms on passenger rail cars and post adequate signage indi-
cating the availability of such baby changing stations.
HEARINGS
For the purposes of rule XIII, clause 3(c)(6)(A) of the 118th Con-
gress the following hearing was used to develop or consider H.R.
248:
On June 12, 2024, the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials held a hearing entitled, ‘‘Amtrak and Intercity
Passenger Rail Oversight: Promoting Performance, Safety, and Ac-
countability.’’ The Subcommittee received testimony from Anthony
Coscia, Amtrak, Chair of the Board of Directors; Stephen Gardner,
Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Amtrak; and, Julie White, Deputy
Secretary for Multimodal Transportation, North Carolina Depart-
ment of Transportation. This hearing focused on examining the
current status of Amtrak, the progress of Amtrak and certain
states in implementing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
and examining current and future issues in intercity passenger
rail.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND CONSIDERATION
H.R. 248, the ‘‘Baby Changing on Board Act,’’ was introduced in
the United States House of Representatives on January 9, 2025, by

Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Ms. Malliotakis of New York, Ms.
Hayes of Connecticut, Mr. Jackson of Illinois, Mr. Lawler of New
York, and Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania, and referred to the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Within the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, H.R. 248 was referred
to the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Mate-
rials. The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 248 on
April 2, 2025.
The Committee considered H.R. 248 on April 2, 2025, and or-
dered the measure to be favorably reported to the House, without

COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee’s over-
sight findings and recommendations are reflected in this report.
NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES
Clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison pre-
pared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under sec-
tion 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely
submitted prior to the filing of the report and is included in the re-
port. Such a cost estimate is included in this report.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has received the
enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 248 from the Director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office:
H.R. 248 would require Amtrak to install baby changing tables
in at least one restroom per rail car on all passenger trains pur-
chased after enactment, including restrooms that are subject to the
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),
and to provide appropriate signage. The requirement would not
apply to trains that are operated, but not owned, by Amtrak. Be-
cause Amtrak is considered a nonfederal entity, CBO estimates
that enacting the bill would have no effect on the federal budget.
Amtrak’s new passenger trains are being designed to include
baby changing stations in all onboard bathrooms, including those
that are ADA-compliant. By requiring Amtrak to comply with addi-
tional signage requirements on all new passenger trains they own,
H.R. 248 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the
cost would not exceed the threshold established in UMRA for pri-

vate-sector mandates ($203 million in 2025, adjusted annually for
inflation).
The bill would not impose an intergovernmental mandate as de-
fined in UMRA.
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Willow Latham-
Proenc¸a (for federal costs) and Brandon Lever (for mandates). The
estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director
of Budget Analysis.
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,
Director, Congressional Budget Office.
PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to the requirement of clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of
the Rules of the House of Representatives, the performance goal
and objective of this legislation is to require Amtrak to install baby
changing tables in bathrooms accessible to passengers with disabil-
ities on passenger rail cars.
DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, the Committee finds that no provision of H.R.
248 establishes or reauthorizes a program of the Federal govern-
ment known to be duplicative of another Federal program, a pro-
gram that was included in any report from the Government Ac-
countability Office to Congress pursuant to section 21 of Public
Law 111–139, or a program related to a program identified in the
most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED
TARIFF BENEFITS
In compliance with clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional
earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined
in clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of rule XXI.
FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENT
The Committee adopts as its own the estimate of Federal man-
dates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office
pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
(Public Law 104–4).
PREEMPTION CLARIFICATION
Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the
report of any Committee on a bill or joint resolution to include a
statement on the extent to which the bill or joint resolution is in-
tended to preempt state, local, or tribal law. The Committee finds
that H.R. 248 does not preempt any state, local, or tribal law.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE STATEMENT
No advisory committees within the definition of Section 5(b) of
Public Law 92–463 (5 U.S.C. 1004(b)), United States Code, are cre-
ated by this legislation.
