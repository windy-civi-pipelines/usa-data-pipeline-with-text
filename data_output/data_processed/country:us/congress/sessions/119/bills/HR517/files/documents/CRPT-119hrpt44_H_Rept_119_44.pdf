SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF RULES FOR POSTPONING CERTAIN DEADLINES BY REASON OF DIS-
ASTER.
(a) AUTHORITY TO POSTPONE FEDERAL TAX DEADLINES BY REASON OF STATE-DE-
CLAREDDISASTERS.—Section 7508A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amend-
ed by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as subsections (d), (e), and (f), re-
spectively, and by inserting after subsection (b) the following new subsection:
‘‘(c) SPECIALRULEFORSTATE-DECLAREDDISASTERS.—
‘‘(1) INGENERAL.—The Secretary (after consultation with the Administrator of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency) may, upon the written request of
the Governor of a State (or the Mayor, in the case of the District of Columbia),
apply the rules of subsections (a) and (b) to a qualified State declared disaster
in the same manner as a disaster, fire, or action otherwise described in sub-
section (a).
‘‘(2) QUALIFIED STATE DECLARED DISASTER.—For purposes of this section, the
term ‘qualified State declared disaster’ means, with respect to any State, any
natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water,
winddriven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, land-
slide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood,
or explosion, in any part of the State, which in the determination of the Gov-
ernor of such State (or the Mayor, in the case of the District of Columbia)
causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant the application
of the rules of this section.

of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam,
American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.’’.

I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND
A. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY
The bill, H.R. 517, the ‘‘Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act,’’
as amended, was ordered reported by the Committee on Ways and
Means on February 26, 2025.
Under the provision, the Secretary may, upon written request of
the Governor of a State (or the Mayor of the District of Columbia),
and in consultation with the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (‘‘FEMA’’), apply the rules of subsection 7508A(a) and sub-
section 7508A(b) to a qualified State declared disaster in the same
manner as a disaster, fire, or action otherwise described in sub-
section 7508A(a).
‘‘Qualified State declared disaster’’ is defined to include any nat-
ural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high
water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, vol-
canic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, re-
gardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the
State, which in the determination of the Governor of such State (or
the Mayor of the District of Columbia) causes damage of sufficient
severity and magnitude to warrant the application of the rules of
this proposal.

The term ‘‘State’’ includes the District of Columbia, the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
The provision also extends the mandatory 60-day suspension pe-
riod1 from 60 days to 120 days.
B. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION
The Committee on Ways and Means has conducted oversight of
the IRS and the need for modernization. On February 11, 2025, the
Committee held a hearing titled ‘‘IRS Return on Investment and
the Need for Modernization,’’ to examine the lack of return on in-
vestment from funding provided by to the IRS by the Inflation Re-
duction Act and the need for information technology modernization
at the agency.2 In modernizing the administration of the tax laws,
the Committee considered how to ease the burden on taxpayers
who are recovering from a natural disaster.
While the IRS has the authority to postpone tax filing deadlines
for taxpayers impacted by federally declared national disasters, the
federal government may take weeks or months to issue such a dec-
laration. In many cases, States have the ability to move at a faster
pace than the federal government when an event necessitates the
declaration of a natural disaster within their borders. A delay in
the issuance of a disaster declaration can lead uncertainty and an
unnecessary burden on the taxpayer as they attempt to maintain
compliance with tax filing deadlines while recovering from a nat-
ural disaster.
To streamline the process and provide relief to taxpayers facing
these natural disasters, this bill authorizes the Secretary of Treas-
ury, in consultation with FEMA and the impacted State, to extend
relief to taxpayers that are impacted by natural disasters by post-
poning federal deadlines prior to a federal disaster declaration
being made. This bill also expands the mandatory extension from
a declared disaster from 60 to 120 days, to allow families to have
additional time to file taxes while recovering from the disaster.
The Committee on Ways and Means is committed to ensuring
that taxpayers facing natural disasters in their area receive relief
from tax deadlines in their time of need. This bill ensures that fam-
ilies have the flexibility to extend their tax deadline while they re-
build and recover after a state declared national disaster.

II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL
A. MODIFICATION OF RULES FOR POSTPONING CERTAIN DEADLINES
BY REASON OF DISASTER (SEC. 2 OF THE BILL AND NEW SEC.
7508A(c) AND SEC. 7508A(e) OF THE CODE)
PRESENT LAW
General time limits for filing tax returns and paying estimated tax
Individuals generally are required to file their Federal income
tax returns by April 15 of the year following the close of a taxable
year.4 Present law also provides that the Secretary may grant rea-
sonable extensions of time for filing such returns.5 Upon applica-
tion on the proper form, Treasury regulations provide an automatic
six-month extension (until October 15 for calendar-year individ-
uals) for any individual timely filing that form and paying the
amount of tax estimated to be due.6
In general, individuals are required to make quarterly estimated
tax payments by April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15
of the following taxable year. Wage withholding is considered to be
a payment of estimated taxes.
Suspension of time periods
In general, the Secretary may specify a period of up to one year
that may be disregarded for performing various acts under the
Code, such as filing tax returns, paying taxes, or filing a claim for
credit or refund of tax, for any taxpayer determined by the Sec-
retary to be affected by a Federally declared disaster,7 a significant
fire,8 or a terroristic or military action9 with respect to any tax li-
ability of the taxpayer.10 In addition, the period specified by the
Secretary may be disregarded in determining the amount of any in-
3Id.
4Sec. 6072.
5Sec. 6081.
6Treas. Reg. sec. 1.6081–4.
7As defined by section 165(i)(5)(A).
8Significant fire means any fire with respect to which assistance is provided under section
420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.
9As defined in section 692(c)(2).

terest, penalty, additional amount, or addition to tax, and the
amount of any credit or refund.
There are special rules provided for pension plans and other em-
ployee benefit plans. The Secretary may prescribe a period of up to
one year which may be disregarded in determining the date by
which any action by a pension or other employee benefit plan, or
by any sponsor, administrator, participant, beneficiary, or other
person with respect to such plan, affected by a Federally declared
disaster, a significant fire, or a terroristic or military action would
be required or permitted to be completed. A plan is not treated as
operating in a manner inconsistent with its terms or in violation
of its terms merely due to disregarding any such periods.
The suspension of time may apply to a wide variety of acts, in-
cluding the (1) filing of any return of income, estate, gift, employ-
ment, or excise tax; (2) payment of any income, estate, gift, employ-
ment, or excise tax; (3) allowance of a credit or refund of any tax;
(4) assessment of any tax; (5) collection of the amount of any liabil-
ity in respect of any tax; (6) notice or demand for payment of any
tax or with respect to any liability of tax; and (7) any other act re-
quired or permitted under the internal revenue laws specified by
the Secretary of the Treasury.11 The types of acts for which time
may be suspended are identified in a related provision and incor-
porated by reference.12
For a tax-related deadline to be postponed under this authority,
the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) generally will publish, as soon
as practicable after the declaration of the disaster, significant fire,
or occurrence of a terroristic or military action, a revenue ruling,
revenue procedure, notice, announcement, news release, or other
guidance authorizing the postponement and describing the acts
postponed, the postponement period, and the location of the cov-
ered disaster area.13
Mandatory 60-day suspension
In the case of a Federally declared disaster, qualified taxpayers
have a mandatory 60-day period that is disregarded in determining
whether the acts listed above were performed in the time pre-
scribed; the amount of any interest, penalty, additional amount, or
addition to tax; and the amount of any credit or refund.14 The 60-
day period begins on the earliest incident date specified in the dec-
laration to which the relevant disaster area relates and ends on the
date which is the later of 60 days after the earliest incident date
so specified or the date such declaration was issued. In the case of
multiple declarations, a separate 60-day period shall be calculated
11Treas. Reg. sec. 301.7508A–1. The regulations note that the IRS may postpone deadlines
for performing certain acts with respect to taxes other than taxes not administered by the IRS
such as firearms tax (chapter 32, section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter 36, section
4461); and alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E).
12Sec. 7508(a)(1)(A) through (K). Under Treasury regulations, additional acts were added to
this list with respect to affected pension plans and affected taxpayers with respect to such plans:
Making contributions to a qualified retirement plan (within the meaning of section 4974(c))
under section 219(f)(3), 404(a)(6), 404(h)(1)(B), or 404(m)(2); making distributions under section
408(d)(4); recharacterizing contributions under section 408A(d)(6); or making a rollover under
section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 408(d)(3). Treas. Reg. sec. 301.7508A–1(c)(1)(iii). In addi-
tion, Revenue Procedure 2018–58, 2018–50 I.R.B. 990, supplements the list of postponed acts
in section 7508(a)(1) and Treasury Regulation section 301.7508A–1(c)(1) with an additional list
of time-sensitive acts.

with respect to each declaration. The 60-day period is disregarded
in determining under the internal revenue laws, in respect of any
tax liability of a qualified taxpayer, whether any of the specified
acts to which the extension applies were performed within the time
prescribed (without regard to any extensions otherwise provided for
periods after the 60-day period). The mandatory 60-day period pro-
vided is in addition to, or concurrent with, any period of suspension
provided by the Secretary. In the case of multiple declarations, a
separate 60-day period shall be calculated with respect to each dec-
laration.
Qualified taxpayers are (1) any individual whose principal resi-
dence is located in a disaster area, (2) any taxpayer if the tax-
payer’s principal place of business (other than the business of per-
forming services as an employee) is located in a disaster area, (3)
any individual who is a relief worker affiliated with a recognized
government or philanthropic organization and who is assisting in
a disaster area, (4) any taxpayer whose records necessary to meet
a deadline for the acts listed above are maintained in a disaster
area, (5) any individual visiting a disaster area who was killed or
injured as a result of the disaster, and (6) solely with respect to a
joint return, any spouse of an individual who is a qualified tax-
payer.
Statute of limitations on credit or refund
In general, a taxpayer is required to file a claim for credit or re-
fund of an overpayment of tax within three years from the time the
return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid,
whichever expires later.15 If the taxpayer did not file a return, the
taxpayer is required to file a claim for credit or refund within two
years from the time the tax was paid.16 No credit or refund is al-
lowed or made after the expiration of this period of limitation, un-
less the taxpayer files a claim for credit or refund within such pe-
riod.17
If a taxpayer files a claim for credit or refund during the three-
year limitation period, the amount of credit or refund is limited to
the portion of tax paid within the three years immediately before
filing the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing
the return.18 If the claim was not filed within the three-year pe-
riod, the amount of credit or refund is limited to the two years im-
mediately preceding the filing of the claim.19
REASONS FOR CHANGE
The Committee believes that taxpayers affected by disaster, sig-
nificant fire, terroristic or military actions should receive prompt
and clear guidance from the IRS to prevent confusion, particularly
when such events occur around tax filing season. The Committee
notes that disasters are typically recognized much more swiftly at
the State level than at the Federal level. Thus, the Committee be-
lieves a State declaration of disaster should be sufficient to allow

the IRS to grant postponements of tax filing and payment dead-
lines and extensions of time for actions related to pension or other
employee benefits plans to affected taxpayers. The Committee also
believes that a lengthened mandatory filing extension period en-
sures taxpayers have sufficient time and resources to recover after
a Federally declared disaster before addressing their tax obliga-
tions.
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION
Under the provision, the Secretary may (after consultation with
the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency),
upon written request of the Governor of a State (or the Mayor of
the District of Columbia), apply the rules of subsection 7508A(a)
(related to disregarded deadlines for filing and payment) and sub-
section 7508A(b) (related to extensions of time for actions required
or permitted to be completed with respect to pension or other em-
ployee benefit plans) to a qualified State declared disaster in the
same manner as a disaster, fire, or action otherwise described in
subsection 7508A(a).
‘‘Qualified State declared disaster’’ is defined to include any nat-
ural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high
water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, vol-
canic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, re-
gardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the
State, which in the determination of the Governor of such State (or
the Mayor of the District of Columbia) causes damage of sufficient
severity and magnitude to warrant the application of the rules of
this proposal.
The term ‘‘State’’ includes the District of Columbia, the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
The provision also extends the mandatory 60-day suspension pe-
riod20 from 60 days to 120 days.
EFFECTIVE DATE
The provision applies to declarations made after the date of en-
actment.

IV. BUDGET EFFECTS OF THE BILL
A. COMMITTEE ESTIMATE OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS
In compliance with clause 3(d) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the following statement is made con-
cerning the effects on the budget of the bill, H.R. 517 as reported.
The estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
is included below.
The bill is estimated to have a negligible effect on Federal fiscal
year budget receipts for the period 2025 through 2034.
B. STATEMENT REGARDING NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX
EXPENDITURES BUDGET AUTHORITY
In compliance with clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee states that the bill in-
volves no new or increased budget authority.
C. COST ESTIMATE PREPARED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
OFFICE
In compliance with clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, requiring a cost estimate prepared by
the CBO, the following statement by CBO is provided.

H.R. 517 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the
rules for postponing certain tax deadlines in response to declared
disasters. The bill would permit the Secretary of the Treasury, in
the case of certain state-declared disasters, to grant filing exten-
sions that are similar to those granted in the event of federally de-
clared disasters. The bill also would increase deadline extensions
from 60 days to 120 days.
The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, stipulates
that revenue estimates provided by the staff of the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation (JCT) are the official estimates for all tax legis-
lation considered by the Congress. CBO therefore incorporates
such estimates into its cost estimates of the effects of legislation.
The revenue estimates for the bill were provided by JCT.1 JCT esti-
mates that the bill would reduce federal revenues by an insignifi-
cant amount.
CBO estimates that it would cost less than $500,000 over the
2025–2030 period to implement the bill. Any related spending
would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Jennifer Shand. The
estimate was reviewed by John McClelland, Director of Tax Anal-
ysis.

B. STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
With respect to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the
House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the bill does
not authorize funding, so no statement of general performance
goals and objectives is required.
C. APPLICABILITY OF HOUSE RULE XXI, CLAUSE 5(b)
Rule XXI 5(b) of the Rules of the House of Representatives pro-
vides, in part, that ‘‘A bill or joint resolution, amendment, or con-
ference report carrying a Federal income tax rate increase may not
be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a
vote of not less than three-fifths of the Members voting, a quorum
being present.’’ The Committee has carefully reviewed the bill, and
states that the bill does not provide such a Federal income tax rate
