HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM AND HYPOXIA RESEARCH AND
CONTROL AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2025
JULY1 (legislative day, JUNE30), 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 93]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 93) to amend the Harmful Algal
Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 to address
harmful algal blooms, and for other purposes, having considered
the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and an
amendment to the title and recommends that the bill do pass.1
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 93, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Re-
search and Control Amendments Act of 2025, is to amend the
Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act
(HABHRCA) of 19982 to address harmful algal blooms, and for
other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur when environmental condi-
tions promote the rapid growth of large numbers of single-celled
marine algae, either microscopic or macroscopic phytoplankton. Ex-
cess nutrient inputs, changes in temperature or amounts of light,
and turbulence in the water column are all known to influence the
outbreak of algal blooms. Human influences can exacerbate algal
blooms by increasing nutrient availability via agricultural and mu-
1At the markup, S. 93 was ordered to be reported without amendment, but post-markup, a
technical amendment to the title required the bill to be reported favorably with an amendment.

nicipal runoff and transporting exotic species into an area.3 These
blooms often discolor the water and result in red tides or brown
tides. HABs occur when some or all the phytoplankton in the bloom
produce toxins harmful to humans, fish, invertebrates, and other
marine organisms. In addition to producing toxins, HABs may have
negative impacts such as clogging or lacerating fish’s gills, or block-
ing the sunlight available to aquatic plants beneath the bloom.
HABs can also rapidly deplete oxygen, known as hypoxia, killing
fish and other marine animals and plants. In aquatic systems, hy-
poxia refers to a situation where the concentration of dissolved oxy-
gen is reduced to less than two to three parts per million.4 Hypoxic
areas, sometimes called dead zones, frequently occur in coastal and
estuarine areas where rivers bring freshwater to the ocean. As nu-
trient-rich waters are brought from freshwater systems, these ex-
cess nutrients stimulate the rapid growth of algae. The algae begin
to die when this explosive growth has consumed all available nutri-
ents. As the dead algae sink to the seafloor, they decompose, aided
by oxygen-consuming bacteria. As these bacteria consume most of
the available oxygen, a dead zone develops. Animals that can swim
away are less affected by these dead zones; however, slow-moving
fauna, such as shellfish, are particularly susceptible to hypoxia.
Just one HAB event can cost local economies tens of millions of dol-
lars.5
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 93 would do the following:
• Reauthorize HABHRCA through 2030.
• Expand harmful algal bloom assessments to include all water
bodies that contain HABs.
• Codify the National Harmful Algal Bloom Observing Network.
• Expand the definition of the term ‘‘harmful algal bloom’’.
• Increase the authorized appropriation from $20.5 million to
$27.5 million. Of these sums, $19.5 million would be author-
ized for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), and $8 million would be authorized for the Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA).
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 93, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Con-
trol Amendments Act of 2025, was introduced on January 14, 2025,
by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senators Baldwin, Collins,
Cornyn, Merkley, Peters, and Whitehouse) and was referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Sen-
ate. Senators Murkowski, Coons, Padilla, Cassidy, Wicker, Moreno,
Schiff, and King are additional cosponsors. On February 5, 2025,
the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote,
ordered S. 93 reported favorably without amendment. After the

quired S. 93 to be reported favorably with an amendment.
118th Congress
S. 3348, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and
Control Amendments Act of 2024, was introduced on November 27,
2023, by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senator Baldwin) and
was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Trans-
portation of the Senate. It was cosponsored by Senators
Blumenthal, King, Peters, Murkowski, Kennedy, Merkley, Wicker,
Collins, Padilla, Butler, Whitehouse, Cassidy, Cornyn, and Coons.
On July 31, 2024, the Committee met in open Executive Session
and, by voice vote, ordered S. 3348 reported favorably with an
amendment (in the nature of a substitute).
105th Congress to 115th Congress
The original Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and
Control Act of 19986 was introduced in November 1997 by Senator
Olympia Snowe. It was further amended and reauthorized by the
Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2004,7 the
Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amend-
ments Act of 2014,8 and the National Integrated Drought Informa-
tion System Reauthorization Act of 2018.9
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,

S. 93 would reauthorize and expand activities administered by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the En-
vironmental Protection Agency related to research, observation,
and control of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. Harmful blooms
occur when colonies of algae grow uncontrollably and become toxic,
which also may lead to reduced oxygen (or hypoxia) in the water.
The bill would authorize the appropriation of $27.5 million annu-
ally from 2026 through 2030 for those purposes, which includes ex-
panding the membership and activities of an existing interagency
task force and establishing a new program to create technologies
to mitigate and control harmful algal blooms. In 2024, those agen-
cies allocated $40 million for activities to mitigate harmful algal
blooms.
The bill also would authorize the appropriation of $2 million each
year over the 2026–2030 period to address harmful blooms and hy-
poxia events that would have a significant detrimental effect on the
environment, economy, or public health of a state.
CBO estimates that the bill will be enacted in 2025 and that the
authorized amounts will be provided in each year. On that basis
and using the spending patterns for similar activities, CBO esti-
mates that implementing the bill would cost $130 million over the
2025–2030 period and $17 million after 2030.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).

REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 93 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 4:
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amend-
ments Act of 2025’’.

Section 5:
Section 2. Amendments to the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia
Research and Control Act of 1998.
This section would add the Department of Energy to the Inter-
Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia (Task
Force) and require the Task Force to expand HAB and hypoxia as-
sessments. Task Force hypoxia assessments would be broadened to
include food safety and security, environmental stressors, and eval-
uations of methods to reduce, mitigate, and control hypoxia and its
environmental impacts. This section also would eliminate outdated
reports, reduce regional HAB reports, and require a national action
strategy for HABS with regional chapters. The Task Force would
consult with relevant entities, including Indian tribes.
This section would update the national harmful algal bloom and
hypoxia program to cover all water bodies and expand its duties re-
garding grant funding for new projects.
This section would describe NOAA’s authorities and duties re-
garding HABs and require that all data follow the standards and
protocols outlined in the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation
System Act of 200910 and be available in the National Integrated
Coastal and Ocean Observation System.
This section would codify the EPA’s duties in coordination with
NOAA and the National HAB Observing Network. It would require
NOAA to work with the EPA and research universities to establish
a national incubator program to develop prevention strategies and
control technologies for HABs. NOAA would provide merit-based
funding through existing grant programs and create a framework
for assessing and prioritizing prevention strategies.
This section would expand the definition of HAB to include
macroalgae and cyanobacteria, remove the definition of U.S. coastal
waters, and add the definitions for the terms ‘‘harmful algal bloom
and hypoxia event’’, ‘‘Indian tribe’’, ‘‘Native Hawaiian organiza-
tion’’, ‘‘subsistence use’’, and ‘‘Tribal organization’’. It would author-
ize $19.5 million for NOAA and $8 million for EPA for fiscal years
2026 through 2030 and allow fund transfers between agencies to
assist with HAB and hypoxia events.

Section 6:
Section 3. Other harmful algal bloom and hypoxia matters.
This section would allow NOAA to enter into agreements and
grants with State and local entities and/or Indian tribes to fund re-
lief efforts for harmful algal bloom or hypoxia events of national
significance. It would allow the appropriate Federal official to
waive non-Federal share requirements in certain circumstances.
This section would update the considerations for determining
whether a hypoxia or HAB event is an event of national signifi-
cance. It would add definitions for the terms ‘‘Indian tribe’’, ‘‘Native
Hawaiian organization’’, ‘‘subsistence use’’, and ‘‘Tribal organiza-

HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM AND HYPOXIA RESEARCH AND
CONTROL AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2025
JULY1 (legislative day, JUNE30), 2025.—Ordered to be printed
Mr. CRUZ, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, submitted the following
R E P O R T
[To accompany S. 93]
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to
which was referred the bill (S. 93) to amend the Harmful Algal
Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 to address
harmful algal blooms, and for other purposes, having considered
the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and an
amendment to the title and recommends that the bill do pass.1
PURPOSE OF THE BILL
The purpose of S. 93, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Re-
search and Control Amendments Act of 2025, is to amend the
Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act
(HABHRCA) of 19982 to address harmful algal blooms, and for
other purposes.
BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur when environmental condi-
tions promote the rapid growth of large numbers of single-celled
marine algae, either microscopic or macroscopic phytoplankton. Ex-
cess nutrient inputs, changes in temperature or amounts of light,
and turbulence in the water column are all known to influence the
outbreak of algal blooms. Human influences can exacerbate algal
blooms by increasing nutrient availability via agricultural and mu-
1At the markup, S. 93 was ordered to be reported without amendment, but post-markup, a
technical amendment to the title required the bill to be reported favorably with an amendment.

nicipal runoff and transporting exotic species into an area.3 These
blooms often discolor the water and result in red tides or brown
tides. HABs occur when some or all the phytoplankton in the bloom
produce toxins harmful to humans, fish, invertebrates, and other
marine organisms. In addition to producing toxins, HABs may have
negative impacts such as clogging or lacerating fish’s gills, or block-
ing the sunlight available to aquatic plants beneath the bloom.
HABs can also rapidly deplete oxygen, known as hypoxia, killing
fish and other marine animals and plants. In aquatic systems, hy-
poxia refers to a situation where the concentration of dissolved oxy-
gen is reduced to less than two to three parts per million.4 Hypoxic
areas, sometimes called dead zones, frequently occur in coastal and
estuarine areas where rivers bring freshwater to the ocean. As nu-
trient-rich waters are brought from freshwater systems, these ex-
cess nutrients stimulate the rapid growth of algae. The algae begin
to die when this explosive growth has consumed all available nutri-
ents. As the dead algae sink to the seafloor, they decompose, aided
by oxygen-consuming bacteria. As these bacteria consume most of
the available oxygen, a dead zone develops. Animals that can swim
away are less affected by these dead zones; however, slow-moving
fauna, such as shellfish, are particularly susceptible to hypoxia.
Just one HAB event can cost local economies tens of millions of dol-
lars.5
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS
S. 93 would do the following:
• Reauthorize HABHRCA through 2030.
• Expand harmful algal bloom assessments to include all water
bodies that contain HABs.
• Codify the National Harmful Algal Bloom Observing Network.
• Expand the definition of the term ‘‘harmful algal bloom’’.
• Increase the authorized appropriation from $20.5 million to
$27.5 million. Of these sums, $19.5 million would be author-
ized for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), and $8 million would be authorized for the Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA).
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
S. 93, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Con-
trol Amendments Act of 2025, was introduced on January 14, 2025,
by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senators Baldwin, Collins,
Cornyn, Merkley, Peters, and Whitehouse) and was referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Sen-
ate. Senators Murkowski, Coons, Padilla, Cassidy, Wicker, Moreno,
Schiff, and King are additional cosponsors. On February 5, 2025,
the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote,
ordered S. 93 reported favorably without amendment. After the

markup, the bill had a technical amendment to the title which re-
quired S. 93 to be reported favorably with an amendment.
118th Congress
S. 3348, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and
Control Amendments Act of 2024, was introduced on November 27,
2023, by Senator Sullivan (for himself and Senator Baldwin) and
was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Trans-
portation of the Senate. It was cosponsored by Senators
Blumenthal, King, Peters, Murkowski, Kennedy, Merkley, Wicker,
Collins, Padilla, Butler, Whitehouse, Cassidy, Cornyn, and Coons.
On July 31, 2024, the Committee met in open Executive Session
and, by voice vote, ordered S. 3348 reported favorably with an
amendment (in the nature of a substitute).
105th Congress to 115th Congress
The original Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and
Control Act of 19986 was introduced in November 1997 by Senator
Olympia Snowe. It was further amended and reauthorized by the
Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2004,7 the
Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amend-
ments Act of 2014,8 and the National Integrated Drought Informa-
tion System Reauthorization Act of 2018.9
ESTIMATED COSTS
In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing
Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate,

S. 93 would reauthorize and expand activities administered by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the En-
vironmental Protection Agency related to research, observation,
and control of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. Harmful blooms
occur when colonies of algae grow uncontrollably and become toxic,
which also may lead to reduced oxygen (or hypoxia) in the water.
The bill would authorize the appropriation of $27.5 million annu-
ally from 2026 through 2030 for those purposes, which includes ex-
panding the membership and activities of an existing interagency
task force and establishing a new program to create technologies
to mitigate and control harmful algal blooms. In 2024, those agen-
cies allocated $40 million for activities to mitigate harmful algal
blooms.
The bill also would authorize the appropriation of $2 million each
year over the 2026–2030 period to address harmful blooms and hy-
poxia events that would have a significant detrimental effect on the
environment, economy, or public health of a state.
CBO estimates that the bill will be enacted in 2025 and that the
authorized amounts will be provided in each year. On that basis
and using the spending patterns for similar activities, CBO esti-
mates that implementing the bill would cost $130 million over the
2025–2030 period and $17 million after 2030.
The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall within budg-
et function 300 (natural resources and environment).

Director, Congressional Budget Office.
REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT
Because S. 93 does not create any new programs, the legislation
will have no additional regulatory impact, and will result in no ad-
ditional reporting requirements. The legislation will have no fur-
ther effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses
regulated, the economic impact of such regulation, the personal pri-
vacy of affected individuals, or the paperwork required from such
individuals and businesses.
CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING
In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing
Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions
contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congres-
sionally directed spending items under the rule.

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
Section 1. Short title.
This section would provide that the bill may be cited as the
‘‘Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amend-
ments Act of 2025’’.
Section 2. Amendments to the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia
Research and Control Act of 1998.
This section would add the Department of Energy to the Inter-
Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia (Task
Force) and require the Task Force to expand HAB and hypoxia as-
sessments. Task Force hypoxia assessments would be broadened to
include food safety and security, environmental stressors, and eval-
uations of methods to reduce, mitigate, and control hypoxia and its
environmental impacts. This section also would eliminate outdated
reports, reduce regional HAB reports, and require a national action
strategy for HABS with regional chapters. The Task Force would
consult with relevant entities, including Indian tribes.
This section would update the national harmful algal bloom and
hypoxia program to cover all water bodies and expand its duties re-
garding grant funding for new projects.
This section would describe NOAA’s authorities and duties re-
garding HABs and require that all data follow the standards and
protocols outlined in the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation
System Act of 200910 and be available in the National Integrated
Coastal and Ocean Observation System.
This section would codify the EPA’s duties in coordination with
NOAA and the National HAB Observing Network. It would require
NOAA to work with the EPA and research universities to establish
a national incubator program to develop prevention strategies and
control technologies for HABs. NOAA would provide merit-based
funding through existing grant programs and create a framework
for assessing and prioritizing prevention strategies.
This section would expand the definition of HAB to include
macroalgae and cyanobacteria, remove the definition of U.S. coastal
waters, and add the definitions for the terms ‘‘harmful algal bloom
and hypoxia event’’, ‘‘Indian tribe’’, ‘‘Native Hawaiian organiza-
tion’’, ‘‘subsistence use’’, and ‘‘Tribal organization’’. It would author-
ize $19.5 million for NOAA and $8 million for EPA for fiscal years
2026 through 2030 and allow fund transfers between agencies to
assist with HAB and hypoxia events.
Section 3. Other harmful algal bloom and hypoxia matters.
This section would allow NOAA to enter into agreements and
grants with State and local entities and/or Indian tribes to fund re-
lief efforts for harmful algal bloom or hypoxia events of national
significance. It would allow the appropriate Federal official to
waive non-Federal share requirements in certain circumstances.
This section would update the considerations for determining
whether a hypoxia or HAB event is an event of national signifi-
cance. It would add definitions for the terms ‘‘Indian tribe’’, ‘‘Native
Hawaiian organization’’, ‘‘subsistence use’’, and ‘‘Tribal organiza-
